Chemistry: 
The duo of Inuzuka to their dogs is unlike another else in the shinobi world.  This partnership has advanced to such a degree that they are able to syncronize attacks with complete chemistry.  They are able to communicate as though through verbal communication, which enables the use of Fang over Fang, and proper usage of transformations!
