Focus: 
This individual has great focus.  They are able to focus on a target, increasing accuracy and the likelyhood of that target getting out of their sight is decreased.



Amazing Focus: 
With an amazing degree of focus, this individual is capable of narrowing their vision to an opponent.  This dramatically increases accuracy, and reduces the likelihood of said target escaping.  However, this provides tunnel vision, allowing for easier attacks on this person.

Locked-On: 
Like a Jet-fighter locking on to their target, this individual has incredible focus.  They are capable of blotting out everything else around them.  This increases their accuracy to deadly limits, allowing the usage of even the most precise hits.  Once locked on, the likelyhood of target escaping is null; but the risk of being blindsided is even higher.
