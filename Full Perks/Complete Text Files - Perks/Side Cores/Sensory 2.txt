Faint Sense: 
This person is able to faintly sense the presence of any chakra around them.  While they have low-grade sensory abilities, they are unable to attach the presence of chakra to any individual, and cannot gage specific levels of chakra.

 


Acute Sense: This person is able to detect the presence of chakra around them to some degree of accuracy.  They are able to precisely tell the levels of chakra of an individual, and track accurately from close to mid ranges.

Trained Sense: 
This person is a trained sensor.  The presence of chakra around them is very familiar, and they can attach identities to individuals after becoming accustom to their chakra.  They are able to finely gage the measure of one's chakra, and can track from close to long ranges.

Sixth Sense: This person is completely attuned with the chakra around them.  They are so accustom to the flows of chakra that they can detect even the slightest differences innately.  With such heightened senses, they are able to differentiate between individuals caught in an illusion, and those not - and can track individuals for miles in any direction.
Note: This applies to chakra levels, chakra identity and genjutsu awareness.
