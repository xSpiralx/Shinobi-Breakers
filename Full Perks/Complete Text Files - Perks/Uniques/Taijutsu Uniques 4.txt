Boxer: 
Deftly trained, and not to be taken lightly, a boxer's punches pack more than a regular hit.  Each blow from a boxer has unrivalled concussive force, a jarring blow with every hit.

Kick Boxer: 
A taijutsu style not used by many, this individual is a strong physical kickboxer.  Each kick is a winding blow, they are quick on their feet, and faster to strike; able to trip up their opponents with ease.

Grappler: 
The grappler fights to force their opponent into a submissive hold.  Once in, only the strongest can tear themselves free.
