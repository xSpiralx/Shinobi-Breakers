<font color = white>&#34;...wah...&#34;</font>

Subconciously she managed to grab the cup of juice and take a sip of it - her eyes went back to normal and all the trippy stuff was gone. Fubuki was back to standing on the green tile, or rather she realized she stood on it the whole time.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...so how does the problem solving work? D-do we constantly get drugged in this game?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She paused for a moment as she reached into her judo cloak and took out a piece of paper to read. Her gaze skimmed through it before she found the passage she was looking for.

<font color = white>&#34;however it only lasts for a short while and....and be cooled with a water source....where that water source may come from..in a village like our own?...im not sure...so be careful of this...mhm...&#34;</font>

When Fubuki&#39;s gaze went unto her..there would be a wet towel mhm for them to and a dry towel for them to cool their skin with mhm

==================== katon burn perk ==================
Name: 

Incendiary Flame  

Desc:

 This character has mastered the art of sticky flame. By carefully molding their chakra, they produce fire from a chakra fuel that is adhesive and sticks to their target once they are struck. This makes it very difficult to remove and the fire will continue burning unless the victim employs precious seconds putting out the flames. 

Note:

Those struck by a fire technique continue to burn for petty injury for two turns. The victim may use their offensive action to put it out or use a water source of medium size or above.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) It was frankly amazing that Fubuki somehow didn&#39;t suspect anything when stepping onto the red tile, only when her foot landed on it did she understand the gravity of the situation. A part of her soul began crying for help.

<font color = white>&#34;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&#34;</font>

Her whole body was surrounded by fire! Her hair and skin got completely ruined and obviously she was burning everywhere. It wasn&#39;t much fire but it was enough to really scare her. While Koume spoke, Fubuki fell to the ground and started rolling around - when she was thrown a wet towel she&#39;d turn into a flaming burrito for a few seconds, rolling with it. Then she fire was put out.

Fubuki slowly stood up and exhaled, she grabbed the other towel and started cleaning herself. <font color = white>&#34;Koume...this is...totally great training, yeah...&#34;</font> she said in pain.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would nod as she watched the walls allow a small hole to open as they stepped on the purple tile. A small tuble with a round point came outwards from both sides.

It was then...&#39;crackle crackle&#39; it was then...an electric shock happened!..moving from left to right...using the water that the human body was made of as a conductor.

<i>zing!!! CRACKLE...ZUM ZUM ZUM...ZAMOOOO!</i>

It was then it ended...however they would notice that the effects they suffered were worse that the poisen. But would last the less time than the poisen she used.

<font color = white>&#34;You would notice this is a lightning attack this time...these cost..an effect of electrocution....mm..no..a nervous system..error.i believe its called. It messes with your motor functions to a further degree and also messes with a casters handseal speed..not to meantion your how fast you move across the field...&#34;</font>

She paused as she laughed a bit akwardly..while placing her hands on her hips.

<font color = white>&#34;then theres the fact that you can also..stop a persons movement completely...if i remeber correctly from the stories ive heard...if hit directly with a technique itself.&#34;</font>

=========== more info below of the status aliment below ===========

Name:

Numbing Joltage  

Desc:

This character has developed the ability to sustain an electrical current that courses through the body of their victim if they are unfortunate enough to be struck by a lightning technique. The current is delivered as a numbing jolt of electricity that stuns the victim, slowing their reaction times considerably. 

Note:

Those struck by an electrifying lightning technique lose two steps of speed, agility, hand seal tempo, and tile movement until the end of their next turn.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) Perhaps it was evil, or perhaps it was kind, but at least she wouldn&#39;t see what was coming this time. After all it was much easier to instantly feel pain than to see it about to hit her even if it was for a split second.

Fubuki didn&#39;t have time to react to the lightning which shocked her whole body, spiking up her hair and making her stand up completely. When the shock was over everyone nearby could smell the girl was a bit burnt, right before falling to the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I-I-.---I---II....IIII...&#34;</font> the nervous shock had  been so severe she couldn&#39;t even speak, Fubuki was a frozen statue on the floor except for the occassional twitch. However this lasted only a few seconds before she stood up and regained her movement.

<font color = white>&#34;I...I&#39;m alive...&#34;</font> she looked at her hands in amazement. She had no idea training could get so rough.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: I-is that it?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would laugh a bit before shaking her head meaning no.

<font color = white>&#34;u-unfortunately not..theres about...one more you might have to suffer through...before we go into..the next section.&#34;</font>

She paused.

<font color = white>&#34;b-but i dont really have a suiton tile..so your lucky mhm!..&#34;</font> With a light wink..she found herself continueing there after. <font color = white>&#34; For suiton..it mostly messes with your movement across the field...if i remeber correctly...same with fuuton....with the case it knocks you back....so your all fine on that front&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: if i had something to add..hmm..it would be to teach you about...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s eyes widened, her soul was ready to die as soon as Koume mentioned there was one more tile to go. But thankfully the game was still in early access and the suiton tile hadn&#39;t been added, so she sighed out of happiness and laid on the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m free...from the pain--&#34;</font>

And then the obstacle course turned into the other one.

<font color = white>&#34;...Fuck.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would poof away her previous course and summoned a new one into existance. Upon returning...she looked to the yellow mushroom.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;NOT YOU.&#34;</font>

She immediately threw the shuriken towards the mushroom, hitting it on its big dumb-looking head. Fubuki had a lot of resentment for those things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Oh is she playing the game again?

She tried to hide the fact she was giggling at...the resentment she saw. They were off duty..so it should be..f-fine..she hoped.

====================== mushroom! =============

The yellow mushroom found themselves being attacked..and moved forwards to try and attack them before the shuriken hit their body!...however it..the shuriken hit their squishy body before they collaped on the ground to play dead!

<i>ploop!!!</i>
=====================================

<font color = white>&#34; you see...y-you see...a-ahem..you see...the reason why the mushroom couldnt counter you is because of they way the order of attacks work in this world. Perhaps made this way by the shogan himself. &#34;</font> She found herself..pausing breifly..before speaking once more.

<font color = white>&#34;Shurikenjutsu happens..first...and taijutsu happened after it mhm...however it expands to something more...as after a bit of experimentation and a few lost lifes of our iwagakurian shinobi...we have a detailed list..to make it easier for the newer generation&#34;</font>

Reaching into her pocket...she held up a piece of paper for them to read off of.
