<font color = white>&#34;Nnnn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) did not return the smile. She sized up the pink-purple haired girls twintails, finding them almost a completely different color in her own mind. Shuye cleared her throat quietly.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m not--&#34;</font> How could she best explain this without raising suspicion on herself? It was clear after looking at Shuye for a few seconds that her features were slightly different from those around her. Like she wasn&#39;t from around here; a foreigner.

<font color = white>&#34;...You were compliment me, okay.&#34;</font> Shuye finally seemed to relax a little. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you, I guess. I like your hairstyle.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) spares a wary glance to the boy now near him. As they step away, he follows them with narrowed eyes before swinging his gaze over to the devious one.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re welcome! And thank you, too,&#34;</font> she said, appreciating the compliment. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kohana Hoshino, by the way. It&#39;s nice to meet you. I hope we can be friends.&#34;</font> She extended her hand in a friendly gesture, hoping to bridge the gap between them.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;And IIIII&#39;m Venturo. Nice meetin&#39; you too.&#34;</font>

Yeah. He was totally being spoken to in this whole thing, for sure!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) recognized the name. <font color = white>&#34;A couple people have been talking about you.&#34;</font> She remembered at the visit to Akihabara, the girl had initially shown interest in being made into a plushie. Unlike Shuye though, she didn&#39;t have interest in playing the game to be the winner of that privilege. Shuye is hesitant, but does carefully reach out to grip her hand.

<font color = white>&#34;Zhu, Shuye. Meixun is my little brother, if you&#39;ve seen him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) grit those teeth.
The Adversary had endured the full blunt of his weight thrown into that knee.
And then?! Used themselves like a missive, driving a kick for his center. 

Katora raised arms in defense, catching that dropkick against the bony oversides of his arms and finding himself sliding back over the stone tiles. It was heavy. Unexpectedly heavy for someone of their size. 

Enough to leave lingering pain in his flesh, following that defense. He pushed back, no doubt sending them to their feet. A snappy twist sent his shin scything in for the kid&#39;s ribs! 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re tougher than you look. And you hit hard. A Martial Artist, huh?&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you, Shuye. What have people been saying about me?&#34;</font> she asked, her tone friendly and intrigued. <font color = white>&#34;And I haven&#39;t met Meixun yet, but I&#39;d love to. It&#39;s always good to know more people.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Taijutsu is more Raku&#39;s thing.&#34;</font> [1/3]

A hammer fist would shoot in suddenly, it looked as though the Mugen brother was trying to beat the Fuma&#39;s face in with an invisible icepick! The slugfest was on.
