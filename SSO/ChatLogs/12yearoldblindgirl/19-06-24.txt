<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I dunno what an exhibitionist is
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's an art thing.

She even counted on her fingers some. <font color = white>&#34;Heeeeeyy....&#34;</font> she came to her conclusion.

<font color = white>&#34;She&#39;s right! If I got 50... And give -you- 50 then I&#39;m at zero.. An&#39; you give it -back- I&#39;m just right back where I started!&#34;</font> she pointed toward Fubiki and Hideo in a accusory manner. <font color = white>&#34;You two are -bad- at math!&#34;</font> she did not think they were pulling one over her, but merely that their math was off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: I never said that I was fine with it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at Tsuneko a bit frustated before sighing, her gaze directed towards the loan shark.

<font color = white>&#34;That was the point, to fool you! But then SHE--&#34;</font> Fubuki pointed at Tsuneko who was literally right next to her, <font color = white>&#34;--ruined it all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You better not be fine with it or I'll poke your eye, with a stick.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) asks: Why would you poke my eye now?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: 'Course I did. In fact I didn't try, I did do it.
