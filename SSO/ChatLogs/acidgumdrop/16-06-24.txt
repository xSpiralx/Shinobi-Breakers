<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was slightly disappointed that there was no resulting child from Mugen's descent.
His focus moved over to the brand new superior who'd only recently arrived. Wondering what exactly she had entailed in comparison to the other two fully fledged Shinobi.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) glanced back to smirk. One couldn't see it on his face, due to the mask, but it's enough to see it in his eyes. So smug, this one.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Gonna put a frog in your room...
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Frogs taste pretty good, roasted.

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) asks: ...?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: -IF- i find a frog in my room, you will have pole sized dent in your skull boy.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Yeah, eatin' 'em's real.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hehe, you wouldn't be able to prove it was me though.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I 'unno, I just never thought about eating a frog.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Tread carefully, Hideo. Too many dents in your head will leave you unable to throw mountains in the future.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Y-You're kidding, right Katora?

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: In fact, it'll equal bad everything.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Bad everything?! Damn... Guess I need to make it so my head can't be dented then!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Snakes? only snake i know is that bastard Sato.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just don't get hit on the head.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: And if Snakes are anything like him, i suggest you stay away lassie.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a Sage&#39;s nod to the notetaking. Glad to spread the good word of not receiving skull-dents from concussive forces.

<font color = white>&#34;So swift today, Hideo. You&#39;re putting all that experience from the last test to good use. Now. How are those reflexes?&#34;</font> 

There&#39;s a water-logged sack of practice kunai beside him. Wooden in make. Blunt and unlikely to truly cause any serious injury. But. They were aerodynamic all the same in his hands, even with the added weight-factor from absorbing water. 

He loosed a pair.
Two wooden, rounded points, streaking right for Hideo&#39;s knee-pits.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) asks: You dont have to tell me old timer. Called me old? can you believe that?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: So, do we have a deal?

<font color = white>&#34;So you weren&#39;t a rude lad, but a feisty lass.&#34;</font> he shakes his head, realizing that the age of cute and proper ladies had long ended, now instead replaced by this punk mentality <font color = white>&#34;This old man only has cheap stuff now. No weapons. Not like I would sell such dangerous things to a greenhorn ayway..&#34;</font> he chuckles, moving closer to the iron vessel</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) sighed - she finally got gendered properly but she didn&#39;t get any good deal.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay, fuck. I gotta leave. Fuck shit fuck!&#34;</font> she muttered to herself while running off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Young man.. you aren't old. To me, you are just a bit better than these kids.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) slowly enters what he thinks is the academy, before taking a quiet spot to himself as he proceeded to watch the ongoing lesson while rubbin his bald head out of habit.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (Only fitting.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (Ready to post at exactly X-10)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) wonders for a time where his brother could be, though he eventually yields his mind to focus on himself.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) witnessed a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.

(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Oh good heavens, that's a lot of words...

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (tl;dr battle royale,  get hit twice u lose)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) slings his arm around Hideo's shoulder, his eyes searching for the troublemarker</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (Pretty much, standard CQC drill type thing.)
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Gosu(The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) OOCs: (So agility ppl are eating rn)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (so when can we start, rn?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (RP tossing on some belts, and sprad out!)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Maaaaan I'm not great at hand-to-hand... Guess it's time to push past my limits!!! Raaah!!!!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) approaches the crate first, slinging a Vectro Belt over his shoulder and scurrying off. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A ban on throwing things... hah.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'll make it work.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Heh, sounds quite difficult..
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: That's the spirit, test previously established limits!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the rules of engagement from the light-haired senior who hosted this streamer game. It was unusual, something he wasn&#39;t used to, but truthfully it did sound a little fun. It was a raw test of agility and not much else.

  <font color = white>&#34;Seems like it&#39;ll be based mostly on chance if you make it to the end. I&#39;m game for a little flag tag.&#34;</font> He leans off the wall.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So what are streamers?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) hummed softly, not too sure how to come out of this successfully. She doubted she'd win but figured it'd be a good way to pass the time so she moved toward the crate and grabbed herself a velcro belt with one streamer each, strapping both to her hips.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) picks his nose without a care in the world, before tossing the booger to the side. Luckily, confucianism made it impossible for younger people to criticize the elderly.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohohoh.. Iwagakure sure loves its violence.&#34;</font> he comments as he takes a seat, fully intending to watch the brawl unfold</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: What are streamers? The red and blue fabric attached to your velcro belts.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) begins to roll his shoulders and grins at Katora. Knowing that the masked boy couldn&#39;t use his eagle eye to snipe flags off of belts. With his arms rudimentarily stretched he steps forward! Grabbing a belt and affixing the little streamers to the velcro spots on the belt.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright! I&#39;m gonna win- Wait how do we win this game? Do we collect a bunch of flags?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So ya lose both, you lose?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) barked out a laugh <font color = white>&#34;A fun game I suppose if not simple, if only I had some sake to sip as I watched.&#34;</font> She said notig the blonde had not replied to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;A more fitting name would be Royale Rumble.&#34;</font> She said as she stalked closer to the crate to reach in and secure her belt across her waist.
<font color = white>&#34;Let us dance then!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Percisely!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Who do I room with?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Or are we decidin' our opponents?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked to the set of velcro belts and put one of them on, adjusting it so it&#39;d feel comfortable for her. It would probablyy be a bit chaotic right from the get go so she did the smart thing of gettting a bit further away the moment she could to not get instantly defeated by everyone at once.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font> she breathed in, slowly inhaling and exhaling. <font color = white>&#34;Who wants to go?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Hmm...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (.... how tf did I fuck up typing roleplay)
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: <Already forming small teams, a coveted aspect of shinobi velcro belt. They're quick learners..Buttt-there can only be one winner..>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (my ass said rolapley...)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: W-Wait no seriously how do we win?! We just lose if we get both flags taken but like- Do we win if we get more belts than someone else?
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Last person standing wins!
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Duh..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh, cool
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: It's a -free for all-
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh so we don't hold onto the flags or nothin'. Goooooot it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) scratched the thinking side of his skull and then walked forward towards the dark trove to claim a Ninja Velcro Belt. Complete with two streaming wisps on each side of his waist.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Let go of me.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It sounds like... the kind of game where getting jumped is very likely.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Perfect!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Forming a squad seems like the ideal counter, but... going it alone sounds more fun.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (Sorry, only grabbed you to drop a RP wall.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (I saw the erp, you a fiend
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well- I've got my belt. Time to run off...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) squinted a little.  Another game to play, honestly she was currently not a fan of these kinds of games...    Or well, games in general after the one earlier thus she was currently trying to decide to she should take part in this or not.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm...  Choices.&#34;</font>

She whispered to herself softly.  Though she would find herself having a question.

<font color = white>&#34;Um.  If we capture other peoples flags.  Do they count towards our life or just shows we eliminated people?&#34;</font>

This was important.  If it counted towards one&#39;s life, then those who were agile would win.  If it didn&#39;t then those who formed groups and ganged up on others would win...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Hideo!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He-- motherfucker.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Would began to strap her two streamers on her belt, the girl had questioned if she was gonna be able to possibly. Her attention would focus on several thingsf, she wasn&#39;t quite sure what she would do for team mates.. she seemed like she would be alone.. without warning she would run off as well.. 

<font color = white>&#34;Seeing as this free for all.. I am go hide..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: They do not, hurting a enemy in battle doesn't magically restore your wounds silly.
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Protect your streamers at all costs.
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Now grab your belts and get out there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) entered the academy, his jaw tightening slightly. He felt uneasy about being late to the festivities.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) entered the building a little late, be as it may, it doesn't seem like there'd be much need to be present right then and there. The trickster's repetitve instruction echoed throughout the halls, surrounded by the voice of his comradery--essentially, it seemed to be a battle royale of sorts.

A crabby voice caught his attention, recognizing that as his sister-- waved and pointed toward the collection of connecitve belts assigned. Seeing as everyone was taking one, he assumed it was only right for him to grab onto one as well. He bowed to the trickster, took himself a belt, made his way further into the building--shooting a leer at the new Kunoichi in between Cho'Kuome and Mugen. No time to recognize her signature at the moment...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) began to walk forward with belt in hand. If his brother was here, having them to partner up with would be the most ideal strategy. Though with his absence, he would have to find another way to prosper.
  <font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to go toe-to-toe, or be my friend in this game just come stand by me.&#34;</font> Is all he says.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) went ahead and secured himself a set of streamers and the harness they hung from. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll select a room and loiter there, I suppose,&#34;</font> he says to himself, though it&#39;s intentionally audible as he made his way down the hall. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers: Well.. That should keep them entertained for awhile, at least...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) waited in place for the right time to strike, she was completely focused on the boy she challenged.

<font color = white>&#34;Name&#39;s Fubuki, I will be the one who takes you down.&#34;</font>

She couldn&#39;t care less about anyone who entered, all that mattered was that she got her fight properly. Once the boy took a step forward Fubuki started running really fast for an academy student, closing the gap between the two albeit just barely and also extending her arm behind her, releasing it forward and aiming at the boy&#39;s streamer - but obviously using no strength, as if she had any.</font></font></font>

She was fast, to say the least. Meaning that he&#39;d have no option other than to combat her.
Instead of countering her attempt, Meixun took to making a swift dodge motion, pushing himself off the trash bin to settle behind the girl.

In the process, his hand darted to grab her unoccupied wrist, an attempt to spin her about in order to find whatever the both of them were searching for: in layman&#39;s terms, Fubuki&#39;s streamer.

His ears twitched slightly, there were more and more entering the bathroom, watching the display...
[1/4 DT, D- Agi, -1 TM due to attack]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) wasn't expecting him to dodge her attack just like that - not only did he know combat stances but he was agile enough to fight in close quarter combat. It was the fight of her life!

Her wrist got grabbed and she was span around before she could do anything, but just as one of the streamers on her belt got revealed she'd lift her leg to block him from touching anything. She kept spinning and used that chance to try and kick his waist, maybe she'd land on his streamer by pure chance.

She paid no attention to the people entering the room, she was fully focused in the fight right now.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a familiar presence enter finally, it was Shuye!
Wait, if this is a ''free-for-all'' battle, doesn't that mean that everyone, including his elder sister, is an oppone--

The boy's thought process was halted by a brush-off, they're equals in technique and striking--but she could maneuver quicker than him... A taxing performance indeed, though the appearance of two potential adversaries opened up more offerings of distraction; either ot himself or to Fubuki.
Her kick seemingly connected with the boy's abdomen, before it quickly revealed to be a ruse to pull Fubuki closer, Meixun's face collapsed voluntarily toward the girl's midsection, aiming to gnash at the belt with his own teeth,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) Both of them seemed to be completely equal in regards to their Taijutsu ability, speed and flexibility. And though this was essentially the hardest set up she could've chosen, Fubuki couldn't be any happier - she couldn't stop smirking.

The moment her kick 'connected' she thought she had won one of the streamers, but of course it couldn't be that easy. She just nearly kicked his abdomen. Thankfully Fubuki wasn't using any strength and even if she was, she was very weak so she didn't have to worry about hurting him.

Meixun's strategy was surprising but not completely unexpected, for she played dirty too. She grabbed the boy by the hair and pulled his head up before letting it go, using her other hand to try and snatch one of his streamers from his belt if he had it there.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) couldn't have made it any more convenient if he attempted it himself. Suddenly, having his hair pulled gave him the staunch opportunity to...

Hug Fubuki. No, really--an embrace... In the middle of their fight. 
Both of Meixun's hands were locking fingers while behind Fubuki's back tightly, his legs followed suit and before long, he was being backpacked--or frontpacked--by the elder teen. The child's facade of a simple hug dissolved by the time his legs wapped around hers--it's archaic, juvenile more accurately, but it was a grapple nonetheless. The best way to circumvent a stalemate? Make it stale.

In reality he was pitting strength against strength, seeing how much time it took before he was snatched off of her and back into the fray of battle. Also, it'd give him time to recognize any... 
Final stands should things get iffy in the process..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s hand reached out towards his belt until her arm couldn&#39;t extend anymore. She couldn&#39;t move her arm - most of her body in fact couldn&#39;t be moved. Fubuki needed a moment to realize she was getting hugged by the kid - thankfully it was a grapple technically so she didn&#39;t even need to be embarrassed about it. It was basically impossible to break out of so yet neither of them could reach for the other&#39;s streamer, so it was some sort of stalemate. She sighed, and spoke as he latched on to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;As much as I like fighting you, there&#39;s no way we&#39;ll ever end our fight properly. Especially with how many people surround us. You wanna go after anyone else, together?&#34;</font>

Of course she struggled so eventually Meixun would be forced to stop grappling her.

Someone was arriving soon--very soon, if they came in by now then they&#39;d more than likely take sides with the currently present Chonamu. A top of things, if they decided to work together.... Given that they both move rather similarly, it could prove to be advantageous in strategizing...

He stretches his neck toward the girl&#39;s ear for a whisper, continuing to hold his grasp.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: One more character approaches, I and you will need to defeat the Akimichi first. Sacrifice one beltpiece, defeat the new character in conclusion.

A moment of time passes before he finally discovers who the new arrival turns out to be:

It&#39;s Yurei, the other Mugen sibling; from what he could gather from sensing the slit eye&#39;d boy&#39;s battle with the rogue bull--he also works with Taijutsu, unknown to what degree however.
An Akimichi and a Taijutsu specialist, however this event will unfurl, it&#39;s best to assume nothing will come swimmingly.
He steels himself, taking action to dash first at Chonamu, regardless of how Yurei acts: he sticks to the plan.
