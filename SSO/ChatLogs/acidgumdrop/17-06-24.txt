<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) smiled at the boy before they looked at the one who arrived and also their current oponent - the plan seemed clear enough. She ran next to Meixun, being by his side step by step. Just as she did however, the girl got a very nice idea.

<font color = white>&#34;Meixun, keep him busy for just one moment - then I&#39;ll give you a chance!&#34;</font>

Fubuki had no time to think of how Yurei could act when he wandered into the fight, but it was best they focus on one enemy at a time regardless.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (actually, meixun next turn can i go first?)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) watched them both basically jump the poor heavy sod.
  <font color = white>&#34;And it goes like this again. . .&#34;</font> He sighed to himself, not too keen on allowing the chubby one to be jumped.

  Yurei had already been teamed up on once and grew a distaste for it in this circumstance. Besides, he was their next target.

   <font color = white>&#34;Hey big guy, when the opening is clear snatch the banner.&#34;</font>

The Mugen pivots into the air, bounces off the wall and then primes himself for to snatch the first streamer on her hip.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) or a snatch on the first streamer on her hip<i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) his opponets were rushing towards him. This made things so much easier.
The Akimichi would lash out with  his left hand in attempt to grab a hold of Meixun. If he was sucesss ful he'd aim to lift them by the front of their shirt and slam them into the ground.

He would then hear Yurei's words and nod his head.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) glanced at her side only to see someone incredibly fast reaching out for her streamer - she just barely managed to avoid it being snatched. It got the better of her however, she knew she wouldn&#39;t last long and instead of trying to defeat her opponent in a futile attempt she opted to go for her original idea.

After the Akimichi&#39;s attack she&#39;d open her arms wide and hug him much like the Meixun did with her earlier. She used everything she had to hopefully keep the Akimichi in place while her teammate attacked.

<font color = white>&#34;Take his streamer before I lose mine! If I go down it&#39;ll be in a blaze of glory!!&#34;</font> she said a bit too dramatically for the current moment.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) took the opportunity of distraction to switch targets. As long as Fubuki has a hold of Chonamu, the Akimichi shouldn't be too grand of an issue... right?
Fubuki's words reached him naturally, though the highest option available was to interrupt Yurei's swiping, because... Well overcoming greater opponents was the name of the game. 

He slipped out of his overcoat the moment Chonamu took ahold of it Meixun's right foot dug into the tiled floor below, allowing him to pivot solidly and make a straight dash for Yurei's person. In a span of a few seconds, the younger Zhu solidly dispels Yurei's hand with his shoulder, stopping the attempt and attempting to vye the youth's attention.

Change of plans, it begins here.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (losing tthe tiles is for when u bodyblock, afterwards u can move i believe)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (so if he alrdy blocked tthen its fine)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (that being said turn order got messy so i also kinda lost track of things)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Yurei(The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) OOCs: (oh ok. the turn of the bodyblock movement is forfeited. just reread)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) thoughtt her plan worked when she surrounded her arms against the Akimichi - but what she wasn&#39;t expecting was how strong her opponent. In a horrible turn of events now she was the one getting hugged. Fubuki chuckled nervously.

<font color = white>&#34;So uh, how about we team u--&#34;</font>

Her eyes widened in terror as he was threatening to fall on top of her. This wasn&#39;t even about the fight anymore, he was threatening to put her in the hospital.

<font color = white>&#34;YOU KNOW YOU CAN&#39;T HURT EACH OTHER RIGHT?!&#34;</font>

It was a miracle as she slipped past him, her body crouched and then turned to the side before being turned into mashed potatoes. Even if the Akimichi was holding back his strength Fubuki was terrified nonetheless.

Then she glanced at what was happening next to her - her teammate got one of his streamers popped. Knowing there was no way to defeat the Akimichi she turned around and also lunged towards Yurei, trying to quickly grab one of his streamers in a most likely futile attempt.

Kicking into a more aggresive gear, the boy fiends for an opening, unrelenting with his strikes despite being on the backfoot of their situation.

<font color = white>&#34;Continuous disproportion...!&#34;</font> He commands Fubuki, just a strange way to say &#39;&#39;keep stalling&#39;&#39; if nothing else.

It was pretty desperate but she ran a bit forward to avoid the lunge and being grabbed, at that moment she realized her opponent might as well be trying to put her in the hospital for real.

<font color = white>&#34;The belt! Go after THE BELT.&#34;</font> she yelled out to her opponent while once more moving her arm towards Yurei&#39;s waist and snatch his banner , perhaps if she got lucky enough she could take one of his banners though she doubted it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) legitimately dropped to the ground and spun on his shoulder with great momentum, kicking up a small debri storm of germs, fecal matter, undried urine, and dirt from shoe rubbers - dodging both their attempts at getting his banner.

   <font color = white>&#34;Ghg, ghg, ghg.&#34;</font> He tensed before trying to kick off the remaining streamer by Meixun&#39;s beltside.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) wasn't focused at all on his remaining streamer before feeling a wiff of air dart into swiping at Yurei. It was Fubuki! She escaped? Wait--who was Yurei targetting in the first place?!

Questions for after the fact, he supposed for now, it's time to swap targets once again. Meixun relents, exiting the conversation of battle for that short moment to designate what exactly Chonamu's next plan would result in. If things came to another rotation--perhaps everyone can get out of this with... One less streamer, if that's still the overarching goal.
His legs push him away just enough for Yurei's attempt to fall short, he huffs slightly. The dilemma was, pretty obvious by now: Fubuki's going to have to lose a streamer for this to work, all he needs to do is hope she can handle what brunt is guaranteed.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) it appeared that his method of imboilizing his targets and just taking both streamers was a bit ineffectivine.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) 
Hana continued to listen to the commanding man, her attention unwavering despite the discomfort gnawing at her. The mechanical timbre of his voice grated against her ears, and the sudden switch to a childlike tone sent a shiver down her spine, amplifying the unease she felt. Every word he spoke heightened the tension, making the entire situation increasingly unsettling for her.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Surely as Shinobi.....there is a manner in which we could chase such a being?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) brought her knuckles to her chin as she observed quietly. Shuye's talents were lacking in this department. She was not particularly observant; she didn't have the uncanny ability to sense the energy in things her brother had, either. Worse, she was barely a genin, physically. No, explosive ordnance disposal was far beyond her capabilities.

She wouldn't have spotted them without another shinobi calling it out.

A traitor to the village, daring to come to the front gates...?

Was Iwagakure so weak?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) approached the scene, her eyes scanning over the crowd carefully before noticing someone outside of the gate-- Of course there was.

A sigh escaped her as she leapt overtop of the students, landing next to Chocho. Turning to face her for a moment, a smile is flashed, followed by a peace sign. She then finally turns her attention onto the stranger at their gates.
 <font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, she called out, looking him over from head to toe.

The camera in his eye was instantly spotted, alerting her to put her guard up. Perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps someone was actually coming to spy on them. Either way, it was work she didn&#39;t plan on having to deal with.
 <font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re just dropping stuff off, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font>, she began, her eyes looming over to the field behind him, noting the vast amount of explosive tags that were placed.

 <font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;know.. Someone has to clean those up, and it isn&#39;t gonna be me!&#34;</font>, she protested, venting another sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever.. If there&#39;s nothing else, then be on your way so I can find someone else to paw- I mean.. Delegate.. This task to...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Would it not trigger a cascade...  A chain reaction of explosions?  Possibly taking out the cliff, gate and part of the wall or nore?

However....if one of those explosive tags detonated....o-ow... SHe just let her peer handel the talking...after all..she was off duty at the moment!</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: It ain't science.  It's fact that if a tag explodes close enough to another, it'll trigger it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was susceptible to the explosions that had gone off unless he was saved by an awesome pair of shinobi. He covers his face, preparing for the worst.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) was probably safe, way up there on the village wall.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) The explosion erupted suddenly, sending debris and a powerful shockwave. Kohana was tossed to the side, hitting the ground hard and feeling the impact through her body.

As she lay there, trying to catch her breath, doubts began to creep into her mind. Was she really built for this shinobi life?

Unless saved by the Chunin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would of course!...try her best to...block all the explosions!...by explanding her body and body blocking the exterance of the gaze!

She was now...super big...one arm went to the one arm went to the right. It was more to stop the shockwave from reaching them...taking on all of the force!

HOwever...as the smoke settled..she noticed that the commanding man was gone...high into the wind...maybe feelings..unfounded..mm..un found....she then waved her hand to clear the smoke residue...as she watched their now broken stair case...probably covered in crystals...

[Aimed to protect those closest and behind her with multisize body block!]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) vents a <i>massive</i> sigh as the explosive tags begin to detonate outwards in. Perhaps it was time for her to actually take this situation seriously.

 <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s like.. The uncoolest thing you could&#39;ve done, random dude.&#34;</font>, she protested. Her hands came together, weaving through a flurry of seals.

With a clap of her hands, the Shingen musters all of her Chakra into the air above the tags. <font color = white>&#34;Doton: Otoshibuta!&#34;</font>

From out of thin air, a massive lid forms, hovering over the field in front of the group. The surrounding area was of no concern to her, the wall was far too sturdy for any amount of explosive tags to take it down.. To an extent.

The shadow that loomed over all present only lingered for a moment before beginning to shrink at a rapid rate. Anyone who&#39;d not yet realized a giant lid spawned in the air would quickly notice as it began crashing down towards the ground, sealing in the impending explosion.
 <font color = white>&#34;Man.. One of these days I&#39;m gonna need to get paid more... This is getting ridiculous..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I'm still deciding on you lot, but that guy definitely didn't pass.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: What is a vibe?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: It's something I have.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: phew
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Did you see his body though...  THat was...  Strange.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Yea. He sounded mechnical...Then like a child. All in one breath.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. His movements seemed a bit... mechanical.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nods in response. <font color = white>&#34;Looked like he was built, or rebuilt maybe.&#34;</font>

She shrugs. <font color = white>&#34;Who cares. He didn&#39;t look all that strong.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches in awe as his superiors demonstrate some pretty awesome techniques. Picking his jaw up off the floor he shouts. Interjecting in the conversation about a supposedly weird body the messenger had.

<font color = white>&#34;That was awesome Koume! Kitsumi! Can you teach us how to do that?! I mean- Obviously not the body thing. But the giant lid thing?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wouldn't be surprised if he were rigged to explode as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) arrives at the gate a few deep breaths could be heard. <font color = white>&#34;Whats going on ??&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would place her hands on her hips not shinking for a moment to watch what was happening south of her from a birds eye view.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) felt alot of body heat behind him. He looks behind him and a massive fat man stood there.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: He didn't do something to the guards patrolling the wall and guarding the gate, did he?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) shrugs.
 <font color = white>&#34;Dunno, but I know it&#39;s not my fault!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) wasn't expecting Katora to be so strong when it came to striking speed. Much faster than she'd witnessed prior to this. Nevertheless, Chonamu seemed to be able to hold his own to a degree. Her slow approach continued. The way things were going she figured Chonamu would be defeated and Katora would then make quick work of her afterwards.

She pressed on.</font></font></font>

     A palm became a stone splitting the rushing river that was the kid&#39;s Brutish Hand. Harmlessly smacking them in the wrist to divert the trajectory of their grab. Those fingers of theirs merely close around empty air. 

In turn? He drives a speedy jab directly for the kid&#39;s sternum.
<font color = white>&#34;Not bad. I can tell you hit decent hard.&#34;</font>
Compliments paid where they were due, while he side steps a tad. Keeping both of his enemies within sight.

But it was clear she most likely would in a moment or two just out of sheer boredom at this rate.

But. Haste makes waste. He&#39;s not liking the sound of the Akimichi&#39;s latest utterance. It almost sounds as if they have a plan. And, well, he&#39;s already scored one hit upon them, even if it was by accident...

Hm. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got something fun planned too.&#34;</font>

He answered, while he skips out of grabbing-reach and slices the edge of his hand for the guy&#39;s Ribbon! Intent on shearing it clean in half, flimsy as the material was.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) snickered softly. <font color = white>&#34;Well I did think you could hold out for a little while longer, but I suppose I couldn&#39;t beat him on my own.&#34;</font> with this, the Uchiha took a breath before rushing forward to finally join the fray. Admittedly with her impressively slow speed it&#39;d take her a moment still before she would be able to get into the mix.

But given just how nimble Katora was, winning wasn&#39;t likely an option. She&#39;d take a moment to survey just how many ribbons Chonamu had. She&#39;d now be standing firmly face to face with each of them. But who would she target first?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) never underestimated an enemy. 
      Overestimation was key. Despite not showcasing such thus far, he suspected the Uchiha might be capable of clearing the distance to him in one stride, which would spell trouble if they saved such like a Trump Card. 

Therefore...
     As the latest heavy-weight hammer of a punch came for him? The Fuma Student dared to dash CLOSER! Yes, he darts into their guard, slanting out the way of that devastating STRAIGHT! It doesn&#39;t even clip him as he, quite literally, ran two steps up their torso. 

Chakra Adhesion of the Wall Walking technique made such tactics possible. He used them as a human springboard, pushing off his second step into a full moonsault, gone flying backwards. He landed on his feet and used the momentum to skip himself even farther. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve spent a good amount of time observing while we&#39;ve tired each other out... so I think I&#39;ve earned a breather.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll have to think of a way to take him out in a single move, together.&#34;</font> she stated to Chonamu.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) enjoyed his vacation in the meantime. A casual stroll&#39;s taken.
<font color = white>&#34;Mm? No rules against using chakra, my friend. We are only unable to use weapons.&#34;</font> 

Honestly. That no-throwing weapon rule crippled him the most! But, he would not complain.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong, Reilin. Unless... you&#39;re hiding some serious talent at Taijutsu? I&#39;ve yet to see you throw a punch. That&#39;s dangerous.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Well, my plan was to let Chonamu take a bit of damage while he wittled away at your defenses to a point where he and I could take you out in one shot.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I did have it planned out, though. You were just too crafty as well
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. We'll wait for my twin to give us the details.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had been spaced out staring at the water and didn&#39;t realize Shuye approached him. Spacing back in he spins around to continue talking to her without being rude.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, with they&#39;d actually ever come though. They&#39;re like several bajillion ryo...&#34;</font>

He then looks to Fubuki and shrugs,

<font color = white>&#34;I just wanted to buy something shiny to be honest.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. Well, I'm only five hundred ryo short for a katana, thanks to Hana.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) ears quirk up at the sound of &#39;buy something shiny&#39;.

With a overdramatic backflip from the arena, she lands next to the red-haired boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Well let me show you my wares!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed.

Her hands came together, a loud clap echoing out, before she withdraws her hands apart towards either side of her. As her hands stretched out, shimmering pink crystals formed, making unique patterns along the way until she&#39;d finally reached as far as she could.
 <font color = white>&#34;Just fifty Ryo and I&#39;ll make a shiny object of your choice!&#34;</font>

Was she attempting to scam children? Yes. Did she care? Absolutely not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) is a little too wise-- or perhaps, more accurately, a little too jaded, to fall for this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) sloooowly turns to face Kitsumi. Clearly not having forgotten how quick she was to pawn the work of repairing the gate and stairs off on literally anyone else. His eyes narrow, staring at her for a moment. However he&#39;s immediately distracted by the crystals. His brain was smooth and the rocks were pretty.

<font color = white>&#34;A shiny object of my choice?! Out of crystal right? That&#39;d be awesome...&#34;</font>

He cups his chin in his hand and begins pondering what to ask for. Eventually snapping his fingers and holding out fifty ryo to the Shingen.

<font color = white>&#34;I want a crystal monkey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: What's the point of having money if I don't spend it- Shuye are you suggesting I'm a monkey?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But you're always complaining about money, maybe save a little first...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) scowled externally, and smiled internally. Silence and eye contact is the answer.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm not *complaining* about money! I just *want* money. There's a difference!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. I guess then, fair enough.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And I want money so that I can spend it! Spending money makes me feel better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) continued flipping through his book.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What do you want to spend it on though? Just anything?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean, anything that's cool yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Liiiike a crystal monkey!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Should have got a rock-candy monkey.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I don't think she can make rock-candy... But that does sound awesome!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) gave a nod in response before clasping her hands together once again. All the crystals she&#39;d formed turned into nothing but sparkles in the air as her hands met.
 <font color = white>&#34;Of course!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed once again, the prospect of profit clearly warranting more energy out of the normally aloof girl.

As her hands began pulling apart, a Curious George-esque monkey formed within her palms, shimmering against the sunlight. Little by little it came together, its slightly larger than body head forming first, followed by its body and limbs, until finally she added a little curved tail at the end.

Extending her hand out, she offered the piece to the boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now, my crystals are resistant to near everything in such compact form, so breaking it should be hard!... UnlessIdiebutthenwe&#39;reallscrewed.&#34;</font>, she finished with a bright smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) &#39;s eyes light up as Kitsumi begins. Watching with awe as the little paperweight takes shape. Mumbling to no one in particular as she works,

<font color = white>&#34;Maaan manipulating crystals is so cool...&#34;</font>

Taking the monkey, he holds it up toward the sun. Turning it around in the air and simply looking at the sparkles.

<font color = white>&#34;This is awesome!&#34;</font>

Then his ears perk up at the claim of it being extremely durable. A clear mental battle is fought as he resists the urge to drop it or rap a knuckle against it to test her claim. For a moment he wonder if she was actualyl lying and the complete opposite was true-

What if this thing was super fragile!

He carefully lowers it, now holding it in both hands. He nods to Kitsumi and says,

<font color = white>&#34;This is super cool. Thank you Kitsumi. Worth fifty ryo...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Of course! I'm available from nine-to-five on weekdays.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Maybe! And I can make mostly anything! The larger it is, the less durable it is, though!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Im pretty sure you dont need the money Kitsumi, boy Its Sensei Kitsumi to you. It's like you dont have any good upbringing.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat... I totally need the Ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Feel free to hit him over the head, Kitsumi.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Well.. If you're learning Doton or Shurikenjutsu, I'm your girl! If it's anything else, I'm clueless!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) reaches out and bonks the child over the head.

No missed opportunities to bully children.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately drops down. Squatting and moving to hold a hand against the spot he&#39;d been hit. Sucking air through his teeth as he mumbles,

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhhtatatata...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: This is a fight you cannot win.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-Not another one...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Lucky it was Kitsumi who hit you and not me.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: I am rather noodle-army!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I bet you hit like an old man these days...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Silently positioned by a tree, observing others present with a tired demeanor, the reticent young boy made use of a small mirror to peer into the deepening bags under his eyes.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) asks: Old man?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Just throw yourself in the moat.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He's dead.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I wonder if I could crystalize the whole moat with you guys in it...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead its much better than the lump thats about to form on your head.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Jump in the moat for me right quick...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Can I take off my clothes first?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Soggy socks are the worst...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uh... That's up to your dad not me. You might catch a cold, or something I'dunno.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: . . . .
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'll hold the monkey for you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Thank you Shuye.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) looked like a wreck, with the sun looming over Iwagakure, blinding the child. It's easy to assume that the child doesn't get out much. Blinking twice in a slow manner, the pocket mirror is placed away into a pouch as the 5'3 child continues to watch the proceedings of those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) flickered towards his son, kicking up a gentle waft of dust, before kicking him into the water with a sideways kick.

<font color = white>&#34;Just get in the water you bastard&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) was in the process of holding out the crystalline monkey to Shuye as he&#39;s kicked in the chest. A pathetic grunt is shouted out as he is sent straight into the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Guh!&#34;</font>

Unfortunately he was a big kid and his clothes were now soaked. So rather than simply swim back to edge like a normal person; he flailed around helplessly for a few seconds. Splashing water everywhere and toward all those nearby. Before eventually realizing the moat wasn&#39;t very deep.

And remembering that he could walk on water. With a sigh he plants his hands on the surface of the water and pulls himself up and out. Shaking in place like a dog, trying to get rid of at least some of the water. Which, was almost entirely futile.

Grumbling to himself he returns to his spot and glares at his father.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to call me a bastard too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) asks: Hey, Mugen. On a scale of one-to-ten, how cool do you think a crystal statue of him would be?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Is there a Negative? option.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I can't believe you'd say that about your eldest son...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Your only son!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Whats tewelve more years, make another one. Start again.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Y-You wouldn't...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: We can seal him away, Mugen.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Just say the word...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Please don't...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) The boy was gone before she could blink. Before the wind hit the back of her kimono from the man's movement. He was in the water before the surface tension broke and bubbled. But still, Shuye had her hands out, and managed to catch the monkey before it fell to the ground. Would it have shattered? Probably not. But they didn't need to know.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) smiles brightly as she holds up a single seal. In that very moment, the ground beneath Hideo would begin to crystalize, slowly crawling up his legs.

Well, slowly to her. To him? It was a near instant encapsulation!

As it finally reached up to his neck, she stopped the crystals and turned to Mugen.
 <font color = white>&#34;Tada!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) sips the moat water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) looks down at the crystals growing beneath him. Quickly looking toward Kitsumi he shout,

<font color = white>&#34;No! Release me! I command y-&#34;</font>

Before being cut off and entombed in a gemstone prison. His smooth brain now perfectly immoratlized in crystaline form.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Blankly staring at the iron vessel and the pale-skinned girl, the child only had the energy to blink in a lazy manner, with cruelty on full display. Getting involved might result in their scandalous activities being directed towards him after all.

As crystals crept up Hideo's frame, the reticent young boy confirmed their insanity, taking solace in the natural concealment offered by the bark of the rather large tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The lumberjack, jack-Kristuria) begins to tirelessly swing a large axe at the tree before him. He didn't have a permit and this was illegal.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) taps the frozen statue of his son, with a finger tentatively, considering how long he should leave him like that.
<font color = white>&#34;He can breath in there right&#34;</font>?,he asked dispite enjoying tormenting the lad, he was his father after all.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uhm...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Probably not!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) retracts the crystals just enough to free his nose.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now he can!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Ah good.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately inhales sharply. His nostrils flaring as he breathes. And, while he couldn't move his jaw, he could shit spew a stream of expletives. Granted the sound comes out of his nose as a garbled grunt that was completely incomprehensible. But it made him feel better.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: I think he likes it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: AHOUKINGAOLESEEIEOU!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: ELEASEEIOMMANDI!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa Guard (The masked guard-ChainsOfMadness) turns off as he begins glancing around, it would’ve been a lie if he said he’d seen the young boy integrate himself.

With a quiet sigh, he barks to the reticent young boy. <font color = white>&#34;Come on, we didn’t travel all the way from Akhibara just for you to shy away. Meet your peers, make some friends, you’re back home now.&#34;</font>

He approaches the boy hiding behind the tree, mostly obscured. The man had very excellent hearing though, and could tell just who was behind there. <font color = white>&#34;Don’t be afraid of them&#34;</font> he says aloud whilst thinking &#39;they should probably be afraid of you&#39;

He motions forward, <font color = white>&#34;come on, Hitoshi. You’ll need to make friends so we can get you a proper squad after graduation&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I didn't expect that from you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked at the two toned headed youth, withaa puzzled expression. He wanted to torture people? The jounin simply shook his head and returned his attention towards his crystalized son.

<font color = white>&#34;Well did you learn your lesson&#34;</font>?,he asked with a smirk on his face, awaiting the boys response.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: So... should I...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Put the monkey down...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) held it awkwardly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: It's not mine.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Released dread into the atmosphere, metaphorically dampening the air with its mere presence alone. The tired, cold eyes of the hiding boy peered from around the bark. They had become engaged with the Iwa guards. How did the guard ever surmise that the reticent boy happened to be positioned behind the tree?

Shifting a defeated and exhausted gaze to the floor, a steady flow of air is sucked through the hiding one's nostrils. Coming out from behind the tree, the 5'3 boy became more visible, appearing to be frail dressed in comfy clothes and sporting unkempt hair.

No words were offered to the Iwagakure guard, even if the child obliged their request.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: OIinoearnmesson. Ourolansmea. Sueleaseumoneyown.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks behind him and would see a kid hiding behind a tree; assuming he was shy and hearing what the Iwa Gaurd he&#39;d think about introducing himself and saying hI to the other kid.

Getting up from where he was sitting he&#39;d walk towards the other kid, Kuro was scratching his face a bit while looking at the other kid. <font color = white>&#34;hey that tree doesn&#39;t give much cover, you should try a wall.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say before laughing a bit trying to be funny and trying to lighten things up. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kuro, and you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) could only continue to aggressively mumble through his nose in response to his father and Shuye.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked towards the scowling red eye girl. 
<font color = white>&#34;Monkey&#34;</font>?,he asked her with a tilt of his head, rasing his fist and cracking open the crystal prison which held his son captive.

<font color = white>&#34;Where did you get a monkey lassie&#34;</font>?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) says: Damn.. I heard a rumor some guy got encased in crystal..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was indeed holding a crystal monkey. It wasn&#39;t that big, but it wasn&#39;t small either. She looked to the pale-skinned girl, then at her victim and the man&#39;s son.

<font color = white>&#34;Hideo bought it from her.&#34;</font> She answered, matter-of-factly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) blinks awkwardly as Mugen&#39;s hand slams against her Crystal.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) continues shouting through his nose. Now, clearly laughing, as his father's hand hits the crystal and fails to break it. Granted the laughing sounds more like a struggling wheeze as his chest couldn't really move to breathe enough to properly laugh.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa Guard (The masked guard-ChainsOfMadness) looks at the young boy with a smile, though it wouldn’t be seen behind the mask

<font color = white>&#34;Much better, I’ve got some duties to run but you be good now. And no…losing control ya?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) releases the poor boy from his crystal prison. A smile present on her face as she did.
 <font color = white>&#34;Did you have fun?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) loudly gasps as if he hadn&#39;t been able to breathe for the past few minutes. Given that his chest couldn&#39;t actually expand at all his breathing had been really shallow. But now he was free!

He leans forward, planting his hands on his knees as he pants for a few moments. Shaking his head and mumbling,

<font color = white>&#34;That totally sucked...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (and they said shingen aint shit fr

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Squinting as sunlight once again harasses his irises, Hitoshi's vision returns and he is met by a boy with one eye covered. As the fellow approaches, they are met with a gaze capable of piercing the soul directly. Kuro ridiculed the reticent one's stealth capability. Unsure of what to do now, the young, frail boy contemplated fleeing.

It's true, to be an exemplary shinobi required a squad, alongside the respect and admiration of fellow Iwagakurens. With a chilling silence, all that's offered is a nod. It's one of acknowledgment.

Kuro and Hitoshi were now best friends.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) having finally caught his breath, he holds out his hand towards Shuye.

<font color = white>&#34;Ignore my dad! Thanks for holding the monkey Shuye.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) continued to wait  to hear the other kid speak, but he didn&#39;t speak only nodding his head. Kuro would assume that he just didn&#39;t like talking and just left it at just that. <font color = white>&#34;Not much of a talker I guess, thats fine I can do enough talking for the both of us.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d say as he would get a little bit closer before looking back at the gaurd. <font color = white>&#34;Hey mr Gaurd do you know his name? I don&#39;t think hes much of a talker.&#34;</font> he would say to the gaurd.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) felt ramping anxiety and building tension towards more physical violence. Shuye is paralyzed.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Hideo, if that monkey is returned to you. I will ask Kitsumi to seal you up again.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: I could give it to my little sister, Hideo?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanaka, Ashimiya(The teenager-Dbz563187) OOCs: (hw 2 get moni)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Maaaaan....
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Helloooo.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Do whatever you want with it Shuye... Hey Tsuneko.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fuma, Katora(The blond lad-Iodized Salt) OOCs: [pray someone will bless you tbh]
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: How cute/
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Forced to smile, Kuro met with yellow-stained teeth and dead eyes followed by an illuminated grin. Stepping closer, that smile faded. If Kuro is now the voice for both of them, Hitoshi would have faith.

Blinking once at Kuro, the frail boy extended a hand, attempting to gently tug on Kuro's sleeve.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) pocketed the crystal monkey, somehow.

<font color = white>&#34;It shouldn&#39;t have ended up this way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: The world is a cruel place...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Have you tried fixing your karma?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kamei, Hitoshi(The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) OOCs: (Kuro is met*)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm gonna change my karma for the better... I'm destined for greatness!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True. Great things come to those who do great works. 
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If your luck isn't good, you're literally not destined for greatness.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: In that case you have to go against your fate.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Speaking of great works. How did you do in that brawl?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Quiet Fubuki! I will go against my fate! I'm just that cool- Oh I lost Katora. But I snagged a flag before going down.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: I...I told you to go against your fate you dumbass!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanaka, Ashimiya(The teenager-Dbz563187) OOCs: (gah)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah! I will!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Okay, good.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: But not because you told me to! I was already going to! 
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Not bad. It could be worse. I heard rumors some goofy bunch had a free for all in the girl's washroom of all places.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Well I don't care just do it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I will!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh, yeah that was me.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Chin up. Be glad you weren't them.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Really? The girls bathroom was a fight spot too?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, I found a boy there and he wanted to fight so we fought.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Me Gosu and Yurei fought in the boys bathroom. What're the odds...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) didn&#39;t do anything while the shy kid was tugging on his sleeves, only looking at him curiously.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah what happened?&#34;</font> He asked questioningly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Then entered an Akimichi, then Yurei.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: We fought for so long we couldn't end our fight before the alarm bell rang, so we just dropped it.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Interesting....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Laaaame, you didn't even finish?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wanted to but there was an emergency going on.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh yeah the explosions and the weird guy at the gate.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You would not have beaten Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair. As for me... I just stood in one place and fought whoever dared to try me.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Did you end up winning Katora?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Right in the middle of the hall. In plain sight.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Meixun and I couldn't beat each other so we teamed up against other people.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Nice, congrats man!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Didn't lose a single ribbon.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I lost no ribbons either.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) The frail  boy is now exceptionally close to Kuro, close enough for the other kid to pick up the powerful scent of coffee. He raises a single thin finger, pointing it towards the larger group. At this point, the reticent young boy's stomach is turning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A pity we didn't get to fight. If I recall? You handled the game pretty well too, Tsuneko.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah I bet having six arms is a pretty cool advantage.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: Yeah theres people over there.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: haven't really talked to any of them though.
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: ......
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I would have lost for sure, if you decided to gang up on me with Reilin.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: the redhead looks intimidating though...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hideo, just so you know I was hunting for you. But alas.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) nodded, kuro has a good head on him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You were? Ha, I knew you liked me.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You're literally a brat.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: How dare you. I am the total opposite! And am, in fact, super cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Peaked around Kuro only to see all of them standing idle, there's a feeling of unapproachability.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Right, the kid who gets bullied by his father constantly.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wouldn't a brat be spoiled? I'm literally the opposite of spoiled...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It must be what they call a 'tough love' parenting style. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: My dad literally just gave away something I bought with my own money!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm destitute even!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Not necessarily spoiled. Maybe rat fits better though.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It's only fair. You probably owe him like fifty-thousand ryo for all the clothes and food he gave you until now.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I don't owe him a debt for being his son!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You're in debt, Hideo. I'm sorry to break it to you like this.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah you're fifty thousand into debt, you're fucked.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-No way...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I don't even have fifty ryo anymore...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You spent your last fifty ryo on a crystal monkey.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yes, yes I did.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just do the obstacle course ten thousand times.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Only for it to end up with a girl you're not even friends with. Life is cruel,...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: W-We're totally friends Shuye...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It'll all work out. Just got to work one-thousand times harder.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm already working a million times harder than most of you! What do you mean another thousand times?!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: But if it's what I have to do... I'll push past my limits!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks at the group and back at The reticent young boy; he noticed that he would constintly look at the group but wouldn&#39;t actually go towards them.

<font color = white>&#34;we&#39;ll have to talk to them eventually, they are around our age, we&#39;ll probably see them around from time to time.&#34;</font>

Turning back to face the group he&#39;d attempt to grab at the kids sleeve inorder to bring him along.

<font color = white>&#34;we should go say hello.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm working one-thousand and two times harder, sucks to suck man.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) quirked a brow at Hideo.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh... okay, if you want to be friends, okay then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah well your forehead is big is Fubu- Oh cool, sounds good to me Shuye.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Not as big as your dents.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Take that back right now...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nope.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Hideoo has dents?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: The dents aren't even something I can control!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: One thousand times the forehead space versus one thousand times the skull dents. Who will win?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I will, Katora!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: What's with my forehead now?!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nothing's wrong with your forehead Fubuki.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: It's a nice forehead.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Thanks, very cool.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Perhaps you could rent advertising space on your forehead.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Dude. I do need five hundred ryo though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fubuki, the billboard of Iwagakure...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: In this economy? Not a bad option.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24)  soft silk sweater is grabbed by Kuro as he successfully manages to steal away Hitoshi to pursue the frivolous endeavor of meeting new friends. Stricken by anxiety and a shred of embarrassment, the reticent boy doesn't offer a verbal objection.

So he must be fine with it!
 Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I mean we're all broke, I don't think it's that humiliating. Anything for a Katana...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kamei, Hitoshi(The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) OOCs: (A soft silk sweater*)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Nothing humiliating about it. Do what you gotta do!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, no one will be laughing after I bonk them with a sword.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Very true.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: You could-- uhm, maybe find a job at the ramen stand? Or the tea shop?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) Kuro would take the boy and would run towards the group pulling the boy behind him, after a few seconds they were next to the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, I&#39;m Kuro and me and my friend just wanted to say hello to you all.&#34;</font> He said before looking at his new friend.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: They might like that you're so-- uhh, tall.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I mean. not tall..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I need to make more friends too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I 'unno, I think I'm still too young for a job.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Except...we can become shinobi as kids...huh.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Jobs are good...  Ramen...  Mmm.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Fubuki do you make sammishes?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Don't think about it too hard Fubuki. I certainly don't.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Er, sammiches.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) nearly tripped during the approach to the group present. F, forcing his head down for a brief second before looking back up ato the crowd.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) leans forward and waves to Kuro and the boy beside him.

<font color = white>&#34;Hi! I&#39;m Utsuwa Hideo, nice to meet you both!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Er.  Sandwiches.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks to Kuro and his friend, waving for a moment with a light smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You're the second person to ask me for a sandwich. The first one was a cunt.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: A what now?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But you seem nice so sure I wouldn't mind making one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) is only capable of granting a chilling silence. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) hummed, suddenly hungry.

<font color = white>&#34;Food...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) placed his attention on the duo delivering a greeting to the masses. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. I&#39;m Katora. Fuma Clan.&#34;</font>
His introduction is accompanied by a lazy lift of hand. Barely a wave before his arm fell slack at his side.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) asks: o-oh?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Do you have snacks, sensei?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) waved at the duo once they showed up, she was looking kinda mad thinking about whether her forehead was too big or not.

<font color = white>&#34;Sup Kuro and his friend, I&#39;m Fubuki.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: i...
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: Its nice to meet you too, Katora, Fubuki, Hideo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) reaching into her judo kimono..she slowly pulled out!...

a chocolate bar..and..a couple of bags of chips</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [hmm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked at the snacks, then at Choko.

Were they for sharing? Probably not...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Managed to catch the blonde lad's lazy hand lift with his peripherals. It's then, after Fubuki introduces herself, an angry aura puts the reticent young boy on guard in an instant.

Not knowing how to respond, the frail one peered to Kuro. 
He took the words right out of Hitoshi's mouth.

With an unintentional head bop, Kuro's newfound friend reveals a bag of ground coffee beans. Scooping a couple right into his mouth, the reticent young boy continued to stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Shingen, Kitsumi has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would slightly distracted for a moment as the had a new obstical course idea in mind...

But her motions continued to hold up the chocolate bar for them to take and a bag of chips!

As for what brand of choclate it was..she began to speak..as she held it out first.

<font color = white>&#34;chocolate and love..hearts entwin..sweetness divine...aroma..of coca fine..mhm&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;however its slightly bitter..it also contrasts with sweetness...a delecate balance mm...oddly..of true innocense and bliss..&#34;</font>

The brand of the chocolate bar..red Fujiya. <font color = white>&#34;mm..s-sorry..it came to mind mhm dont worry i wont go on a monologe about chips now..&#34;</font> A light akward laughter was later given mhm..as she hold it out for them to take there after!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) took the chocolate bar!

She didn&#39;t seem to mind the sweetness of the chocolate, or the bitterness of the cocoa that flavored it. <font color = white>&#34;What does that word mean?&#34;</font> She asked, pointing to Fujiya on the wrapper as she munched.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: m-mm..good question..if i remeber correctly..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks over to the other boy and sees him cugging down scoops of ground coffee down his mouth. <font color = white>&#34;huh you must really love ground coffee, must taste reall good for you to down it like that.&#34;</font> He said to the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;hey if you like it who am I to judge, might want to slow down though.&#34;</font> he said to the boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) reaching into her pocket, she took out a piece of paper.

<font color = white>&#34;hmm..a-ah..its a word..that is an extention of Fujiyama..which translates to..volcano..or volcano mountain....which is rather smart..since our headband..is a rock....&#34;</font>

She paused as she found her next answer

<font color = white>&#34;t-though...i didnt know..they thought that deep when..about it..mm it it might be another one of the shogans words..oh..branding....&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) was of sharp visual acuity. The Silent One&#39;s abnormal choice of snack does not evade his sight. And yet. He only finds it in him to stare, rather than question the whys. It&#39;s rude to point out oddities in others, says his sense of decency. Besides. Someone else did it for him. 

No answer came. A mute? Maybe.

In the meantime?
<font color = white>&#34;So.. you didn&#39;t win your brawl. But. Did you lose any ribbons?&#34;</font>
He asked the lavendar-haired Swordswoman in Training over there a question.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Nah, but it&#39;s all thanks to Meixun. He sacrificed one of his ribbons for mine. That being said, did you lose any ribbons?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a shake of head.
<font color = white>&#34;Not a single one.&#34;</font>

A moment is spent holding his chin in thought before he asks something more. 

<font color = white>&#34;You went with the squading-up strategy? I would have placed money on you going solo. Or did they decide to become your follower and support your climb to the top?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would find herself thikning for a moment before the sturned to leave the area.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shaked her head at all of those.

<font color = white>&#34;I was going solo at first, looking for Hideo to kick his ass. Shame he was on the one place I couldn&#39;t go...anyways, Meixun and I were in a stalemate &#39;cuz we couldn&#39;t get each other&#39;s banners so we teammed up against the ones who were gonna team up on us. It was pretty cool.&#34;</font>

Then she looked at Katora, squinting her eyes a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;Why do I get the feeling you just waited until everybody else eliminated each other?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed the faintest muffled laugh.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m nowhere near that conniving.&#34;</font>

Out of habit, he plucked a kunai from his holster and spins it like a propeller on his index finger, just to keep them occupied. 

<font color = white>&#34;All my encounters were left to fate. I stood out in the open and waited for my enemies to fine me. Granted... I did have extra insurance set up. In the form of a Kawarimi. If you go hunting? You lose the advantage of preparation time. But. No one ever managed to land a clean hit on me, so I didn&#39;t get to use those measures.&#34;</font> 

He gave a shrug.
<font color = white>&#34;I fought twice back to back. One on ones. And then? The final free for all here in the arena.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) let out an exascerbated sigh, looking at his clothing for a few moments. He still wasn't well versed enough to trot upon water just yet, so he'll need to settle with more.... Improvisational practices.

He formulates a few seals he remembered from a scroll read, then he lifted his undershirt, folding the linen neatly into a triangular plate before creasing each edge with both hands. Undoing the metallic string that held his tailed hair in the back--his hair's apparently getting longer--he wraps it around the congruent angle's point, folding that down to support the shape.

All of this was to make some sort of makeshift throwing item, to which the boy flexes his quads to toss off to the other side! Unfortunately for his aim, he ends up hitting Kitusmi, having said item dangle to the ground unceremoniously. Though there wasn't much of any time to react to that, he mosies over toward Fubuki, poking her before hissing a whisper.</font></font></font>

As Meixun got closer he'd hear a very small snore coming from Fubuki, she was standing still and not moving except for her breathing. The boy's poke however woke her up and immediately she looked kinda around, confused and unaware of what was going on. It took her a moment to realize Meixun wanted to talk to her, so she lowered herself to hear him better. The girl thought about what the boy said before whispering something back.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Kay, ready?&#34;</font>

And right after, without waiting for his approval, she&#39;d karate chop his head - it was just lightly hitting his head, not causing any actual damage.

He repeated his little noise dramatically as if the strike did any true damage, dissolving his will to stand.

The razors on his eyelids dig into his browline as he patters down with a divalike splash, seemingly unmoving for a while.

She was really tired today after being tortured and traveling to another village. But the sudden loud noise of a splash woke her up in confusion, which woke up Fubuki again. Once more she looked around and realized...Meixun must&#39;ve done a technique!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, so you wanted to show me this r--&#34;</font>

She looked down and saw the boy on the water, simply floating. Not moving. At all.

<font color = white>&#34;MEIXUN?!&#34;</font>

Fubuki went down to grab him in a hurry, desperately trying to pull him up...she thought she had killed him. Even though she was older, the girl wasn&#39;t that strong physically. All she ended up doing was falling towards the pool of water as well, right next to Meixun.</font></font></font>

He looked at his ruined undershirt, realizing that he&#39;s just soaked one of his favorite clothes for a shinobi technique.... A frown pinched on his lips before he turned over to Shuye, <font color = white>&#34;Daole shenme daole shenme?&#34;</font> He chanted eagerly.

It&#39;s been a while since either of the Zhu siblings brought up their youngest sister, so whatever the eldest got must&#39;ve been very sentimental.

<font color = white>&#34;M-Meixun? I didn&#39;t hit you that hard did I- AHHHH!&#34;</font>

Fubuki was startled by Meixun&#39;s chanting, who had made it to the other side -- it was like seeing a ghost. Then she blinked twice. Ohhh, Kawarimi, right. Fubuki slowly got up and sighed, now all her clothes were wet - great.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah you&#39;re...uh, you&#39;re welcome...&#34;</font> she sighed while sitting on the floor. Atleast she did help him, technically.</font></font></font>
