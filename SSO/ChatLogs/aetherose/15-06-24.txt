<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) wanders into what should be described as a square of sorts.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey.&#34;</font> He greeted the group already there before moving his hands into his pockets.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckled once more as more and more people came to be around.
<font color = white>&#34;Hello, everyone. Nice to see more people around again.
I wonder, though, if the Hyuuga Clan Head will be around, soon, as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) is found staring at the sky, arms across his chest. The voice of the approaching boy snaps him to attention. <font color = white>&#34;Oh... hey.&#34;</font> 
He then looks to the stranger girl. <font color = white>&#34;Why, is there some sort of special occasion?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He gives the scrolls.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) shakes her head slowly, yet her smile would not fade.
Instead, her eyes would scan the two recently arrived.

A green-haired individual, and a black-haired one.
The Green-haired one seemed taller, more mature than herself, or even more-so than the other person.

As for the black-haired one, they seemed feminine, at least, to her.
<font color = white>&#34;Nothing too big should be happening, unless the Festival of Water has begun - But I think it has yet to begin... I believe. As for other activities, it would be the academy.&#34;</font>

The girl moved a hand through her hair before continuing.
<font color = white>&#34;Are you both students as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (hanamura,where did you got that profile code?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (A friend. ^^ Why?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i might need it XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (wondering if it will prevent that discord annoyance of changing their link every couple of days
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) turned to his side, looking at the green-haired male before looking around some more, noticing the shark-boy as well.
He'd raise his hand in greeting towards them, a light smirk visable, before he'd listen to the girl some more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded his head, taking a bit of time to read the soft spoken person on the bench. He took note of the courteous smile, which caused him to stare for a bit too long, but then he quickly averted his gaze once their gazes met. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (The profile sadly won't accept Discord Pictures, hence why my first playby failed. But it should work with other sites' pictures, I think.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) got up from her seat, taking a position more centered on the group, rather than sticking to one side of it.
<font color = white>&#34;I do assume you&#39;re both students, as well? What about you?&#34;</font> She&#39;d ask, looking over to the Shark-like boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (not only images but mp3 files too 
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mmmm-hm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well...is nice to finally see more people.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I'm a student, yes. Yuki, Subaru. Pleasure.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...oh,explains your
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Feminine look
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) offered a nod in confirmation towards the lass, shifting his form to avoid a particularly annoying beam of sunlight breaking through the tree-leaves.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Nice to meet you too, Subaru. I am Hanamura.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked around, taking note of everyone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kusahara. Student.&#34;</font> He said briefly, but with a bit more volume in his voice this time so everyone could hear.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well Hanamura,is seems we found out  other students.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That's correct, yes. And I do hope more will come, as well. Even so, I am pleased to see more and more are waking up.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Either way, nice to meet you, as well, Kusahara.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded in response. <font color = white>&#34;And you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) let out a sharp wan, reclining back somewhat, the pale-skinned individual almost threatening to fall back onto the ground from his seated position. 
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, right. Introductions, uh... Hello. I&#39;m Saigosame. Of the Hoshigaki clan. Just, you know, in case there was any doubt.&#34;</font>, he remarked, following with a brief chuckle at his own joke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Might I ask, have either of you decided on a goal or focus, yet? For myself, I like to train in Ninjutsu and Taijutsu. But I am also still open for learning other paths, of course. - And pleasure to meet you, Saigosame, as well.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nice to meet you all. Good to see a Hoshigaki about, and glad my eyes didn't fool me, heheh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) scratches the back of his head, smirking lightly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank stare to the question stated, looking back up at the sky to find some sort of sign or answer, finding none. In the end he just shrugged, looking at the others and listening to their answers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Ah, sorry, as far your question...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) yells: I suppose Ninjutsu, yes. Maybe some additions for self-defense in close-combat could be great!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: We have one blacksmith and one future medic besides her
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Cool, well, medics are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah,medics and blacksmiths are more uncommon aswell.

<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, if any of you have questions, or need anything, feel free to ask. -- Then again, I'm sure we're all on equal level, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: After what ive seen from you Hanamura? Im unsure,atleast for myself
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) noticably entered a thoughtscape that painted his expression a bit grim, but it faded in a few moments, possibly snapped out of it by Hanamura. <font color = white>&#34;I wonder about that.&#34;</font> He would respond to her assumption. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) clapped his hands together.
<font color = white>&#34;You know what? This place needs a map. It&#39;s like a maze, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I agree.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its fine.Perhaps you guys need to go out more
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It can be confusing, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can easily remember it.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Exploring does help.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Be back soon a moment, sorry.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looks at Saigosame with narrowed lips, and shrugs as if to say <font color = white>&#34;I guess it&#39;s just you and me.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I could do with some sightseeing later, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: But it shouldn't be too difficult to remember everything, heh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) took a glance back at Subaru, and let out a defeated sigh. Now as forever, the Yuki and the Hoshigaki were united.
<font color = white>&#34;Man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) noticed the Hoshigaki&#39;s glance, making him blink a couple times.
<font color = white>&#34;Something wrong?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (oh, i'm cooked, that was meant for kusahara. my bad. i misread the chat.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (No worries. xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Huh? No. I mistook you for Kusahara. Listen- I'm REALLY tired.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) closed his eyes and took a deep whiff of the chill dusk air. 
<font color = white>&#34;Getting late.&#34;</font> He muttered to himself. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) eyes Kusahara and then looks down his own form.
<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we do look similar.&#34;</font> He&#39;d jest before shrugging.
<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, all is fine, really.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: More like getting early if you ask me, though.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (BRB)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (i missed wipe start last time i played srp so i was getting catchup and shit, but this.....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Early, late... It's all good time for sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Sounds like you'll need a pillow on your desk at the Academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) said with a slight smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I guess everyone is traning?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If I sleep through the lessons I'll end up super-behind.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or you guys just study inside the academy only
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I'm not some sort of super-genius... You know?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not either,but is good to practice what you have learned.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shrugged once more. <font color = white>&#34;I study on my own, but nothing too serious.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns to acknowledge the newly arrived person.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I see...then,what do you want to do after the academy ends?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Has...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Has the academy even STARTED yet?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank look to that question. <font color = white>&#34;What does a bird want to do when it&#39;s no longer a chick? We are Shinobi, most of us here will be fighting and probably dying for the village.&#34;</font> He said plainly. <font color = white>&#34;Hopefully dying later than sooner...&#34;</font> he added in a low tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It did started.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It will end in a year.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And...not everyone is a fighter.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: It is why I said "most of us here."
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: True..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case..hopefully we meet each other thoughout the year and inside the battlefield.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (Back. Freaking cat jumped on my PC's Power Button. xD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) ponders, for a few moments. Eventually, he raises a hand, and points up at the sun.
<font color = white>&#34;Make THAT go away.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) he lifted one hand in a greeting at the newly arrived person. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Kfh, no, I'm kidding. I'm going to head back home and get some actual sleep. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) picked himself up from the ground with a grumble, stretching his arms for a few moments before lumbering over towards the wall to his west. Without a second thought, he steps over the threshhold into the water, and disappears under the current.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) leans his head over ever so slightly in that of a nod.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: He must be -really- tired, huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) took a few more moments to size the fellow student up, then nodded and turned back to the centre of the gathering place.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I suppose so. He was quite tired when he arrived. I suppose he really needs a long nap, then. Which is fine, no classes have begun yet - today at least. As far as I am aware.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Hm? Oh, hey there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) looks from side to side. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay then.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Since there aren't much of any teacher awake or around, should we try to train, like, spar or something?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: ...Oh that's where everyone is.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: And I suppose we could spar, if any of you are interested. Could even make a sort of 'team spar' to see how well we work together. But, do not feel forced to, of course.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns his head back to look at the finely dressed kid, then put up a hand as a greeting.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) muttered something beneath his breath and began advancing forward towards the crowd. Maintaining his silence he'd hope to melt into the group seamlessly as they continued their discussion. However it seemed as though there was about to be a spar between two of the children. 

Closing his distance tween him and the others, the child began assessing the two. Maybe they were the top boys of Amegakure, or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) folds his arms and watches the bout from afar.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets again.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m fine with a spar or anything, really. Team or not. But yeah, I do wish the teachers would wake up and such, heh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm up for it. Would be nice to know what and who I'm working with in the future.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) looked towards the Yuki and the green-haired person before chuckling, covering her mouth as she did.
<font color = white>&#34;Three of us, then... Well, I suppose you two could spar, if you&#39;d like, and I&#39;ll just watch? That is, unless someone would like to join in?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Sure, I'll be up for that. You, Kusahara?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, sounds good.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Well, shal we do it here, or wanna go elsewhere? You got an idea, Hana?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm fine either way, but we don't want to go too far, in case the teacher arrives.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: When I sparred earlier, we went west a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Lead the way, then.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Follow me, hahaha. -- Anyone wanting to watch, feel free to watch along, as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) stretches his arms then follows briskly after the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Here's where I sparred, so, go ahead and face each other.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) settles into a closed fist, narrow fighting stance, gaze locked with his sparring partner.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) smirks as he enters a most simplistic stance.
<font color = white>&#34;Alright, just a spar, no need for any &#39;cool stuff&#39; or, well, serious injuries.
Can&#39;t wait to see how we&#39;ll do, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) smirks as he watces the other student get closer as well.
His own movement slowing down just a bit, only to get closer still.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) slowly advances, his fists in front of his body to deliver quick jabs once he is near enough. Once Yuki is close enough, Kushara would charge, upper body leant forward, ready to deliver quick upward strikes at the jaw of his opponent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) watches the two of them closely, seeing as their speed wasn&#39;t much different than her own speed, the two must have other capabilities that improve them.
Her eyes squint as Subaru would slow down a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what he&#39;s planning...&#34;</font> She&#39;d whisper softly, only to watch Kusahara next.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) draws near, mild curiosity along his visage. As the sparring match of sorts commenses he'd allow his eyes to traces both of the trainers movements.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) didn&#39;t let his smirk fade. Not even in the slightest, as he would weave himself past the uppercut-attempt coming from Kusahara, before aiming a jab of his own at the taller&#39;s stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice try!&#34;</font>

[Agility: E+]
[Dodged: 1/4 ]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) snarls and catches Yuki's fist, using the momentum of his strike to pull him closer, ready to deliver an elbow strike at the back of his head.

[Dodged: 1/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) kept his smirk up even when his own strike did not land.
Nimble movements, at least, for their comparitive levels, would allow him to move around his sparring partner, aiming to reach his side, dodging the attack once more before aiming a strike at their hip.

[Dodged: 2/4]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gasped swiftly at the incoming strike, taking a step back to reposition himself away from the attack and gather his strength.

[Dodged 2/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) didn&#39;t hold back, he&#39;d rush forward, ready to strike again.
His feet would slide over the dirt below, before his elbow would aim its way towards Kusahara&#39;s chest.

<font color = white>&#34;Heh, trying to get away, are we?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) focused his gaze and waited for the Yuki to get closer, before taking a risky gamble, sidestepping just before the attack landed, hoping to deliver a punch to the cheeks and knocking his opponent on the ground.

[Dodged 3/3] </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) would move away just in time, moving his left arm to intercept the upcoming blow, moving it out of the way before his own fist would aim at the center of the other&#39;s stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;Not bad! But I&#39;m not going to take any of your hits if I can prevent them!&#34;</font>

[Dodged again]
[Strength E]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) could not move fast enough to avoid the confident fist stabbing into his stomach! It had enough force to knock the air out of him, and leaving him crumbled on the ground, gasping and coughing.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah.... okay... you win!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) blinked as the blow did it for him.
Subaru would scratch the back of his head, however, before holding a hand out for his sparring partner.
<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t give up so fast, but, uh, yeah... We&#39;ll both get stronger, for sure.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It seems that went well? Are you both alright? It is a noble thing to see that you don't persist further, Subaru. And don't worry, Kusahara, I'm sure you'll have another chance later on to show how good you are, or how much you've improved then.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) , still clutching his stomach with one hand, allowed the Yuki to help him up from the ground. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah... well I am not sure I&#39;m cut out to be a taijutsu master... sorry to disappoint.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) yells: Hey, now, not disappointed at all!
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Heh, it was fun though.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: And I'm alright, Hanamura. Thanks.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) wiped the saliva off his face. <font color = white>&#34;Hm... it was.&#34;</font> He smiled softly, trying his best to hide it though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded at the young girl, then nursed his aching belly as he aimed to walk back to the monument where they gathered previously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Everyone has left it seems? Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I will have a look around.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Well, a couple of them were hiding in the trees, observing us.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, yes, I did notice such...
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Not sure if they are still there.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, I shall be back soon.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I feel like a wimp after going down like that.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Don't be like that, you're fine.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly approaches the bench where the other two individuals are situated. Their eyes never averting their gaze away from the bench where they are approaching. She slowly sits on the bench, clasping his palms together and resting their chin on their hands.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) takes a deep breath, the pain in his stomach now only a mild sensation reminding him of his sparring match. As he heard the child approaching and sitting down, his attention was drawn to her. Noting the bored posture, he raised an eyebrow. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) looked towards the child, a slight ponder was made before he&#39;d speak up.
<font color = white>&#34;You okay? Got bored or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly turns their head towards the two boys situated on the opposite end of the bench. His soft features seemingly slightly shimmering against the bright sunlight. A small sigh escapes their lips, as they begin to speak.

<font color = white>&#34;Boring? Yes, I guess that is a good way to describe it. Nothing ever happens around here...&#34;</font>, they say with the tone of an irritant child.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nothing happens? What do you mean? A lot has been going on, and a festival is starting soon, as well...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) frowns slightly. <font color = white>&#34;I would enjoy the peace while it lasts, personally.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a small yawn as they sat near the monument his hazel eyes scanning the other faces nearby</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: All of that is...boring.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So what do you consider exciting?
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Anyways, Kusahara, got any plans?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: I dont know..Something...fun maybe?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turned to Subaru. <font color = white>&#34;Not really.&#34;</font> He said, leaning back on the bench, and turning to the new kid. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, like what? There are many things one can find fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I dont know.. Maybe playing? Like ninja tag!
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Right...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) almost chuckled at that. Despite being thirteen, he already felt like it was a lifetime ago when he found childish things fun. <font color = white>&#34;I mean, I guess that&#39;s fun. We&#39;ll be needing to catch people when we go out on missions anyway, so in a way... it&#39;s training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) slowly rises up and stretches before sighing. <font color = white>&#34;Anyway, I&#39;ll go home and read something. That&#39;s my idea of fun on a sunny morning. See ya!&#34;</font> He&#39;d say and walk off towards his house.</font></font></font>
