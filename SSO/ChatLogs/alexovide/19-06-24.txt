<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Matsu, the Hyuuga martial artist, unwrapped his deceptive belt from around his waist, Sogeki observed with a keen, calculating gaze. The fabric seemed unnaturally long, hinting at hidden abilities or techniques beyond its mundane appearance. Sogeki remained outwardly composed, though his mind analyzed the unfolding situation with meticulous detail.

As Matsu tossed one end of the belt towards him, Sogeki noted the fluid motion and the controlled extension of the fabric. The belt surged forward, the material stretching unnaturally as it closed the distance between them with surprising speed.

The fabric wrapped around Sogeki swiftly, tightening with a suddenness that restricted his movements but allowed him to speak. He felt the constricting pressure against his body, a calculated move by Matsu to assert control and limit his freedom momentarily.

Maintaining his calm demeanor, Sogeki subtly wiped his palm against his vest, smearing a thin layer of sweat from his skin onto the fabric. It was a small, tactical move—preparing himself mentally and physically for any further developments in the encounter.

While outwardly restrained, Sogeki's focus remained sharp and unwavering. His eagle-like vision scanned the surrounding area, assessing the reactions of the students and bystanders. He remained alert for any sign of aggression or opportunistic movement, his mind calculating potential threats and strategies with cool precision.

Despite the temporary restraint, Sogeki's eyes conveyed a silent warning to those around him—a reminder of his readiness to respond swiftly and decisively to any challenge. His posture remained relaxed yet poised, a testament to his training and experience as a shinobi who thrived in moments of controlled chaos.

As Matsu prepared to release the binding, Sogeki awaited the moment with a measured patience, ready to assess the situation and determine his next course of action. The encounter had tested his resolve and adaptability, reinforcing his reputation as a shinobi who navigated challenges with calculated precision and unwavering focus.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) stood statue-still as the Hyuuga approached, though as the Jounin shifted into a combative stance they instinctively tensed up, reacting to absorb the brunt of whatever blow was to strike upon their form. However...

It barely moved the Hoshigaki, simply inching them back half a stepas the shark blinked in confusion. They peered down at their body from under that large straw hat, then back up at the Hyuuga, then back down, and back up once more.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m... Not entirely sure what that did, but it did <b>something</b>.&#34;</font>, they remarked, moving their arms, their legs, rolling their neck - Something was off, but they couldn&#39;t quite figure out what just yet.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) offered a sharp nod, throwing their hands together in a rather slow weaving of seals, intending to utilize the Bunshin technique. However...

<font color = white>&#34;... Nothing&#39;s happening. I&#39;m <b>positive</b> I weaved them correctly... It&#39;s...&#34;</font>

Looking for a pocket to exploit, the child's feet began picking up in pace as he charged forward. Reaching into his pocket, the child had summon a series of toothpicks. Wedging them between his fingers seconds before a flick of his wrist. Shooting wooden projectites directly at his callus right foot.

Stepping into the fray without hesitation, Sogeki closed the distance between himself and Afro. His trained vision provided a clear outlook of the arena&#39;s layout. Brandishing a set of weapons, he used his natural agility to evade projectiles aimed at him. Planting his feet firmly, Sogeki launched a wooden kunai at Afro&#39;s chest.

As he retalliated with a kunia, The sharp edges mirrored the sun's rays into the water as it hover through space. Performing a series of somesalts and spins to dodge the true aim of the kunai, Afro flicked his wrist once more, throwing another wooden senbon at the target.
