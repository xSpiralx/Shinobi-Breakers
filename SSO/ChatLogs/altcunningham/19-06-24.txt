A brief twist of movement could be noted; and she vanished into a blinding blur of immense speed and raw agility. She appeared directly before him, and looked down towards him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You do, yes,&#34;</font>

A fist was launched directly towards his stomach - she didn&#39;t care about the back-talk but this man has ushered forth something previously, and she had to repay the kind for what he had done. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You threw a rock at my cat,&#34;</font>

Without hesitation he reacts by headbutt=ing his head in to the fist to take on even greater force of the strike.
(Damage Cap raised to Critical)

Sending himself flying back off the contact and then splashing in to the water. A familiar sensation. Though last time he enjoyed flying higher in the air. For a moment he was under the water and eventually surfaced.

His pair of shirts was missing and he lacked shoes. Quite literally punched right out of his clothing.

Gripping his chest as many tears began to shed. Now floating on top of the water as he swayed around at its will.

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm,&#34;</font>

A groan eased into her throat again, and it was pushed back into place.
