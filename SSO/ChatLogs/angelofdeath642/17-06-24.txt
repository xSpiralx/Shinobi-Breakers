The medic swung back their bandaged arm..her body later jiggled...and the motion..actived some ...each sudden lost calorie from that high active movement..caused her seal to activate and bandage emited a poof of smoke..only to show a shuriken floating above her hand and later falling in the center of her palm!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shook his head ever so slightly as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;Nothing on Xing.&#34;</font>
All his time at the library and all he&#39;d come to learn within this particular study was that the village had a severe lack of information surrounding foreign languages.
     Though, he didn&#39;t fault them. Books of the nature seemed to pale in comparison to those focused around Shinobi forefronts needs such as combat, tactical and medical guides. 

    <i><font color = white>&#34;Perhaps they were more important.&#34;</font></i> - he thought, dull eyes seeming to peer into the ethereal realm between both him and Shyue as his mind began to race.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed briefly and subtly surprised, based off the widening and then narrowing of her eyes. She tried to remember if there were any books at home she could give him.

<font color = white>&#34;No luck learning a new language, then. There&#39;s a saying -- Rù xiāng suí sú.&#34;</font> The shift to a harsher, tonal language was jarring. <font color = white>&#34;When entering a village, follow its customs.&#34;</font>

 <font color = white>&#34;Why are you here?&#34;</font>, he questions.</font></font></font>

Then...&#34;</font> She seemed a little unsure to continue, remembering how some of the other children had spoke about the shogunate, and about the previous kage--

<font color = white>&#34;...I don&#39;t really remember much, since I was so young. But my tribe met the shogun. We moved in here, to Iwagakure. My mom was...&#34;</font> more hesitation. <font color = white>&#34;...a chosen servant of the shogun, and he settled us here. But the duel of fates is cruel, so after my youngest sibling, she was--&#34;</font>

A moment was taken to remeasure her emotions, and settle them <font color = white>&#34;--released from her burden. Wán bì guī zhào.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned, returning to the most natural expression she seemed to wear-- a scowl. This one is less directed. Internal. Her joke didn&#39;t seem to land. Finally, she seemed to come up with her answer.

<font color = white>&#34;I have no enemy except death. Therefore, I will deny it any victim, at every opportunity. I will slight it in every way I can. It took something important from me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen even so slightly as she spoken. She..
  Well she seemed to be just about his age yet she knew her. <font color = white>&#34;Purpose.&#34;</font>
    He says aloud.

   <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a beautiful thing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) would smile from ear to ear; a rare sight. Even her teeth were visible, however briefly before she regathered her composure.

<font color = white>&#34;I have to be strong for my little siblings.&#34;</font> Her dad was -- kind, but broken. Shuye had to at once be a mother and a sister to her siblings, lest they grow up to be idiots and get themselves hurt. It left little time for being young and playful. <font color = white>&#34;So... I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to make friends.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: You don't have many friends?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked over at Venturo--

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I lost.. I got jumped by the six armed girl and her cousin
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Damn. Must be really hard to dodge six arms, or twelve.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I thought you were popular like Yurei.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) shook her head.

<font color = white>&#34;I typically am the one who has to say hello first.&#34;</font> Did that mean you weren&#39;t popular? Shuye wasn&#39;t entirely sure, but it felt like it was true. The difference between being wanted and being tolerated could be subtle at times.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) jumped towards the arena with no hesitation, she seemed really excited immediately.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would raise up from her crawling position and placed her hands on her hips...her judo kimono fluttering before its motion..stopped.

She then moved to the center!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walkd to the center and bowed down respectfully for a few seconds, before standing up and getting into a better fighting stance compared to last time.

Then it was her biggest nightmare.

<font color = white>&#34;FUCK!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<i>shhhhaaa...booshhh!</i>

the smoke left the sides...however it seemed to be...vanish a moment later. When they tried to move..they would notice that they would feel..disoriented...a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;perfect...i will begin the lecture now....&#34;</font> 

She paused..

<font color = white>&#34;you see..in combat...there are things called..mm..ailments that might cause your movement to be hindered...in this case..you were hit with light poisen that targets your motor functions..&#34;</font>

There was a breif pause once more before she continued. She then held up her  herbalist badge..mhm..</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) stepped on the green tile completely unaware of what was going to happen.

<font color = white>&#34;Wha...whaaat? I can see..uh...&#34;</font> she looked at Koume with a very dumb-looking face.</font></font></font>

She paused...as she help up her hand and in a poof of smoke...a cup of juice appeared.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: for problem solving

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was starting to see things no one else could, the world was shaped at her will and her will was shaped by her world&#39;s.

<font color = white>&#34;...wah...&#34;</font>

Subconciously she managed to grab the cup of juice and take a sip of it - her eyes went back to normal and all the trippy stuff was gone. Fubuki was back to standing on the green tile, or rather she realized she stood on it the whole time.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...so how does the problem solving work? D-do we constantly get drugged in this game?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She paused for a moment as she reached into her judo cloak and took out a piece of paper to read. Her gaze skimmed through it before she found the passage she was looking for.

<font color = white>&#34;however it only lasts for a short while and....and be cooled with a water source....where that water source may come from..in a village like our own?...im not sure...so be careful of this...mhm...&#34;</font>

When Fubuki&#39;s gaze went unto her..there would be a wet towel mhm for them to and a dry towel for them to cool their skin with mhm

==================== katon burn perk ==================
Name: 

Incendiary Flame  

Desc:

 This character has mastered the art of sticky flame. By carefully molding their chakra, they produce fire from a chakra fuel that is adhesive and sticks to their target once they are struck. This makes it very difficult to remove and the fire will continue burning unless the victim employs precious seconds putting out the flames. 

Note:

Those struck by a fire technique continue to burn for petty injury for two turns. The victim may use their offensive action to put it out or use a water source of medium size or above.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) It was frankly amazing that Fubuki somehow didn&#39;t suspect anything when stepping onto the red tile, only when her foot landed on it did she understand the gravity of the situation. A part of her soul began crying for help.

<font color = white>&#34;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&#34;</font>

Her whole body was surrounded by fire! Her hair and skin got completely ruined and obviously she was burning everywhere. It wasn&#39;t much fire but it was enough to really scare her. While Koume spoke, Fubuki fell to the ground and started rolling around - when she was thrown a wet towel she&#39;d turn into a flaming burrito for a few seconds, rolling with it. Then she fire was put out.

Fubuki slowly stood up and exhaled, she grabbed the other towel and started cleaning herself. <font color = white>&#34;Koume...this is...totally great training, yeah...&#34;</font> she said in pain.

It was then it ended...however they would notice that the effects they suffered were worse that the poisen. But would last the less time than the poisen she used.

<font color = white>&#34;You would notice this is a lightning attack this time...these cost..an effect of electrocution....mm..no..a nervous system..error.i believe its called. It messes with your motor functions to a further degree and also messes with a casters handseal speed..not to meantion your how fast you move across the field...&#34;</font>

She paused as she laughed a bit akwardly..while placing her hands on her hips.

<font color = white>&#34;then theres the fact that you can also..stop a persons movement completely...if i remeber correctly from the stories ive heard...if hit directly with a technique itself.&#34;</font>

=========== more info below of the status aliment below ===========

Name:

Numbing Joltage  

Desc:

This character has developed the ability to sustain an electrical current that courses through the body of their victim if they are unfortunate enough to be struck by a lightning technique. The current is delivered as a numbing jolt of electricity that stuns the victim, slowing their reaction times considerably. 

Note:

Those struck by an electrifying lightning technique lose two steps of speed, agility, hand seal tempo, and tile movement until the end of their next turn.

Fubuki didn&#39;t have time to react to the lightning which shocked her whole body, spiking up her hair and making her stand up completely. When the shock was over everyone nearby could smell the girl was a bit burnt, right before falling to the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I-I-.---I---II....IIII...&#34;</font> the nervous shock had  been so severe she couldn&#39;t even speak, Fubuki was a frozen statue on the floor except for the occassional twitch. However this lasted only a few seconds before she stood up and regained her movement.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would laugh a bit before shaking her head meaning no.

<font color = white>&#34;u-unfortunately not..theres about...one more you might have to suffer through...before we go into..the next section.&#34;</font>

She paused.

<font color = white>&#34;b-but i dont really have a suiton tile..so your lucky mhm!..&#34;</font> With a light wink..she found herself continueing there after. <font color = white>&#34; For suiton..it mostly messes with your movement across the field...if i remeber correctly...same with fuuton....with the case it knocks you back....so your all fine on that front&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: if i had something to add..hmm..it would be to teach you about...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s eyes widened, her soul was ready to die as soon as Koume mentioned there was one more tile to go. But thankfully the game was still in early access and the suiton tile hadn&#39;t been added, so she sighed out of happiness and laid on the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m free...from the pain--&#34;</font>

And then the obstacle course turned into the other one.

<font color = white>&#34;...Fuck.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would poof away her previous course and summoned a new one into existance. Upon returning...she looked to the yellow mushroom.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would hold up training shuriken for them to take!

<font color = white>&#34; throw this at the mushroom behind you&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (br question, do shurikens use agility or strength for its speed)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [hmm agility i think..]

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) grabbed the shuriken and turned around - she saw one of those toads again.

<font color = white>&#34;NOT YOU.&#34;</font>

She immediately threw the shuriken towards the mushroom, hitting it on its big dumb-looking head. Fubuki had a lot of resentment for those things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Oh is she playing the game again?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I assume only fubuki gets to play

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Missed all the fun.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Help.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) gives a wide closed-mouth smile to Fubiki.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) waved at Yurei before she got tortured once more on this lesson.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: Yeah, nice to meet you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) continued to stare into the ethers, no telling where his mind had carried him in all his idle <i>'meditation'</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was ignored--

<font color = white>&#34;See, Raku? Not popular.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) actually smiled at Shuye, it was still early for the author.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) omit</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) didn't wave at Yurei because FUCK him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would hold up a hand to cover her mouth! 

She tried to hide the fact she was giggling at...the resentment she saw. They were off duty..so it should be..f-fine..she hoped.

====================== mushroom! =============

The yellow mushroom found themselves being attacked..and moved forwards to try and attack them before the shuriken hit their body!...however it..the shuriken hit their squishy body before they collaped on the ground to play dead!

<i>ploop!!!</i>
=====================================

<font color = white>&#34; you see...y-you see...a-ahem..you see...the reason why the mushroom couldnt counter you is because of they way the order of attacks work in this world. Perhaps made this way by the shogan himself. &#34;</font> She found herself..pausing breifly..before speaking once more.

<font color = white>&#34;Shurikenjutsu happens..first...and taijutsu happened after it mhm...however it expands to something more...as after a bit of experimentation and a few lost lifes of our iwagakurian shinobi...we have a detailed list..to make it easier for the newer generation&#34;</font>

Reaching into her pocket...she held up a piece of paper for them to read off of.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh, I see.&#34;</font> She grabbed the piece of paper and read it for a bit before handing it back. <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, that was nice and uhh...not torture, like earlier.&#34;</font> Fubuki&#39;s body still had burn marks.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sup.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Anything interesting happen?

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Swords will come and go.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: You also want to own a sword?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had been spaced out staring at the water and didn&#39;t realize Shuye approached him. Spacing back in he spins around to continue talking to her without being rude.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, with they&#39;d actually ever come though. They&#39;re like several bajillion ryo...&#34;</font>

He then looks to Fubuki and shrugs,

<font color = white>&#34;I just wanted to buy something shiny to be honest.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. Well, I'm only five hundred ryo short for a katana, thanks to Hana.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: That's pretty cheap for a sword.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I-It is?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah. The ones in this village's shop are like, eight thousand.

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: A thousand ryo...? I'm not even a ninja and have half that.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Maaaaan why does everyone have more money than I do?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh, a friend I met. She gave me money.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wish my friends would give me money...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: At least you have friends. That is a different sort of wealth.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) ears quirk up at the sound of &#39;buy something shiny&#39;.

With a overdramatic backflip from the arena, she lands next to the red-haired boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Well let me show you my wares!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed.

Her hands came together, a loud clap echoing out, before she withdraws her hands apart towards either side of her. As her hands stretched out, shimmering pink crystals formed, making unique patterns along the way until she&#39;d finally reached as far as she could.
 <font color = white>&#34;Just fifty Ryo and I&#39;ll make a shiny object of your choice!&#34;</font>

Was she attempting to scam children? Yes. Did she care? Absolutely not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) is a little too wise-- or perhaps, more accurately, a little too jaded, to fall for this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) sloooowly turns to face Kitsumi. Clearly not having forgotten how quick she was to pawn the work of repairing the gate and stairs off on literally anyone else. His eyes narrow, staring at her for a moment. However he&#39;s immediately distracted by the crystals. His brain was smooth and the rocks were pretty.

<font color = white>&#34;A shiny object of my choice?! Out of crystal right? That&#39;d be awesome...&#34;</font>

He cups his chin in his hand and begins pondering what to ask for. Eventually snapping his fingers and holding out fifty ryo to the Shingen.

<font color = white>&#34;I want a crystal monkey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hideo, you want money yet you spend it on this?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Just... make him a mirror...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: What's the point of having money if I don't spend it- Shuye are you suggesting I'm a monkey?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But you're always complaining about money, maybe save a little first...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) scowled externally, and smiled internally. Silence and eye contact is the answer.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm not *complaining* about money! I just *want* money. There's a difference!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. I guess then, fair enough.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And I want money so that I can spend it! Spending money makes me feel better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) continued flipping through his book.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What do you want to spend it on though? Just anything?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean, anything that's cool yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Liiiike a crystal monkey!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Should have got a rock-candy monkey.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I don't think she can make rock-candy... But that does sound awesome!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) gave a nod in response before clasping her hands together once again. All the crystals she&#39;d formed turned into nothing but sparkles in the air as her hands met.
 <font color = white>&#34;Of course!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed once again, the prospect of profit clearly warranting more energy out of the normally aloof girl.

As her hands began pulling apart, a Curious George-esque monkey formed within her palms, shimmering against the sunlight. Little by little it came together, its slightly larger than body head forming first, followed by its body and limbs, until finally she added a little curved tail at the end.

Extending her hand out, she offered the piece to the boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now, my crystals are resistant to near everything in such compact form, so breaking it should be hard!... UnlessIdiebutthenwe&#39;reallscrewed.&#34;</font>, she finished with a bright smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Utsuwa, Himeki has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) &#39;s eyes light up as Kitsumi begins. Watching with awe as the little paperweight takes shape. Mumbling to no one in particular as she works,

<font color = white>&#34;Maaan manipulating crystals is so cool...&#34;</font>

Taking the monkey, he holds it up toward the sun. Turning it around in the air and simply looking at the sparkles.

<font color = white>&#34;This is awesome!&#34;</font>

Then his ears perk up at the claim of it being extremely durable. A clear mental battle is fought as he resists the urge to drop it or rap a knuckle against it to test her claim. For a moment he wonder if she was actualyl lying and the complete opposite was true-

What if this thing was super fragile!

He carefully lowers it, now holding it in both hands. He nods to Kitsumi and says,

<font color = white>&#34;This is super cool. Thank you Kitsumi. Worth fifty ryo...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Of course! I'm available from nine-to-five on weekdays.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I-Isn't that just your normal shinobi hours?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Yep!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) taps the side of her head a few times.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched the display from the front row. Honestly, she was expecting it to be a total scam. It wasn't. The jounin was a surprisingly talented sculptor, and Hideo seemed very pleased by the item he received, too. If it was true that it wouldn't break...</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) leans forward towards the boy, gripping his shirt.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) would look towards his left to see a man with the massive burn scar on the right side of his body, it looked extremely painful and all he could think about was how narley it was.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Anyways! Anyone else want a crystal of their choice?! Only fifty-ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: No thanks, I'm saving money for a sword.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Are you selling crystals to the kids.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) asks: uhh what can you make?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Himeki! Do you want a crystal thingy from Kitsumi? I'll pay for it!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Maybe! And I can make mostly anything! The larger it is, the less durable it is, though!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Im pretty sure you dont need the money Kitsumi, boy Its Sensei Kitsumi to you. It's like you dont have any good upbringing.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat... I totally need the Ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She hasn't even taught me anything though! Tch, not my sensei...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Feel free to hit him over the head, Kitsumi.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Well.. If you're learning Doton or Shurikenjutsu, I'm your girl! If it's anything else, I'm clueless!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Dad no!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) reaches out and bonks the child over the head.

No missed opportunities to bully children.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately drops down. Squatting and moving to hold a hand against the spot he&#39;d been hit. Sucking air through his teeth as he mumbles,

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhhtatatata...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: This is a fight you cannot win.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Silently positioned by a tree, observing others present with a tired demeanor, the reticent young boy made use of a small mirror to peer into the deepening bags under his eyes.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He's dead.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I wonder if I could crystalize the whole moat with you guys in it...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead its much better than the lump thats about to form on your head.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Jump in the moat for me right quick...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Can I take off my clothes first?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Soggy socks are the worst...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uh... That's up to your dad not me. You might catch a cold, or something I'dunno.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: . . . .

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Thank you Shuye.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) looked like a wreck, with the sun looming over Iwagakure, blinding the child. It's easy to assume that the child doesn't get out much. Blinking twice in a slow manner, the pocket mirror is placed away into a pouch as the 5'3 child continues to watch the proceedings of those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) flickered towards his son, kicking up a gentle waft of dust, before kicking him into the water with a sideways kick.

<font color = white>&#34;Just get in the water you bastard&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) was in the process of holding out the crystalline monkey to Shuye as he&#39;s kicked in the chest. A pathetic grunt is shouted out as he is sent straight into the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Guh!&#34;</font>

Unfortunately he was a big kid and his clothes were now soaked. So rather than simply swim back to edge like a normal person; he flailed around helplessly for a few seconds. Splashing water everywhere and toward all those nearby. Before eventually realizing the moat wasn&#39;t very deep.

And remembering that he could walk on water. With a sigh he plants his hands on the surface of the water and pulls himself up and out. Shaking in place like a dog, trying to get rid of at least some of the water. Which, was almost entirely futile.

Grumbling to himself he returns to his spot and glares at his father.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to call me a bastard too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) asks: Hey, Mugen. On a scale of one-to-ten, how cool do you think a crystal statue of him would be?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Is there a Negative? option.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I can't believe you'd say that about your eldest son...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Your only son!

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Y-You wouldn't...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: We can seal him away, Mugen.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Just say the word...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Please don't...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) The boy was gone before she could blink. Before the wind hit the back of her kimono from the man's movement. He was in the water before the surface tension broke and bubbled. But still, Shuye had her hands out, and managed to catch the monkey before it fell to the ground. Would it have shattered? Probably not. But they didn't need to know.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) smiles brightly as she holds up a single seal. In that very moment, the ground beneath Hideo would begin to crystalize, slowly crawling up his legs.

Well, slowly to her. To him? It was a near instant encapsulation!

As it finally reached up to his neck, she stopped the crystals and turned to Mugen.
 <font color = white>&#34;Tada!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) sips the moat water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) looks down at the crystals growing beneath him. Quickly looking toward Kitsumi he shout,

<font color = white>&#34;No! Release me! I command y-&#34;</font>

Before being cut off and entombed in a gemstone prison. His smooth brain now perfectly immoratlized in crystaline form.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Blankly staring at the iron vessel and the pale-skinned girl, the child only had the energy to blink in a lazy manner, with cruelty on full display. Getting involved might result in their scandalous activities being directed towards him after all.

As crystals crept up Hideo's frame, the reticent young boy confirmed their insanity, taking solace in the natural concealment offered by the bark of the rather large tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The lumberjack, jack-Kristuria) begins to tirelessly swing a large axe at the tree before him. He didn't have a permit and this was illegal.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) taps the frozen statue of his son, with a finger tentatively, considering how long he should leave him like that.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uhm...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Probably not!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) retracts the crystals just enough to free his nose.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now he can!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Ah good.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately inhales sharply. His nostrils flaring as he breathes. And, while he couldn't move his jaw, he could shit spew a stream of expletives. Granted the sound comes out of his nose as a garbled grunt that was completely incomprehensible. But it made him feel better.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: I think he likes it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: AHOUKINGAOLESEEIEOU!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: ELEASEEIOMMANDI!

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Whats going on?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: More torture.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: I wanna do that sometime.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa Guard (The masked guard-ChainsOfMadness) turns off as he begins glancing around, it would’ve been a lie if he said he’d seen the young boy integrate himself.

With a quiet sigh, he barks to the reticent young boy. <font color = white>&#34;Come on, we didn’t travel all the way from Akhibara just for you to shy away. Meet your peers, make some friends, you’re back home now.&#34;</font>

He approaches the boy hiding behind the tree, mostly obscured. The man had very excellent hearing though, and could tell just who was behind there. <font color = white>&#34;Don’t be afraid of them&#34;</font> he says aloud whilst thinking &#39;they should probably be afraid of you&#39;

He motions forward, <font color = white>&#34;come on, Hitoshi. You’ll need to make friends so we can get you a proper squad after graduation&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I didn't expect that from you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked at the two toned headed youth, withaa puzzled expression. He wanted to torture people? The jounin simply shook his head and returned his attention towards his crystalized son.

<font color = white>&#34;Well did you learn your lesson&#34;</font>?,he asked with a smirk on his face, awaiting the boys response.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Utsuwa, Himeki has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: So... should I...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Put the monkey down...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) held it awkwardly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: It's not mine.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Released dread into the atmosphere, metaphorically dampening the air with its mere presence alone. The tired, cold eyes of the hiding boy peered from around the bark. They had become engaged with the Iwa guards. How did the guard ever surmise that the reticent boy happened to be positioned behind the tree?

Shifting a defeated and exhausted gaze to the floor, a steady flow of air is sucked through the hiding one's nostrils. Coming out from behind the tree, the 5'3 boy became more visible, appearing to be frail dressed in comfy clothes and sporting unkempt hair.

No words were offered to the Iwagakure guard, even if the child obliged their request.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: OIinoearnmesson. Ourolansmea. Sueleaseumoneyown.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks behind him and would see a kid hiding behind a tree; assuming he was shy and hearing what the Iwa Gaurd he&#39;d think about introducing himself and saying hI to the other kid.

Getting up from where he was sitting he&#39;d walk towards the other kid, Kuro was scratching his face a bit while looking at the other kid. <font color = white>&#34;hey that tree doesn&#39;t give much cover, you should try a wall.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say before laughing a bit trying to be funny and trying to lighten things up. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kuro, and you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) could only continue to aggressively mumble through his nose in response to his father and Shuye.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked towards the scowling red eye girl. 
<font color = white>&#34;Monkey&#34;</font>?,he asked her with a tilt of his head, rasing his fist and cracking open the crystal prison which held his son captive.

<font color = white>&#34;Where did you get a monkey lassie&#34;</font>?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) says: Damn.. I heard a rumor some guy got encased in crystal..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It's crazy how that strength doesn't even break the crystal..)
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I mean. He's right there. In front of you.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Lmao
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was indeed holding a crystal monkey. It wasn&#39;t that big, but it wasn&#39;t small either. She looked to the pale-skinned girl, then at her victim and the man&#39;s son.

<font color = white>&#34;Hideo bought it from her.&#34;</font> She answered, matter-of-factly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) blinks awkwardly as Mugen&#39;s hand slams against her Crystal.
 <font color = white>&#34;Uh.. Do you want me to release him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) says: Rumors sure do travel fast..

<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It's A+ power)

<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) continues shouting through his nose. Now, clearly laughing, as his father's hand hits the crystal and fails to break it. Granted the laughing sounds more like a struggling wheeze as his chest couldn't really move to breathe enough to properly laugh.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa Guard (The masked guard-ChainsOfMadness) looks at the young boy with a smile, though it wouldn’t be seen behind the mask

<font color = white>&#34;Much better, I’ve got some duties to run but you be good now. And no…losing control ya?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) releases the poor boy from his crystal prison. A smile present on her face as she did.
 <font color = white>&#34;Did you have fun?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) loudly gasps as if he hadn&#39;t been able to breathe for the past few minutes. Given that his chest couldn&#39;t actually expand at all his breathing had been really shallow. But now he was free!

He leans forward, planting his hands on his knees as he pants for a few moments. Shaking his head and mumbling,

<font color = white>&#34;That totally sucked...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (and they said shingen aint shit fr

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Squinting as sunlight once again harasses his irises, Hitoshi's vision returns and he is met by a boy with one eye covered. As the fellow approaches, they are met with a gaze capable of piercing the soul directly. Kuro ridiculed the reticent one's stealth capability. Unsure of what to do now, the young, frail boy contemplated fleeing.

It's true, to be an exemplary shinobi required a squad, alongside the respect and admiration of fellow Iwagakurens. With a chilling silence, all that's offered is a nod. It's one of acknowledgment.

Kuro and Hitoshi were now best friends.
 Right?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked towards the red eyed girl, his eyes falling onto the crystal monkey. Shaking his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Spending his money on silly trinkets..the apple does not fall to far from the tree..&#34;</font>,he sighed his own spending problems in the back of his mind.

<font color = white>&#34;Infact keep it red eye&#39;s its yours now...&#34;</font>,he patted her on the head.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: That sounds like the textbook definition of a silly trinket.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Nah)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It wouldn't work)

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: No-No Shuye its yours think of it as my gift to you, for holding it for that moron.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) having finally caught his breath, he holds out his hand towards Shuye.

<font color = white>&#34;Ignore my dad! Thanks for holding the monkey Shuye.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) continued to wait  to hear the other kid speak, but he didn&#39;t speak only nodding his head. Kuro would assume that he just didn&#39;t like talking and just left it at just that. <font color = white>&#34;Not much of a talker I guess, thats fine I can do enough talking for the both of us.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d say as he would get a little bit closer before looking back at the gaurd. <font color = white>&#34;Hey mr Gaurd do you know his name? I don&#39;t think hes much of a talker.&#34;</font> he would say to the gaurd.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) felt ramping anxiety and building tension towards more physical violence. Shuye is paralyzed.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Hideo, if that monkey is returned to you. I will ask Kitsumi to seal you up again.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: I could give it to my little sister, Hideo?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Forced to smile, Kuro met with yellow-stained teeth and dead eyes followed by an illuminated grin. Stepping closer, that smile faded. If Kuro is now the voice for both of them, Hitoshi would have faith.

Blinking once at Kuro, the frail boy extended a hand, attempting to gently tug on Kuro's sleeve.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) pocketed the crystal monkey, somehow.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True. Great things come to those who do great works. 
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If your luck isn't good, you're literally not destined for greatness.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: In that case you have to go against your fate.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Speaking of great works. How did you do in that brawl?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Quiet Fubuki! I will go against my fate! I'm just that cool- Oh I lost Katora. But I snagged a flag before going down.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Not bad. It could be worse. I heard rumors some goofy bunch had a free for all in the girl's washroom of all places.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Chin up. Be glad you weren't them.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Really? The girls bathroom was a fight spot too?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, I found a boy there and he wanted to fight so we fought.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Me Gosu and Yurei fought in the boys bathroom. What're the odds...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) didn&#39;t do anything while the shy kid was tugging on his sleeves, only looking at him curiously.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah what happened?&#34;</font> He asked questioningly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Then entered an Akimichi, then Yurei.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: We fought for so long we couldn't end our fight before the alarm bell rang, so we just dropped it.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Laaaame, you didn't even finish?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wanted to but there was an emergency going on.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh yeah the explosions and the weird guy at the gate.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You would not have beaten Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair. As for me... I just stood in one place and fought whoever dared to try me.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Did you end up winning Katora?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Right in the middle of the hall. In plain sight.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Meixun and I couldn't beat each other so we teamed up against other people.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Nice, congrats man!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Didn't lose a single ribbon.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I lost no ribbons either.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) The frail  boy is now exceptionally close to Kuro, close enough for the other kid to pick up the powerful scent of coffee. He raises a single thin finger, pointing it towards the larger group. At this point, the reticent young boy's stomach is turning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A pity we didn't get to fight. If I recall? You handled the game pretty well too, Tsuneko.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah I bet having six arms is a pretty cool advantage.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: Yeah theres people over there.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: haven't really talked to any of them though.
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: ......
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I would have lost for sure, if you decided to gang up on me with Reilin.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: the redhead looks intimidating though...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hideo, just so you know I was hunting for you. But alas.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) nodded, kuro has a good head on him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You were? Ha, I knew you liked me.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You're literally a brat.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: How dare you. I am the total opposite! And am, in fact, super cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Peaked around Kuro only to see all of them standing idle, there's a feeling of unapproachability.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Right, the kid who gets bullied by his father constantly.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wouldn't a brat be spoiled? I'm literally the opposite of spoiled...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It must be what they call a 'tough love' parenting style. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: My dad literally just gave away something I bought with my own money!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm destitute even!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Not necessarily spoiled. Maybe rat fits better though.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It's only fair. You probably owe him like fifty-thousand ryo for all the clothes and food he gave you until now.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I don't owe him a debt for being his son!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You're in debt, Hideo. I'm sorry to break it to you like this.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah you're fifty thousand into debt, you're fucked.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-No way...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I don't even have fifty ryo anymore...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You spent your last fifty ryo on a crystal monkey.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yes, yes I did.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just do the obstacle course ten thousand times.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Only for it to end up with a girl you're not even friends with. Life is cruel,...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: W-We're totally friends Shuye...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It'll all work out. Just got to work one-thousand times harder.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm already working a million times harder than most of you! What do you mean another thousand times?!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: But if it's what I have to do... I'll push past my limits!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks at the group and back at The reticent young boy; he noticed that he would constintly look at the group but wouldn&#39;t actually go towards them.

<font color = white>&#34;we&#39;ll have to talk to them eventually, they are around our age, we&#39;ll probably see them around from time to time.&#34;</font>

Turning back to face the group he&#39;d attempt to grab at the kids sleeve inorder to bring him along.

<font color = white>&#34;we should go say hello.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm working one-thousand and two times harder, sucks to suck man.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) quirked a brow at Hideo.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh... okay, if you want to be friends, okay then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah well your forehead is big is Fubu- Oh cool, sounds good to me Shuye.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Not as big as your dents.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Take that back right now...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nope.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Hideoo has dents?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: The dents aren't even something I can control!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: One thousand times the forehead space versus one thousand times the skull dents. Who will win?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I will, Katora!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: What's with my forehead now?!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nothing's wrong with your forehead Fubuki.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: It's a nice forehead.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Thanks, very cool.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Perhaps you could rent advertising space on your forehead.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Dude. I do need five hundred ryo though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fubuki, the billboard of Iwagakure...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: In this economy? Not a bad option.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24)  soft silk sweater is grabbed by Kuro as he successfully manages to steal away Hitoshi to pursue the frivolous endeavor of meeting new friends. Stricken by anxiety and a shred of embarrassment, the reticent boy doesn't offer a verbal objection.

So he must be fine with it!
 Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I mean we're all broke, I don't think it's that humiliating. Anything for a Katana...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kamei, Hitoshi(The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) OOCs: (A soft silk sweater*)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Nothing humiliating about it. Do what you gotta do!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, no one will be laughing after I bonk them with a sword.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Very true.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: You could-- uhm, maybe find a job at the ramen stand? Or the tea shop?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) Kuro would take the boy and would run towards the group pulling the boy behind him, after a few seconds they were next to the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, I&#39;m Kuro and me and my friend just wanted to say hello to you all.&#34;</font> He said before looking at his new friend.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: They might like that you're so-- uhh, tall.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I mean. not tall..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I need to make more friends too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I 'unno, I think I'm still too young for a job.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Except...we can become shinobi as kids...huh.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Jobs are good...  Ramen...  Mmm.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Fubuki do you make sammishes?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Don't think about it too hard Fubuki. I certainly don't.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Er, sammiches.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) nearly tripped during the approach to the group present. F, forcing his head down for a brief second before looking back up ato the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What are sammiches?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) leans forward and waves to Kuro and the boy beside him.

<font color = white>&#34;Hi! I&#39;m Utsuwa Hideo, nice to meet you both!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Er.  Sandwiches.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks to Kuro and his friend, waving for a moment with a light smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You're the second person to ask me for a sandwich. The first one was a cunt.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: A what now?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But you seem nice so sure I wouldn't mind making one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) is only capable of granting a chilling silence. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) hummed, suddenly hungry.

<font color = white>&#34;Food...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) placed his attention on the duo delivering a greeting to the masses. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. I&#39;m Katora. Fuma Clan.&#34;</font>
His introduction is accompanied by a lazy lift of hand. Barely a wave before his arm fell slack at his side.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) asks: o-oh?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Do you have snacks, sensei?
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Utsuwa, Himeki has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) waved at the duo once they showed up, she was looking kinda mad thinking about whether her forehead was too big or not.

<font color = white>&#34;Sup Kuro and his friend, I&#39;m Fubuki.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: i...
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: Its nice to meet you too, Katora, Fubuki, Hideo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) reaching into her judo kimono..she slowly pulled out!...

a chocolate bar..and..a couple of bags of chips</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [hmm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked at the snacks, then at Choko.

Were they for sharing? Probably not...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Managed to catch the blonde lad's lazy hand lift with his peripherals. It's then, after Fubuki introduces herself, an angry aura puts the reticent young boy on guard in an instant.

Not knowing how to respond, the frail one peered to Kuro. 
He took the words right out of Hitoshi's mouth.

With an unintentional head bop, Kuro's newfound friend reveals a bag of ground coffee beans. Scooping a couple right into his mouth, the reticent young boy continued to stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would slightly distracted for a moment as the had a new obstical course idea in mind...

But her motions continued to hold up the chocolate bar for them to take and a bag of chips!

As for what brand of choclate it was..she began to speak..as she held it out first.

<font color = white>&#34;chocolate and love..hearts entwin..sweetness divine...aroma..of coca fine..mhm&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;however its slightly bitter..it also contrasts with sweetness...a delecate balance mm...oddly..of true innocense and bliss..&#34;</font>

The brand of the chocolate bar..red Fujiya. <font color = white>&#34;mm..s-sorry..it came to mind mhm dont worry i wont go on a monologe about chips now..&#34;</font> A light akward laughter was later given mhm..as she hold it out for them to take there after!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) took the chocolate bar!

She didn&#39;t seem to mind the sweetness of the chocolate, or the bitterness of the cocoa that flavored it. <font color = white>&#34;What does that word mean?&#34;</font> She asked, pointing to Fujiya on the wrapper as she munched.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: m-mm..good question..if i remeber correctly..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks over to the other boy and sees him cugging down scoops of ground coffee down his mouth. <font color = white>&#34;huh you must really love ground coffee, must taste reall good for you to down it like that.&#34;</font> He said to the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;hey if you like it who am I to judge, might want to slow down though.&#34;</font> he said to the boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) reaching into her pocket, she took out a piece of paper.

<font color = white>&#34;hmm..a-ah..its a word..that is an extention of Fujiyama..which translates to..volcano..or volcano mountain....which is rather smart..since our headband..is a rock....&#34;</font>

She paused as she found her next answer

<font color = white>&#34;t-though...i didnt know..they thought that deep when..about it..mm it it might be another one of the shogans words..oh..branding....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24)  // Liking pure ground coffee? Hitoshi's head tilted in amazement at that remark. With a dead tired expression, the stash of ground coffee is presented to Kuro. A gift to celebrate their extended friendship.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) was of sharp visual acuity. The Silent One&#39;s abnormal choice of snack does not evade his sight. And yet. He only finds it in him to stare, rather than question the whys. It&#39;s rude to point out oddities in others, says his sense of decency. Besides. Someone else did it for him. 

No answer came. A mute? Maybe.

In the meantime?
<font color = white>&#34;So.. you didn&#39;t win your brawl. But. Did you lose any ribbons?&#34;</font>
He asked the lavendar-haired Swordswoman in Training over there a question.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: t-that..reminds me..
<br><font color=red>*Hanaka, Ashimiya has switched their status to On Mission
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fuma, Katora(The blond lad-Iodized Salt) OOCs: [?]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (sorry im back was it rp'd at?
<br><font color=red>*Fuma, Katora has switched their status to Free Roaming
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was kinda busy doing absolutely nothing before the evil pebble thrower caught her attention. Like last time she jumped next to him to not have an akward distance between them.

<font color = white>&#34;Nah, but it&#39;s all thanks to Meixun. He sacrificed one of his ribbons for mine. That being said, did you lose any ribbons?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) would accept the gift of the ground coffee; it was gifted to him from a friend so it'd be rude of him to reject the gift.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a shake of head.
<font color = white>&#34;Not a single one.&#34;</font>

A moment is spent holding his chin in thought before he asks something more. 

<font color = white>&#34;You went with the squading-up strategy? I would have placed money on you going solo. Or did they decide to become your follower and support your climb to the top?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would find herself thikning for a moment before the sturned to leave the area.

<font color = white>&#34;il...be right back&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shaked her head at all of those.

<font color = white>&#34;I was going solo at first, looking for Hideo to kick his ass. Shame he was on the one place I couldn&#39;t go...anyways, Meixun and I were in a stalemate &#39;cuz we couldn&#39;t get each other&#39;s banners so we teammed up against the ones who were gonna team up on us. It was pretty cool.&#34;</font>

Then she looked at Katora, squinting her eyes a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;Why do I get the feeling you just waited until everybody else eliminated each other?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Nii-san
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [back]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (wb)

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: D-Did I just time travel...?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I feel like almost an hour passed as I was blinking...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It's been a year actually, you've been in a coma.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No kidding...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed the faintest muffled laugh.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m nowhere near that conniving.&#34;</font>

Out of habit, he plucked a kunai from his holster and spins it like a propeller on his index finger, just to keep them occupied. 

<font color = white>&#34;All my encounters were left to fate. I stood out in the open and waited for my enemies to fine me. Granted... I did have extra insurance set up. In the form of a Kawarimi. If you go hunting? You lose the advantage of preparation time. But. No one ever managed to land a clean hit on me, so I didn&#39;t get to use those measures.&#34;</font> 

He gave a shrug.
<font color = white>&#34;I fought twice back to back. One on ones. And then? The final free for all here in the arena.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fuma, Katora(The blond lad-Iodized Salt) OOCs: [find me* /autocorrect]

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) noticed, then, that he was on the wrong side of the arena...

<font color = white>&#34;Oh. Okay, I&#39;ll only show you...&#34;</font> She stepped back. <font color = white>&#34;If you use your ninja training to jump across the water.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) let out an exascerbated sigh, looking at his clothing for a few moments. He still wasn't well versed enough to trot upon water just yet, so he'll need to settle with more.... Improvisational practices.

He formulates a few seals he remembered from a scroll read, then he lifted his undershirt, folding the linen neatly into a triangular plate before creasing each edge with both hands. Undoing the metallic string that held his tailed hair in the back--his hair's apparently getting longer--he wraps it around the congruent angle's point, folding that down to support the shape.

All of this was to make some sort of makeshift throwing item, to which the boy flexes his quads to toss off to the other side! Unfortunately for his aim, he ends up hitting Kitusmi, having said item dangle to the ground unceremoniously. Though there wasn't much of any time to react to that, he mosies over toward Fubuki, poking her before hissing a whisper.</font></font></font>

As Meixun got closer he'd hear a very small snore coming from Fubuki, she was standing still and not moving except for her breathing. The boy's poke however woke her up and immediately she looked kinda around, confused and unaware of what was going on. It took her a moment to realize Meixun wanted to talk to her, so she lowered herself to hear him better. The girl thought about what the boy said before whispering something back.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) honestly had no idea what the boy said earlier but it seemed like she kinda understood it by the end. Regardless the sleepy girl also followed the boy, right behind him.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Kay, ready?&#34;</font>

And right after, without waiting for his approval, she&#39;d karate chop his head - it was just lightly hitting his head, not causing any actual damage.

He repeated his little noise dramatically as if the strike did any true damage, dissolving his will to stand.

The razors on his eyelids dig into his browline as he patters down with a divalike splash, seemingly unmoving for a while.
And... A little while more.... And more, and a bit more.... Enough mores that abit of concern should be called for...The water wasn&#39;t deep enough for him to drown, but any thalassaphobe would feel less than ideal about the blanket of liquid that engulfed them.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) bonked the boy on the head and immediately fell asleep right after. She was really tired today after being tortured and traveling to another village. But the sudden loud noise of a splash woke her up in confusion, which woke up Fubuki again. Once more she looked around and realized...Meixun must&#39;ve done a technique!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, so you wanted to show me this r--&#34;</font>

She looked down and saw the boy on the water, simply floating. Not moving. At all.

<font color = white>&#34;MEIXUN?!&#34;</font>

Fubuki went down to grab him in a hurry, desperately trying to pull him up...she thought she had killed him. Even though she was older, the girl wasn&#39;t that strong physically. All she ended up doing was falling towards the pool of water as well, right next to Meixun.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) felt like he just watched a murder play out in slow motion. He wasn&#39;t drowning, right--?
A slant of posture permits him a view of the boy floating in the water face up. Good. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve killed him in board daylight. Merciless,&#34;</font> he told her, despite being able to tell the kid was breathing even from this distance. </font></font></font>

He looked at his ruined undershirt, realizing that he&#39;s just soaked one of his favorite clothes for a shinobi technique.... A frown pinched on his lips before he turned over to Shuye, <font color = white>&#34;Daole shenme daole shenme?&#34;</font> He chanted eagerly.

It&#39;s been a while since either of the Zhu siblings brought up their youngest sister, so whatever the eldest got must&#39;ve been very sentimental.

Now she started actually panicking. She put her hands where the boy was, as if thinking he somehow turned into water.

<font color = white>&#34;M-Meixun? I didn&#39;t hit you that hard did I- AHHHH!&#34;</font>

Fubuki was startled by Meixun&#39;s chanting, who had made it to the other side -- it was like seeing a ghost. Then she blinked twice. Ohhh, Kawarimi, right. Fubuki slowly got up and sighed, now all her clothes were wet - great.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Which is just short for.. uh
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Idiot

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It defeats the purpose...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Rei-Li, Deo, Turo.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: And Kat.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, Tora sounds cooler.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Tora works.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Do you not like Turo?

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Turo is cool, but wouldn't it make sense if-- well... if he's Deo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, you have to be Ven cause Turo is too close to Tora and it'd get confusing.

  <font color = white>&#34;Haven&#39;t seen anyone doing any combat training.&#34;</font> The young man sat on the ground comfortably and crossed one leg over his knee.

  <font color = white>&#34;Who wants to spar?&#34;</font> Yurei would be the first to officially make a challenge on the platform, smiling with casual energy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: But 'Turo' and 'Tora' could be a cool team up name...

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hey Yurei. I'd be down but we already know you'd beat me haha.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: You never know.

     <font color = white>&#34;Any rules? Limitations?&#34;</font>

With that said, he made his way to the majorly vacant center of the arena. </font></font></font>

  <font color = white>&#34;A Uchiha. .I thought they were supposed to be real strong.&#34;</font> He seems to blink a centimeter before looking to Katora.

   <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a practice battle, I&#39;m not sure what you want me to tell you.&#34;</font> Yurei stands and crosses his arms.</font></font></font>
