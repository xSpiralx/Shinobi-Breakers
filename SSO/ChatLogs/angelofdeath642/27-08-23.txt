 <font color = white>&#34;Hehehe, yeah! My papa said you have to kill the prey, always!&#34;</font> He shouted.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0099cc>Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) shrugs her shoulders as it seemed everyone was day dreaming. Working hard on their statue style stance it seemed. Kind of sucked but then she heard someone speak up.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh alright just follow me.&#34;</font> She said, looking over at the Crimson haired girl</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) asks: Do you actually fish?

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry about that, what is your name if I may ask?&#34;</font> She said softly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0099cc>Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) firmly wraps her grip around the fishing pole while gazing out at the waters surface. Watching the shadows of of fish below dance around the surface of the water. Getting a feel for where she wanted to cast out to while the crimson girl got her self together.

<font color = white>&#34;You may and my name is Lizzie.&#34;</font> She said, smiling softly before casting her line out. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6f0000>Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) Her eyes had shifted over towards the girl before speaking towards her with a slight smile upon her face as she focused on where she wanted to throw her rod at.. the girl wasn&#39;t physically strong at all.. however she appeared to have smarts to her at the very least.

<font color = white>&#34;It is a pleasure, my name is Autumn&#34;</font> She said softly. <font color = white>&#34;It is a pleasure to meet you Lizzie. Hopefully we are placed on a team together. I think it would be cool to have someone to talk to.&#34;</font> She said softly towards her giggling a bit.</font></font></font>
