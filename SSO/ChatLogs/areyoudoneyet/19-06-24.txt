<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I could use a subordinate.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) Nods his head. <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think the rocks needed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: I hope it doesn't become like, a habitual thing... Seeing people die, not the spending money to make me feel better.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mhm..it was like..swamo swushh
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Does he even have 500 ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Don't take the bet, it's a set up.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Should you retain the victory.&#34;</font> The boy&#39;s glare never subsided, though it does seem to lack its signature, greed fueled gleam.

<font color = white>&#34;And if I am rendered the victor, I will only accept the sum.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmmm
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Not exactly, Tsuneko. It would be with Fubuki about.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Swamo swush?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: As we can see, she is not.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: I can't say it's the answer to everything. But, sometimes you need to find an other path to direct your emotions.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would jump into a stance and playfully swing her arm from left to right infront of her...while making sound effects.

<i>voowamm!</i>

<font color = white>&#34;mhm!...and in an instant..i think..it was...u-um...pretty graphic...to say the least..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Can I ask what your path is? Was?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Fubuki?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: You sayin' she's got tha' rest of yer' money?
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: That's how you keep a leveled head. And my path is simply to remind myself of my goal when moments get tough. Why did I take this burden and what do I get out of it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) pulls at his hair.

<font color = white>&#34;She currently holds... An amount that is greater than five-hundred ryo. If you wish to raise beyond five-hundred... We&#39;ll need to participate with her present.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) looked on in awe. What skill! What technique! What form!

<font color = white>&#34;Graphically cool!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: You might lean left or right on subjects, but sticking to your own goal is one thing that helps me keep clear.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Remember, last time you bet with him, he didn't have enough to cover his loss...
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: My goal... And why I'm taking the burden...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-ah...right! i cant be distracted...after me chobina and Choume follow me 
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: I know it's vague but it's simple enough for me to not be swayed into other paths.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: How did you find a goal that mattered? Like, right now I just want to be rich and famous but... That's not a heroes goal...
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: And that's what I wanna be. You know?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [ops..chonamu' this is what i get for multitasking!]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would move to follow Ume. <font color = white>&#34;Come on bro!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) looks over to Shadow Feather and nods his head. He follows after the girls.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: What, you wanted it to be something noble like "Save the people and free the world", hmm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirls her lengthy black hair as she pondered the thought. Honestly she&#39;d have thought this through much more, but her train of thought was interrupted not once, but twice already due to certain circumstances involving their higher-ups.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s very tempting ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she said, looking toward Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;But she&#39;s right. The last ante we had.. well you didn&#39;t quite honour that. You did show me some cash before but yer&#39; track record doesn&#39;t really uh.. inspire confidence. This is a -big- bet, ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Hehe, maybe?
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: I mean you can lie to yaself all you want. But I saved those farms and small towns because how the hell was I gonna survive if I ain't have no food?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Sides getting hooked on gamlin' ain't a good thing, my man.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Selfish, yes. But good came from it.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: So- There's nothing wrong with... a more selfish goal? As long as good comes from it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) looks around. Everyone was gone. . </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns from the library.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: In my opinion. Yes. A hero who wants to save other people to be free is selfish. They're forcing the world into a version of safe in their way only afterall.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Now, some shit is just evil and need to be wiped out. But anything beside those cases.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Huh... So even heroes are selfish in a way... I never thought about it like that.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: You know, you're super wise, Old Man Tooki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) heads back off the bench and to the area he tended to see all of the others. A few people seemed to be hanging in the street, and a few off to the sides.

Seemed like business as usual to him, though he was unaware of something might be going on. He waves to the group and stands idly by. Just in case there was a gathering for a reason</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Heheh. There's truly no one way to handle a situation. Someone will always think negative of it, ya pops probably thought that was the right thing to do, ya know?
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: I-I'm not sure about *that*... He's the Iron Vessel after all... I want to believe that it wasn't even him who did that. That it was that... thing inside of him....
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Ya know, I don't trust those things... But hey, I'm just a simple villager.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Nah, you're not just some simple or random villager. You're Old Man Tooki.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Damn right!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) took a quick sip of something hidden up his sleeve.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) smiles and nods toward the old man. Raising a hand up to pat him lightly on the shoulder while saying,

<font color = white>&#34;I feel a ton better. Thank you, old man.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) simply unveiled three-hundred ryo, counting each individual bill arduously in front of the young Uchiha.
Well--actually, on top of her head. <font color = white>&#34;I would expect you of anyone to understand the weight this... <i>demurral</i> entails.&#34;</font> One hundred Ryo.

The Zhu slowed down his count, moving further and further into a more visceral tone when he spoke, <font color = white>&#34;There is value within these mere paper marks. Indeed, such an amount--I believe your tongue for it would represent... Divinity? Roughly of course, though I would be astonished for you to recognize such a phrase.&#34;</font> One-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;Merely, in a triviality--it would represent a net gain for you, would it not?&#34;</font> Two-Hundred.
<font color = white>&#34;Just a simple game that you have succeeded in many a process.&#34;</font> Two-Twenty-Five. <font color = white>&#34;<i>What is to prevent you from....</i>&#34;</font> Two-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Complete and utter dominion?</b>&#34;</font>Two-Seventy-Five.

With twenty-five ryo in hand, the boy places it a the Uchiha girl&#39;s nose.
<font color = white>&#34;Defeat me. That provides one-thousand Ryo. And any form of assistance you would comprise.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm here for you all, youngster.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: So- What's even going on over there...? Meixun are you really gonna risk being her slave just to keep gambling?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) turns his head toward Meixun.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) took another sip of something and knocked himself right out! The liqour bottle was now emptied and Tooki can sleep soundly.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: How much more do you need?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Flame in the eyes, determination, etcetera. Not actual flames. No... you youngsters with elemental ninjutsu would be troublesome.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just three-hundred left.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: C'mere Fubuki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked up to Hideo. <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) reaches into his pocket and produces a very crumpled wad of, what was probably, three-hundred ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Here, get a super cool sword.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at the wad of money and immediately shaked her head while waving her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;No, you don&#39;t need to do it really! I appeciate it but like, it&#39;s a lot.&#34;</font> Fubuki spoke quickly due to being flustered, it was an unexpectedly cool moment from Hideo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and gestures with the money again,

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, spending money makes me happy.&#34;</font>

Lowering the money slightly he smiles. How blessed was he that getting money was his primary goal solely because spending it made him happier... He, however, does not miss an opportunity to be slightly snide,

<font color = white>&#34;Even though you&#39;re sometimes mean and lame. You <i>do</i> need a sword so you can actually fight and stuff. All I need is my dad to stop being lazy and teach me jutsu.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Aw, Hideo's being noble.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm always noble!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched her head while thinking about it, she couldn&#39;t even jokingly bully him. So many people had already helped her and she couldn&#39;t help people back. Eventually she caved in and sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay fine. I accept it if you insist. But for my next katana I&#39;ll try to make the money on my own -- and if you need ANY help, you ask me. You got that?&#34;</font>

She stepped forward and put her hands on her hips, looking at him seemingly upset though her face betrayed her intentions, which were just being serious about her promise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (GRAHHH)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) nods his head and hands her the money, <font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;m immediately calling in my favor; be less mean to me.&#34;</font>

With that handled, he spins to face the old man. Using his still out-stretched hand, now freed of money, to point at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I totally heard you say us having elemental jutsu would be &#39;troublesome&#39;! I&#39;m gonna learn to throw fireballs <b>and</b> mountains and it&#39;ll be the complete opposite of troublesome! It&#39;ll be... helpful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately nodded and grabbed the money, putting it alongside her stash. Just enough for the katana she had ordered.

<font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;ll only be mean if you&#39;re mean to me though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Damn, I guess that's fair.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I appreciate the donation but I won't become a punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have my word I won't start shit though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I would never treat you like one! I'm usually the punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Heh, true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Trust me man I may laugh and smile but it tooootallly sucks most of the time.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If it makes you feel better, I was always joking. Sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, I figured. Thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think Tsuneko may be the only one that actually means it... I 'unno.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nah, she's messing with you too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I don't think anyone actually hates anyone else here.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hrm, I hope so.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) rested his good eye on Hideo while the other glances at Fubuki. He&#39;d let out a troubled sigh as he thought about his days of fighting against ninjutsu.

<font color = white>&#34;Helpful how?&#34;</font>, he questioned as he removed a glass from his sleeve and quickly took a sip.

<font color = white>&#34;You youngsters are something else.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I 'unno I figure throwing mountains could probably help someone somehow. Lemmie get there first. I'll worry about what I do when I'm there, when I'm there!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, very true.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw the man look at them each with a separate eye and couldn&#39;t get that mental image out of her mind. It just might be more traumatizing than yesterday.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, what would be helpful then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Maybe someone will ask me to relocate a mountain range or something heroic like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like, literally carving a path through the mountains or something. That'd probably be super helpful.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Took much plate shifting with cause an earthquake.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'll make the earth stop moving, easy.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hey, I'd be the one carving through the mountains with my sword.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Swords.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fair. But I bet I could just like... rip chunks out of the mountain super easy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Carve a valley with my barehands...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like diggin' through sand at the beach...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) asks: My idea of being helpful is selfish. I would make sure I'd use ninjutsu to protect the crops and livestock! How could I sleep with a full stomach if there's no food?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah but that's like- obvious stuff! I thought wanted unique examples or something!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm a simple man.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: My way of being helpful will be cutting down anyone who attacks us.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) had a delusional smile on his face as he remembered the cheers of the crowds that gathered around him.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Ahh, yes...

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Mm, the small stuff is usually glanced over until those things are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh I guess that's true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I guess all the small stuff would probably be good training too right?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Damn right, if you're going to reach your -goal- then you're gonna have to leave no stone unturned.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think it might be literal stones when it comes to doton training.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, I see what you did there.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Say, Old Man Tooki, what kinds of stuff did you do when you were 'cleaning up the streets'?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was full of energy and brimming with taijutsu mastery.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was gaining experience left and right, finishing fights fast.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) swiftly sent two strikes Eastward. Loud pops from joints, muffled by cloth, bounced from off the mountains.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had only the vaguest understanding of taijutsu basics, if even that. So just seeing two punches performed was enough to convince him.

<font color = white>&#34;A whole ten of us?! Are you sure? Some of us are actually scary strong. Like Katora or Yurei. Buuuuut barring them damn you probably could&#39;ve!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Woah, he actually does know stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: What a time it was to be alive... I think out of fifty, there's only been two farms that were too much to save.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Whoa really? What happened to them?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Too much ninjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: I was completely outclassed!

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I need ninjutsu...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: At that point, I think I reached the peak of taijutsu. Swiftness helped me avoid certain things to close in.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wonder how fast I have to throw a mountain for someone to be unable to just... avoid it with swiftness...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Depends on the person.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Doesn't have to be something time consuming. You could sew, make clothing for others, stuff like that.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmmm
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I could offer protection
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: For 50 ryo a week I won't beat anyone up
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Neither will my gang.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: You? Offer protection? From what? A stiff breeze?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: That's extorsion.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Crimelord is a crazy choice.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: And if you try beating me up I'll beat you up with my stick.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Well we could beat ya' up and find out what we'd protect you from, Hideo
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You couldn't beat me up. I'm destined for greatness.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Stick?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, until I get a katana.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: My fire style will burn through any stick.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Reilin.  Recruit Fubuki.  And then gang up on Hideo.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: What fire style?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: --
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: S-shut up, Red.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm not being recruited, and I'll bonk you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Heheh.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh, nice empty threat...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: It's not empty!

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Empty like Meixun's wallet.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Who's in your gang Reilin?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: You'll find out!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Ah, so no one yet.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Try beating me in the obstacle course, if you can.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: Pick which one o' ya is gettin' a beat-down!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: And when we're done we're takin' 50 ryo for protection for the next week
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's illegal I think.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Nah. Katora said it was a trade
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: We trade protection for ryo
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's a crime, yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Crime?...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Anything's legal if the law doesn't catch wind.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah it's illegal.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) looked at Katora for clarification.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If I say no you can't legally beat me up.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: See.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Anything is legal.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: True.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Just got to be good at covering your tracks.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I dunno, Fubuki.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: If it's like three of us versus one of you and you say no? Well uh
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Democracy.. Three votes yes
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Okay but like, that's lame.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Super lame.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If you wanna be a coward and beat me up go ahead.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I mean I'm not letting you do it for free but yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Don't be complainin' ta' me. That's what ya' pay for our protection fer'.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I have to pay you, so that you, will stop being lame?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's lame.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: You're gettin' it~
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You should pay me to make me pay you.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: HUH?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yep.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Fifty ryo and I'll pay your fifty ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Pay me to pay you to stop being lame so you don't have to pay me to pay you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Cause you won't be lame in the first place so you wouldn't need to pay me to pay you to stop being lame.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) blinked a few times, trying to do the math in her head to see if that made any sense.

Imaginary numbers and numeric symbols floating about.

<font color = white>&#34;I pay her to pay me....&#34;</font> she reiterated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Egh... This is makin' me feel queasy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You're bad at keeping track of numbers. Just trust Fubuki and I on this.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: S-so..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: When do I get paid then?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Gotta spend money to make money Reilin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll pay you after you pay me.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ohh
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Give her fifty so she can give you fifty to leave her alone. So you'll have gained fifty.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Exactly.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: And if I do that for both that's 100!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Now you're getting it!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hehehe, this'll be easy.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'll be drownin' in cash.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wait-
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: We've changed her from an extortionist to a loan shark...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: About the same thing.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I dunno what an exhibitionist is
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's an art thing.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: But loan shark sounds badass
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) pointed at Hanaka.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He's an exhibitionist.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Oh
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ew
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: Ew.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Weren't you the one who was fine with people peeping on others?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Reilin...  But they're paying you YOUR money that you paid them.  So collectively you're getitng 0.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: I was tha' one who said sometihn' about it!
<br><font color=teal>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: You were the one who said it was fien
<br><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: No no, the other girl.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I never said it was fine. I bonked someone's eye for peeping.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s brows furrowed contemplatively as she heard Tsuneko. The Uchiha fell silent as her eyes darted from left at a moderate pace. Clearly dwelling on the thought for a moment.

She even counted on her fingers some. <font color = white>&#34;Heeeeeyy....&#34;</font> she came to her conclusion.

<font color = white>&#34;She&#39;s right! If I got 50... And give -you- 50 then I&#39;m at zero.. An&#39; you give it -back- I&#39;m just right back where I started!&#34;</font> she pointed toward Fubiki and Hideo in a accusory manner. <font color = white>&#34;You two are -bad- at math!&#34;</font> she did not think they were pulling one over her, but merely that their math was off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: I never said that I was fine with it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at Tsuneko a bit frustated before sighing, her gaze directed towards the loan shark.

<font color = white>&#34;That was the point, to fool you! But then SHE--&#34;</font> Fubuki pointed at Tsuneko who was literally right next to her, <font color = white>&#34;--ruined it all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You better not be fine with it or I'll poke your eye, with a stick.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: !
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: Y-you mean you -tried- to fool me?!

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Earning ryo's all about meeting the people's demand. Find out what they want and make them pay for it. 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) asks: Why would you poke my eye now?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: 'Course I did. In fact I didn't try, I did do it.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'd poke it so you wouldn't peep.
