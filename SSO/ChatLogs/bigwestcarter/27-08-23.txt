<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) looked at Gilly for a second for a second skin as blue as the water he shrugged for a moment as he looked at the kid and then to Sora he started to wonder how the 14 years wasn&#39;t an genin.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh Interesting so we&#39;ll all behind haha, i join late too.&#34;</font> he stated as he prepared the path of becoming a ninja rather than being a cook like his dad.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) To be fair, Gilly didn&#39;t know how old he was. Being only 4&#39;7 and having such soft fish features, one could assume he was anywhere between five and ten. Eitherway, he shrugs his shoulders grinning.
 <font color = white>&#34;Four and teen? That&#39;s pretty old!&#34;</font> 

 He looks over at E nodding. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re four and teen too!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: It was black haired girl which talked weird stuff like mating
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Was it Reimi?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) quickly covered his mouth as he seem to be gross out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: ..Man what were you guys talking about.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: I think that is something to be jailed for.
