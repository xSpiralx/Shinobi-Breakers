Too easy, Shishorama was probably the most simple person here when it came to being very predictable... The Uchiha would watch as more and more stepped up, a group pooling over time.

Wondering if he should also step up, but he wondered what the Headmaster really meant by elements... What was involved? Most whom stepped up were more durable or stronger from looking by a glance.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Runs up to the mountain and limbers up for a moment getting ready. Wasting no time he jumps up upon the side of the mountain and grabs onto the rocks. A quick glance was given to those who stepped up as well, some girl with white hair and a kid who's name was...Try? That didn't matter, now was not the time to get distracted.

focusing back onto the rock he'd start his climb, his first real moment of the academy. determined not to make a fool of himself the young man doesn't focus on being fast or first, but on consistency. Maybe he wouldn't get to the top first, but he was damn sure going to get there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) pointed at the mountain.

- <font color = white>&#34;All I have to do is beat it up, right?&#34;</font>

Momoko instead moved back and walked to the nearest lake, kneeling close to it, getting a handfull of water and splashing it across her face. She got up, dusted herself off, took her sandals off, set them aside, and looked right back up at the TALL mountain.

Momoko held her fists back, and started to accumulate momentum. . .

Beginning to utilize the infamous Super Peel Out, Trademarked, catching up with speed and boosting at high-mach towards the Mountain! Her hand shot back,

dramatically reaching out towards the rock, with a blitz effect covering up her POV, flames erupting out of her fingertips, GRIPPING on one rock-hard surface!

Momoko started to punch the mountain&#39;s walls, beginning to climb at a ridiculously fast pace, surpassin-

no, wait, she hasn&#39;t even gotten one meter above the ground. Momoko is scratching the surface at comically high speeds and going nowhere, because physics decided they&#39;d specifically fuck her over.

She looks like a feral cat trying to get over some curtains.</font></font></font>

He moved over to his sister, <font color = white>&#34;Time to make up for having me miss my chance last time.&#34;</font> He hinted, eyeing the woman&#39;s blade once again.

&#39;<i>If I can stomach the shock from touching her blade.... I can probably...&#34; The boy&#39;s mute-red hues kept a close gaze, calculating his chances.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) looked at her brother.

<font color = white>&#34;You will throw me up. Then, I will catch you from the top.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Towa (The ashen haired girl-ZenchuZaaRachu) would instead watch for a short while. She wore glasses and held books close to her chest. And darted her eyes across the field upon seeing most of her peers climbing the rock.

She decided to give it an attempt, definately soon.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn't want to use his strength to get a stick but climbing was another thing entirely. He thought that he might as well go ahead and see what he can do when it comes to climbing. He was pretty strong and agile, but beyond that, he lacked in almost every other aspect.

Patting his hands together, he was a bit confused of how to go about it at first, and figured he would just jump for the first big rock he could see. Easily managing to make use of his upper body strength to pull himself up... only to dangle for a few moments trying to find a proper foothold for his feet... well that was a bit embarassing.

Still, he found a spot after a few tries and afterwards, it was bit like smooth sailing till halfway up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Alright! 
<br><font color=teal>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) whispers faintly.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) draws a long, slow blink before peering up the mountain side. Its large and dangerous crevice would surely be the death of them if one person slipped or failed to grab the right place.

<font color = white>&#34;You should throw me instead and I will catch you.&#34;</font> He doesn&#39;t want to slip and fall to his doom. She was prone to sweat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Good thinking Try.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Listeeeen.

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Climbing mountain is a difficult task for most, but Konohagakure Shinobi aren't the average beings. Conquer this and you'll be one step away from earning your bands.
<br><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) narrowed her gaze momentarily, before assuming a careful stance. Her arms are read to grab at his own, and her legs are bent to roll her frame downward to catapult him upward.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay.&#34;</font> The girl replied, bidding him to get a running start.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) gave up trying to climb using her hands.

Momoko walked away and instead approached the closest tree - aggressively kicking the base of it.

A conveniently large-sized tree branch fell off, stabbing the floor beneath her. She is NOT using her brains nor is she trying to use teamwork at all, she's just bashing her face first into it and hoping it works.

And by that, she's now going to use the stick as a trampoline, aligning it just right. She read it in comics, certainly, it can work.

Momoko jumped towards the wall, kicked off it, and dived straight into the stick.  . .

<i>tic</i>.

Only for it to snap like a twig, anticlimatically resulting in nothing happening.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) locked his fingers together with his palms facing upwards and turned his back to the cliff. He didn't need to be the first one up to the next stage of the mountain; this wasn't a race. This was a group effort, and every group needed an anchor! He scanned those gathered for who might take the launch.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) shrugged, that was as good a plan as any he supposed, so he hopped onto the cheerful lad&#39;s back. All they had to do was... get over the mountain by any means.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kohaku of the Uchiha by the way, I hope you&#39;re good at climbing... I am not.&#34;</font> The boy affirmed, knowing his strength lies with using his chakra.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Climbing rocks isn't so hard if you plan it out before you start.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Push with your legs, don't use your arms to try to pull yourself up.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: And use your core to keep your body close to the cliff!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) began pushing his sister over between the mountain and Komo.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mooon, you owe me anyway, just help me out witth this okay?&#34;</font> He begs, taking another glance at the Chuunin in hopes she doesn&#39;t walk off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) || Climb up that mountain? It looks more like a plateau. How in the world is he going to do this? And more importantly- How is he going to get the others up there as well? 

He watched as everyone grappled with their own approaches, attempting various methods to conquer the vertical terrain. And then, as if a puzzle piece snapping into place, an idea took shape in his mind. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, the cogs of his mind whirring.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm. . .&#34;</font> He mused aloud. A lightbulb flickered above his head as an idea finally kicked in, he projected his voice even louder.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, folks!&#34;</font> His tone raised, hoping that everyone would heed his words.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s take turns giving each other a boost, and then use the human chain we create to pull up the stragglers. We&#39;ll make it together that way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: But I don't have any chains.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is glad this was so readily accepted. The pale student moves himself back, as close to the water as he can manage without risk of slipping and falling in before suddenly charging forward.

With the running start he will draw closer to his sister before anticipating where she holds the flats of her palm, awaiting the leverage to send him skyward with a press of the foot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With utmost confidence, Shishorama stands tall and unwavering before the formidable mountain. She flexes her fingers, producing a satisfying crackling sound, and rotates her neck to loosen any tension before taking a determined step forward. Despite being presented with a daunting task, she took it upon herself to undergo it. 

Shisho charges towards the towering rock formation. As she approaches, she reaches out to touch its rugged surface, feeling the rough texture under her fingertips. Though the task seems daunting, with nothing but her own strength and unwavering resolve, she sets out to climb it, determined to conquer the daunting challenge.

With a steady pace and an unwavering smile, she ascends the mountain, pushing herself to her natural limits. The sweat on her face and the strain in her muscles are clear signs of the effort she is putting into the climb. Nevertheless, she refuses to be defeated by the physical toll and makes her way to the top.

<font color = white>&#34;ARGGHHHHH!&#34;</font> The intense young woman <b>ROARS</b> at the top of her lungs once the pinnacle had been reached, claiming her victory among the students that remained at the bottom of the rocky formation. 

<font color = white>&#34;HERE STANDS, SENJU SHISHORAMA! SUCCESSOR OF THE WILL OF FFIIIIIIRRREEEEE!!!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) , with his hands still linked together to provide a boost and his back to the cliff face turned and looked to the late bloomer. <font color = white>&#34;Great idea! I&#39;ll boost you up first, then you can help pull them up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) asks: What do you need me to do?
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: Alright, that's one- There's two.
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) asks: Anyone else want in?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I can push or I can go up and pull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) struck with perfect timing, suggesting that these acrobatic feats were practiced often-- or else, the pair shared some instinctual link, giving them the sort of frame-perfect coordination required to achieve this. Either way, in one graceful, fluid motion the girl rolled and the boy was boosted, propelled by both palms and feet high into the air; he'd be able to make it up for sure.

The dancer, for her part, is quick to get off the ground and brush the dirt from her clothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: In>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) stared at the bloodly samurai that just snapped a branch from the tree. She points to the ground before speaking.

<font color = white>&#34;If ya&#39;ll get hurt or something, just use nature&#39;s bandaid. Rub some dirt on it.&#34;</font>

She said, as she examined the other groups. Some were trying to work together, not a bad plan. Probably the most easiest way to complete a task, however it depends on the core strengths of the members for it to be a success.
  Komo would step her way around the groups of academy students, plugging her ears when she made her way by the Intense Senju, watching him head to the top of the mountain.

  Clan strength was truly something else...

She watched as others adopted the samurai&#39;s tactics, using their surroundings to climb such a object.

<font color = white>&#34;Resourceful.&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: Either role works, just that I'll be counting on the physically strongest to reel in the rest.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) Although the Uchiha hand't found a good spot to continue to climbing, he managed to see one just out of reach. He had an idea of what to do and wanting to show himself capable, he tried to get to it straight away...but... there was some hesitation as he would need to jump and be airborne for a moment, if he missed, he was screwed.

The fall wasn't THAT great though, so with his heart speeding up, he took a deep breath and made a leap, hands shooting forward eagerly, almost desperately for the crevice that would allow him to continue on.

Afterwards, he had to take a few deep breaths to calm down and continued on! Now he wasn't as a fraid as before, and just as he was about to reach the top, he heard Shishorama's screams of excitement.

He was just a bit too late for it. Well, next time!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) looked up towards the cliffside with a gulp.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow.&#34;</font> he says softly, tugging at his collar. They&#39;d look around to the others, looking for reactions perhaps. He had hoped to see others as worried as he was, hoping to not seem TOO out of place with his fear of heights.

<font color = white>&#34;O-okay!&#34;</font> he said, marching towards the mountain now. He studied the rock&#39;s face with intensity, planning his way before actually even trying. They saw nooks and crannies that would potentially fit his hands and feet. After awhile of putting together a strategy, he&#39;d move!

One hand stretched up first, his foot following after as it placed itself in a crack along the rocks. Not even ten feet up he&#39;d look down, eyes becoming wide as he saw the ground below.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh...&#34;</font> he sighed, looking back up now. contiuing the climb with a slow pace. He wouldn&#39;t rush it, just knowing he only had to reach the top and wasn&#39;t asked to do so with haste. Finally, he would grasp a hand on the top of the cliff, pulling himself up to the top shakily. 

<font color = white>&#34;I-I did it!&#34;</font> he&#39;d roar, looking down the cliffside before fainting, falling on his backside from the fear it had induced!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I can pull then.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll go up first.
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I can pull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Climbing climbing climbing this was turning out to be easier than expected, but then again what kid didn&#39;t like to climb on things? Despite this being labeled as official training it was nothing new to the young kid. He had spent many days in the past running around the village and climbing to places he probably shouldn&#39;t have.

Reaching out with his hand and pushing up with his legs, a boundless stamina allowed the kid to continue up the mountain with little trouble, it was only about passing the halfway point did he hear Shishorama yell out....damn she had beaten him. Oh well, it didn&#39;t matter. 

Reaching the top of the first track he looks back and only now realizes how high up they really were....perhaps this was a bit different from the school yard. Regardless he yells down 

<font color = white>&#34;Right I&#39;ll help anyone else up &#34;</font> he offers to the ones below.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I like pulling things.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: . . .She clocked out again.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: More and more of you are getting to the top... Maybe this mountain isn't tall enough.
<br><font color=red>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yakeru(The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) OOCs: (continuing*)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Yea my bad. I was focusing on giant robot fights.
<br><font color=green>*Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: Now... how do I jump that high...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is launched and that, folks, was all that she wrote. His slight frame coupled with quantum mechanics and some other shit leads to him getting to a pretty solid place on the mountain. Yet, with a particularly large rock he will have to cling to in order to hold on.

His arm is over the base of it and all of his strength is used to keep himself there. Thus, he turns, <font color = white>&#34;Jump now.&#34;</font> Otherwise it will be for nothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#884250>Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) gives a beaming smile and turns towards the mountain, not entirely paying attention to formalities <font color = white>&#34;That crevasse will make a decent spot!&#34;</font> he states excitedly, not wanting to expend too much energy for when he comes to collect others.
 He beings to climb using the crack, leisurely climbing as he hums a tune..  Untill he starts to stagger a bit quickly checking up on the Uchiha on his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Make sure to hold on as tight as ya can!&#34;</font> He shouts and before long.. with a few near stumbles, but a generally calm climb, the two make it up beside the others at the top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: I was asleep.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Hey Shishorama, how about we go down there? I wonder how far up we can help boost someone up if we do it toegether.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Oh, good idea!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: It's my duty to help them up!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That is correct.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) starts to climb down... well, that oughta be easier than climbing up, surely... right?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: Hurry.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Half the task is getting up there, the second one is getting the rest of the class there too.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: You heard Sensei, if one fails we all fail.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: ...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clapped her hands, the noise a resounding acknowledgement of his words. She's got a target to leap to and intends to make it there. A quick look around found her a branch, and the little eleven year old wielded it with impossible strength as she took a step back and then ran forward. Her pole finds the sandy ground of the river bank and lets her careen forward. Deftly, she jumped from it, and one small arm found itself reaching.

She grabbed at his wrist, thudding into the mountain harshly. 

That should have hurt, but she didn't make a sound. Moments later, she's found herself some footholds, and they've got a signfiicant headstart on the mountain.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) put his plan into motion. Leaning his back against the wall and adopting a squatting stance, he formed his hands into a makeshift platform, ready to serve as a human springboard. This would give the more physically capable members, the Samurai and the Youth a chance to utilize their strength not just to gain height, but also to secure a grip on a ledge, providing a sturdy foundation for their climb.

If the pieces fell into place as hoped, the Samurai and the Youth would lift him up next, a sequence that would repeat as they ascended. His own role came next  using his position as a link, connecting the chain formed by the others. Depending on their willingness and ability, either the Youth or the Samurai could be the anchor and hook.

He acknowledged that not everyone would be on the same wavelength as him, so he proceeded with those who were on the same page. His personal charisma might influence some, but he understood its limits.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (does anyone know if there's a doc with the combat rules
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: so we got to get up there...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Just hold up a moment, we'll be right down there to help ya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;--&#34;</font>

Shun&#39;Ichi shot his sister a scathing glare, mouthing inaudibly an <i>I&#39;ll do it myself</i> in her general direction before taking a glance to the mountain.

Three problems would arise, well--two and a half problems. First, there&#39;s no chance he&#39;s proficient enough to climb the mountain with these heavy clothes, and he doesn&#39;t have spares to replace them with--so no chance in a quick change.
Second: Komo&#39;s sword being flowed with some sort of chakra, being completely unaware of how chakra functions, the punk&#39;s simply going to have to go through with counteracting that... Somehow. 
He spits in his hands, rubbing the saliva together in order to produce an adequate amount of friction for the rough mountain walls to feel less abrase. In any case, the half problem comes to what Komo&#39;ll do if he&#39;s successful.

Assuming he&#39;ll even get close to grabbing her blade from the top of the mountain.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, climbing, that&#39;s easy... Yeah...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We're starting a chain.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We'll boost up and pull others up.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: You guys can be the next level up.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Oh! Nice idea.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Those who lack strength can get the most help.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The stronger ones can come up after!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Get on the chain you three on the back.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) clumsily rushes down the cliff face. After reaching the half-way point, she slips on a rock and tumbles down a flight. With a loud oof, the girl splatters against the stone ground. Bleeding from her skull as she was, she eagerly hopped to her fellow students and extended a steady hand to whoever might be needing assistance!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll help you! I&#39;ll help all of you!&#34;</font> She beams proudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) sat down and thinks. It was ethier let someone carry him up there or just fail.<font color = white>&#34;Uh  guess I sit here and wait..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll hang out in the middle until we get everyone up.
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) just reduced their health by a cost of Light Damage - 3 / 6
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) offered a helping hand to the chill young boy. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: That second ledge will be a little bit harder.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Leans down now and lays flat upon the mountain to steady himself as much as possible. Taking off his coat he quickly ties it to a nearby rock to anchor himself. Once all the set he leans over to the two white haired students below him.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright just get to me and I&#39;ll help pull you up&#34;</font> he calls down to them. It was a good idea Try had to help others out, and he could see even now the others were coming down to help as well. The class just might make it to the top.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We can go together.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: Fine...
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: We should dig up some dirt and push it against the cliffside for slightly higher ground to start with.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Remember! It's not a race but a team effort!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) Momoko dusted her hands off, took a few steps back, and hopped once - The momentum of her fall being used to start a jog, and soon a sprint, running straight up into the Bloomer's trampoline -

Getting leverage to LEAP up high into the next 'floor'.

Her hand reached out to the Overconfident Kid, trying to hold and hang to him!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) get's lifted up and followed the busy browed guy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) doesn't allow her to thud at all, in actuality. When she's snatched onto his extended hand, gripping him by the wrist the boy seems to swing with all of his momentuous strength (which wasn't much) and hurls the pale haired girl higher.

Oh baby, it was ice climbers time.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled his scarf off from around his neck and tied it around his waist. He offered the other end to the chill young boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Are you sure?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll go up and you can come up behind me.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: Right..
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We've got someone at the bottom boosting people up and someone at the top to take our hands.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: We'll get there together! Yos!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) continued her observation of the students making their way to the top, some finally realizing the second part of this lesson. However, this exercise could be a little tough for the first day; but many of them already proved her wronng.
She held her staff close as some even got a few scratches along the way.

Komo's eyes were like an eagle, peering at every situation that could happen. Her thumb rubbing against the hilt of her staff - Red staining her thumb print as well as the hilt's steel end.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was kneeling by the edge together with Shishorama, just waiting for the first person that would be sent that way. The moment the first one came, he immediately reached out to firmly grab the hand of that samurai and pull them up on the second floor. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, now let&#39;s boost you up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) holded the tie. This was going to be ethier fine or a rough day.<font color = white>&#34;Damm be careful man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) opened an eyem,

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh okay...&#34;</font> he gulped, looking back down the cliffside before trying to climb back down. He aimmed to join the student made totem pole, trying to allow the others an express route up the cliffside along the others.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t let me fall!&#34;</font> he says, gripping onto the stone&#39;s face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaoru(The late bloomer-SonikkuX) OOCs: (Alright, the order is Samurai > Bushy Brows > Me and whoever else jumps up with us)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yakeru(The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) OOCs: (Eye)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) safely landed, now instead, keeping the grip she had. She looked down at the Bloomer and the Dweeb -

Stretching her hand out to them, leaning in to the edge of the cliff! She's going to catch anybody that springs up to her height.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) is caught off guard, flying upward with a hefty momentum. Arms and legs scramble as she makes it just short of the edge, both arms grabbing onto a rocky outcropping. There&#39;s even more scrambling, as her grip shifts from two arms to two legs wrapped around the out-jutting, earth spike. She hung upside down like a monkey, arms both held out to catch her brother.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re going to the top.&#34;</font>

She could easily make it there from here, after all.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) took the boost step the late bloomer offered, planting his foot between his linked fingers before stepping up and taking the added height. He reached up and grabbed handholds in the cliff face with his rough and calloused fingers before peering around for a good route.

Thankfully, other students had already made the climb so he was beginning to see the path best to take. With a final cinch on the scarf at his waist Try looked down to the chill kid. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s just one step at a time.&#34;</font> He then began to work his way up, careful not to get too far from the chill kid in case something happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (is the ashen haired girl afk
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Ahhhhh dtdtdtdt... we stand on the shoulders of giants!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Look at Try! He's sure doing a lot!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: It's a team effort!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: You guys found the best routes to take. Now, we just have to follow your lead.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) moves to the only side that had no one to help. Since Try and the others had it covered. He moved to be on the left in case those white haired kids needed a hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm not sure how to help you right now, but I'm here if you need me!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We'll take the help when we get close.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: The scarf came in handy.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: The best tool is the one you've got, right?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: huh...well I suppose thats one way to get up.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: To think I'd learn a lesson here! I need to put that in my notes!
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I have hands.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) nods. <font color = white>&#34;To the top,&#34;</font> A unanimous decision, born from an already understood agreement that they did not need to be first. Simply that they needed to get there. So he will prepare himself mentally as she hangs from a point of leverage.

He jumps, pushing off of the large rock and closer to his counterpart. His hand extends, ready to grip.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) shook his head. Grabing the scarf he just followed his lead. Simple right? He did not look down just for his sake. Looking down would made it worse for himself. Literally he could not give up even if he wanted to. He was locked in with the busy browed. No going back.

<font color = white>&#34;Are we there yet...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Oooo, we're close buddy!
<br><font color=red>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=red>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=red>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) increases their chakra by Full - 18 / 18.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: It's just a bit further before you should be able to reach their hands.
<br><font color=red>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) increases their stamina by Full - 15 / 15.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: right...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) climbed up another few paces. He reached the midpoint between where he was previously and where Momoko and Shishorama were waiting with their hands outstretched. 

The dweeb was dirty and sweaty now with trickles of the stuff running down his temples and forehead to his masculine and handsome eyebrows where they were swept aside from his eyes as evolution intended. Try rubbed his head off his shoulder to scratch and itch and felt around for a hand hold he was confident in.

Once he felt secure he turned and looked down, breathing hard but feeling good. With one free hand he reached for the chill young boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) dug his palms into the mountain, feeling a rush of wind coming from the Kaguya duo gave him an idea... He let off a short hop, pinching the wall further as his legs stood parallel to his arms; he wondered if he could quickly switch position to dart up the wall backwards. Besides, given the amount of people congregating about, he can properly formulate a distraction adequate enough for him to compensate for his sister&#39;s lack of support.

He quips to himself on how quickly he darts, gaining a sense of confidence in his plan, he watches Komo&#39;s weapon as if it were prey, greediness hinted throughout his eyes, before he knew it, he was directly underneath the solemn youngster, accidentally grabbing ahold of the character&#39;s leg and losing some balance.

<font color = white>&#34;Shi--&#34;</font> He curses, quickly utilizing the youngster&#39;s weight to his advantage and flipping onto the first protrusion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod holding on as he was carried up- The distance from the ground got wider as the lad climbed, <font color = white>&#34;This would be easier if I could use my chakra to scale this thing.&#34;</font> He stated while looking down, while this happened he&#39;d just focus on molding his chakra for practice... No point in doing nothing while he was being hoisted into the air... One mountain side scale lead to another as he just looked down from above.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder how i would&#39;ve got up her without much climbing experience...&#34;</font> As he would eventually wonder how to help the others, <font color = white>&#34;Now how do I help them make their ways up here...&#34;</font> This would be easier wwith rope, maybe holding out his hand to help peole over the edge would be enough?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Once you can reach me you can reach them.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) caught him. There&#39;s no preservation of momentum, though that may have been easier. What followed was an almost impossible display core strength. Her legs remain hooked over the rock as if two heavy weights.  There&#39;s a look of focus and strain on her face as she used the power of her core to swing him back and forth, building up power with every sway until she&#39;s nearly teetering off her perch...

And then he&#39;s hurled skyward. As she freed him, she used this same momentum to mount the cropping she had wrapped herself around and jump to the next platform.

<font color = white>&#34;Watch out!&#34;</font> She called, to anyone who might be in the way of her flying brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watched the brother and sister, unable to help it, he nodded in admiration. <font color = white>&#34;Well damn, that&#39;s cool as hell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) eagerly awaited Try and company&#39;s approach. She was able to use this time wisely to regain her composure and strength enough to assist them when the time came.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re almost there! You guys are doing really good!&#34;</font> She cheered them on happily.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hey. We should fashion some rope together if we can.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I've got this scarf if anyone.. hn...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: else has something...
<br><font color=red>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) just reduced their stamina by a cost of D - 2 / 5
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: - I think the person behind me is wearing a scarf!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) caught the Bushy Dweeb with one single grasp, firmly holding him with little to no difficulty. Her muscles bulked, tensing as she grit her teeth, launching her head back to fully PULL him right down!

Now she&#39;d stretch her hand out to the chill young boy, alongside the bloomer.

- <font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mon. Jump. Do it.&#34;</font>

- <font color = white>&#34;If you ever, fall, just don&#39;t.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Wah!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) was coincidentally the unfortunate victim in the sibling duo's way, though his miniscule weight and strength would prove null to their cause, instead counteracting his own attempt to stay on the platform and knocking him airborne, tumbing down the mountain in a mixture of curses and whines.

Back to square one.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) gulped, slowly untying his scarf before handing it over.

Still it was almost like the punk was trying to pull him. Reguardless as his wrist was grabbed he&#39;d start to pull up bringing the Punk with him. only them to get knocked down...damn <font color = white>&#34;Push with your feet&#34;</font> he orders before turning to the side. 

<font color = white>&#34;Grab. My. Hand.&#34;</font> he calls out to the punk</font></font></font>

She quickly held out a single handseal as her chakra engulfed her feet. Komo seemingly disappeared out of sight, merely to reappearer to the end destination of the flying boy.
  Just the first day, she wasn't intending in doing paperwork to explain why one of the students was in the hospital wing...

The Chuunin would appear inbetween the punk with twin scarves and the pale red-eyed boy. Extending her arms towards each of them in the attempts to prevent such a collusion.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is certainly lacking in the department of core strength. No, his talents lie in the more acrobatic side of things. The impossible angles, the ease of access in which he could fit into cramped spaces, that sort of thing.

But as he billows through the air, momentum carrying him high, higher and to the highest peak their combined abilities could bring the both of them, he tucks and rolls into a standing finish when the time to land came.

He&#39;s covered in gravel and dirt but he was here. <font color = white>&#34;Can you jump?&#34;</font> He calls down to his sister! From this high even she would need some sort of miracle to simply clear the distance.

--, he turns to the cheerful one. <font color = white>&#34;Can you dangle me?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: I will hang and catch my sister. If you can.

With him being one of if not the last to get up, he proceeded to. . .Walk away?

He needed to make some distance, is all. He simply needed to 'wind up' before he begins moving.

He builds up a massive amount of speed, running swiftly towards the cliffside! And with a mighty leap, empowered with all that momentum he's gathered, he attempts to grab onto somebody's hand if they can reach him in time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) diligently scoured the area for any item that could aid her in her mission. Suddenly, the wandering child offered a scarf that caught her attention. Grateful for the unexpected gift, Shishorama tightly wrapped it around her hand. She then proceeded to lean down the treacherous cliff face and extended the scarf with all her might, hoping that Try would grasp onto it so that it would help them advance.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) saw the bloomer leap and swiftly reach out, with her own arm swinging like a fishing hook to firmly grasp his wrist, the type of shit you&#39;d see in Action Movies with sequences exactly like this.

A vicious, potent and strong arch from her arm, similarly to a clothesline, intent on not only grappling the bloomer, but also throwing him to her in one single go with the arch it was doing!

There is only little difficulty to her grasp, as she LAUNCHED the man right up to where they stood!

Nowhere near dirty enough to handle any semblance of defensive measure that staff may permit to him!
Meaning, he's stuck, so close, yet so far away.. Once they touched ground, Shun'Ichi slipped from the Chuunin's grip, adjacent to his target. He had, involuntarily, successfully scaled the mount--however, his test was far from over...</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: The task is laid out for you, how you get it done is how a shinobi completes their mission.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: Okay okay... I'll be your lackey for three days if I fail! How's that sound?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) turned and reached up on the cliff face for any sort of hand hold that would bare his weight even as he slid the fishing rod over his shoulder. He then took a step up, digging the toe of his sandal into the stone face and turning his foot so that he had more surface touching. With a hop he reached another hand-hold and began the systematic climbing of the cliff. He was warmed up now but he was also a little fatigued, so this was just as hard, if not harder, than the first level, and the stakes were much higher. 

Slowly, but surely he worked his way up to the next level. The distance was farther than before but the group was counting on him. Shishorama even cheered for him and let him make the climb first! She trusted him!

The youth winced and hissed as his forearms started to cramp up and his hands went numb with charlie horses but he continued on, stopping only to shake his hands when he felt confident he could hold himself up.

Once Try weakly pulled himself over the top he laid flat on his stomach and took big, gasping breaths for air.

A long moment later the fishing line and scarf were lowered down to the chill boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) doesn't grab her on the way up, no. She had been fired off with much too much force to try and slow her down. He could only watch as the pale girl shoots up and over him, to which he turns and waddles in place, determining where she would fall.

Her lightness worked to his advantage in this department. It was very simple to ease her falling into a simple motion, swinging himself around with the excess inertia and planting her firmly on the rocky, cliffside ground.

<font color = white>&#34;You may go first... Hanako, they said?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Not today. I might need it..

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Negative. Focus on your task right now.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's right!

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'll catch- Yes, Try?!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) watched as the newcomers arrived.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh boy, maybe this means we can breathe for a minute.&#34;</font> he says in a hushed tone, watching the group begin to stratigize their climb. They&#39;d then think about the climb he was about to embark once more, having to face his fear of heights head on.

<font color = white>&#34;O-okay...&#34;</font> he mumbles, turning to face the cliff&#39;s edge once more. He&#39;d look around for those helping the others, aiming to use their strength to aid his efforts.

<font color = white>&#34;P-please don&#39;t drop me.&#34;</font> he gulps, sweating as he continued on up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: It's not mine!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's so clever!

<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: Screw dignity! Cheer for em loud- Oh seems they are takin the.. taller route- let me just,  get back up there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) made it to the top, now, next to her brother. She looked to help Yuuto ascend himself, but noted that he had gone all the way down to the bottom again. With a sigh, the dancer realized just how long this exercise would take and laid down on the rocky mountain top in exhaustion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Cracking his neck he walks up to the mountain once again, digs his hands into the earth and starts to climb. It seemed his efforts to help were largely ignored, ah well it didn't matter. He had his rest and with that he was off. Grabbing rock after rock he'd push up with his legs and scale the mountain just as he had before. Unlike the others he didn't need help.

Slowly but surely he'd make it to the top, that's all that really mattered to him right now.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) asks: eh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) used the fishing line and the scarf to climb. Using his stamina , he focus on the task at hand. He did not need any distractions. To complete the task and forget  all the nonsense behind him. That was the easy enough to do. No hesitation or worry.

Climbing up carefully using the fishing rod and scarf he noticed that this was not bad after all.<font color = white>&#34;This was too much excerise jeez...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#884250>Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) starts to climb, ending up near Try <font color = white>&#34;Ill help ya pull em up!&#34;</font> the boy says excitedly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) asks: Where you...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Make sure you aim straight up, Yuuto! I wouldn't want to see them drop!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) squints . . .</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I would land on my feet even if I fell.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) looks down at the bottom and then to his sister, <font color = white>&#34;Surprised you were helped. Congratulations.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) helped the wandering boy and then the chill young boy up with the fishing line and scarf combination. He then choked up on the fishing rod so that all those up there could pull together on the fishing line.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;re ready to help up whoever&#39;s next! Just don&#39;t try to climb up two at a time or you might snap the line!&#34;</font> He tossed the scarf/fishing line saddle down to Momoko.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: She's a cat!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Meow.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Not a good cat!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: Oh. I have a fishing pole as well!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I see. I'll try harder next time.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) clasped her hands!

<font color = white>&#34;<i>O-kaaay</i>... so we&#39;re jumping it! We&#39;re really doing this. Huh. I, uh, I swam like twice before arriving here, soooo sorry if I&#39;m a little heavy! Water-logged.&#34;</font> 

As she stated as much, she took some generous steps back. <font color = white>&#34;Oh-- and slippery. I apologize in advance if I slip and knee you in the throat, nose, and or forehead in the process! The Officer&#39;s to blame. She took us everywhere-- even through a river-- trying to find this place!&#34;</font> 

One self-deprecating chuckle later and she&#39;s ready to give it a go. From the edge of the river, she fell into a sprint, her sandals clacking and crunching across the sediment, leaving a trail of wet footprints in her path. 

<font color = white>&#34;CatchmeCatchmeCatchme--!&#34;</font> 

She skips a jump, expecting the confident boy to give her the boost she needed to go flying up the elevation-- and to be perfectly honest, she had zero idea what comes after that, since she got a bit distracted! Wait-- there&#39;s a fishing line? 

If so, she&#39;d reach out to grab that and or the cliff-side. Whichever came first!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Two fishing lines then!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: Why are you surprised?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We can really speed this up.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: I'm pretty. Who wouldn't help me?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) looked downward once more, watching the others help each other before wandering over to help Try and the other Lad. He could at least pull with the bit of strength he DID have, even if it wasn&#39;t a lot.

<font color = white>&#34;Let me help, too... I&#39;m not the strongest physically but I&#39;m not useless at pulling.&#34;</font> The Uchiha stated, he got up easy but he was going to pull his weight in this exercise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) follows suit, but... The problem still lies in the fact that the punk never got the chance to swipe the Chuunin&#39;s staff... Oh well, there&#39;s always next time, plus, his sister isn&#39;t around to be shocked or poked with it, so there&#39;s no fun in taking it now.

Well, assuming that Komo won&#39;t allow him to even consider grabbing the staff unless he gets through the &#39;&#39;<i>teamwork</i>&#39;&#39; bit, he inhales sharply, calling out to the two siblings.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey! I&#39;m coming up after yah!&#34;</font> The Boy unveils his scarves, placing rocks between them to form a sling, he spins the scarves about before launching them up, <font color = white>&#34;Grab &#39;em and dig em into the wall!!&#34;</font> He commands, he wasn&#39;t able to gauge their prowess, but judging from the fact that they&#39;re up there and he&#39;s down here, it&#39;s a well aligned gamble.

<font color = white>&#34;Maybe these clothes weren&#39;t a bad choice...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: It was the exact thought on my mind.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (I'll RP after Yuuto)
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: They'll do anything for a pretty face. Poor Uchiha...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Fishing wire...Not what I expected from joining the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) nodded before removing the fishing rod from his back.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll cast down then.&#34;</font> he says before pulling the rod back, throwing it forwards to cast the line down the wall!

<font color = white>&#34;G-grab it!&#34;</font> he&#39;d call down to whoever wanted to ride the fishing pole express.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Someone's arrogant.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Wait... clothing...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well, it's only the first day.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: I this is only day one I ponder what the future holds.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t expect the girl to be wet, but hey, he would help her anyway. The moment she got close, his hands would go under her feet quite easily before launching her upwards towards Shishomaru&#39;s general direction. <font color = white>&#34;Next one!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is conversing but does extend over to clench the scarf between his fingers. He leans over and tugs, pulling back so as to give the punk at least some measure of a foundation to climb on.

<font color = white>&#34;Dig them in with what, stranger? No, you will climb and do so quickly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Isnt going to be boring.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) laughs a bit.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) unwraps his Kimono&#39;s sash, he could use this to help pull people up, too.

<font color = white>&#34;This should work.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Ah- Maybe throw it down to the lass helping people from the bottom!
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: ...Somehow-
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Mmm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) <font color = white>&#34;Hmm.&#34;</font> She lazily caught the scarf flung over her, and held it with not nearly the same conviction as her brother. She rolled over and laid on the scarf, trapping it under her body and between her legs as she scooted behind her brother, acting as an anchor to prevent him from sliding back, as long as he kept himself from sliding forward. It was a little extra weight for him, but...

He could handle it, huh?

<font color = white>&#34;Better hurry.&#34;</font> She called. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m letting go in fifteen seconds.&#34;</font>

Maybe it was her idea of a motivational speech?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) observed the given trajectory of the girl-turned missile for the moment, all the way to her zenith. The wailing was amusing enough it drew a gentle smile across her lips, but she didn't bother to voice her amusement in any way. Rather, she wandered over to take her spot after Hajime, waiting for his own leap to either soar, or flop.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes a deep breath.

Once Hanako manages to rise up to the next level of the cliff, he suddenly steps forth. With practiced movements, he leaps onto Yuuto and he is boosted upwards...!

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s go...!&#34;</font>

An arm extends, to try to reach the cliff-side, or Shishorama&#39;s hand... Despite the fact that he didn&#39;t actually want to accept her help.

Hopefully, he wouldn&#39;t hesitate in reaching for her and fall to a grave injury!

He was also wet, due to the river they swam through.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With an eager expression on her face, Shisho stood at the edge of the cliff, her eyes fixed on Yuuto as he prepared to boost the first person up. Her smile grew wider as she watched Hanako approach, pleading to be caught as she was sent soaring towards the ledge.

Shishorama extends her arms out toward the girl and catches her with effort. Gently placing her to the side, she awaits the next person to be assisted. 

This pattern would continue until every single student made their way up the 'mountain'.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (Shishorama, Hajime rp'd, you can get on that too
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (that RP  shall encompass all incoming students)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (very well, saves time
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Nice to see you here, Hajime!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (We got the double fishing line elevator up on this end)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (and 5 people pulling)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (So you can just poof up here)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: yep
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Why's what?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says:  Nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Thanks, I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: No problem!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hehe...! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) took her turn once Hajime was seen to the top of the plateau. There was very little fanfare as far as she was concerned, her movements almost painfully efficient. One might even have gotten the impression she could scale the wall rather easily without any assistance at all.

And yet, she boosted through Yuuto's assistance, and extended both arms to grasp onto Shishorama, the zenith of her jump only barely missing the height of the ledge. Perfectly calculated to be easy, and swift.

A nod was offered to the pair then, even if she had to lean over the edge a bit to show her gratitude to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) frowned without much to do in this case, it was mainly just watching as he trained with his chakra. it wasn&#39;t the worst thing but he was wondering what to do while he waited for people to pull up.

On the upside when there was someone to pull wwith five people pulling it asn&#39;t too difficult even if he lacked raw strength. As he heard someone whisper he&#39;d nod toward the Wandering Child.

<font color = white>&#34;Still would be easier if I could use chakra to help in this case.&#34;</font> He doubled down on that aspect.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Chakra..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gave a thumbsup to the eccentric girl after she reached the top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: meh
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: . . .Yes, Chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Alright!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) seemed entirely unafraid of zooming right into being tossed several meters into the air. An underdeveloped aversion to danger perhaps. Who knows! 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, wow. I made it! Thanks!&#34;</font>

After getting properly yoinked and placed to the side like luggage (with a fragile label on it), she found herself delivered to the next stage! A system of fishing line pulleys meant to lift them the rest of the way. Uh--

<font color = white>&#34;Are these really strong enough to hold an entire person? Eh. We&#39;ll see!&#34;</font>
 
As the designated crash test dummy, she twisted a double-wound grip around the fishing lines and held tight!

<font color = white>&#34;<i>O-kaaaay</i>, reel me up!&#34;</font> 
She lets them work their give-man-strong magic!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [five-man-strong*]
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Alright guys. In sync.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The ole HEAVE HO!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: This is wonderful!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: H-HEAVE!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: HO!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes steps towards the fishing line and merely observes for a few moments, to see if it truly worked exactly like it was supposed to.

<font color = white>&#34;Huh... This is pretty smart... If the fishing line holds, that is.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Heave!!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) began tugging back on the rod with EVERYTHING he had.

<font color = white>&#34;Lets do this!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) rolled his eyes, abjuring to their remarks. Though, it seemed they in fact weren&#39;t on the strong suit, food for thought he supposed.

There was an advantage to this feat, however; Shun&#39;Ichi was going to do something unorthodox to his experience: he was attempting to mimick Komo&#39;s Body Flicker, albeit with only the process of controlling chakra.

Assuming the lady wouldn&#39;t simply show him again, Shun&#39;Ichi improvised.
He remembers reading a bit on the tiger seal; the de-facto sign to focus chakra within the human body; Shinobi works was more his sister&#39;s talent, however the prospect of chakra control always intruigued him.
Time to display that feat in full flux; with his feet upon the wall and the centre of balance upon his heart--Shun&#39;Ichi placed his index and middle fingers on each hand together, and closed his eyes.
Five seconds pass, he recognizes a spark of energy within his belly, chakra.
Ten seconds now, each second is taken spreading chakra throughout his body, before sending it primarily to his legs.
Five more seconds, he feels a sensation unfamiliar to his physical body; and it provides slack for his heart, the chakra to his feet seem to be stitching him to the mountain.

Shun&#39;Ichi wastes zero time, he rushed up the mountain all the way to a point just short of the peak, he shifts around glncing at the Chuunin once more.
<font color = white>&#34;Still think I&#39;m not up to par yet?!&#34;</font> He goads, though while doing so, he recognizes a fault in his prowess: <i>Reserve.</i>

Immediately the boy scrambles his hands onto the wall, realizing how much strain he&#39;s just placed on his body with that simple feat. He&#39;s in a huff, relying on his own desperation and the Kaguya duo&#39;s willingness to hang on to remain.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Aa--Aaughh, these rocks are a little scrape-ish!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: But I'm fine!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) assumed Chakra was common knowledge and not just horded clan knowledge, taught to their offspring. He was probably  wrong but he had no time to explain before pulling with all his might.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled, trying to work in sync with the other four members of his moving squad. They had done the hard work getting up there manually and now some ingenuity would help with the others.

He groaned as Hanako let them reel her up without her own help. He was expecting the people to climb up as well, but with two lines it should have been possible.</font></font></font>

It simply hadn&#39;t occurred to her that climbing along was an option! Despite enduring bumps and shoving away from the wall where she could to avoid injury!
 
<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t act like a fish! Got it! I&#39;ll be as land-creature as I can be! Uh-- my hands get pruny in water, gah, I hate that!&#34;</font> 

How was she so heavy? Well-- she was drenched from, again, going through the river twice to get here! 

<font color = white>&#34;Wait--&#34;</font>

Ah. Finally someone said it out loud. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m supposed to climb? Ohh...&#34;</font>

She found a nice little set of edges to hook her fingers and sandal-tip onto and started to support some of her own weight along the way. <font color = white>&#34;Ah, hey. It&#39;s a little faster this way. You&#39;re really smart, handstand guy!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) sighed.. damn, that was a lot of energy he put into this. Looking up, he could feel his muscles starting to cry as he would need to get back up again. He had the stamina to help so many people, but even so, he hadn&#39;t thought this through on needing to go back up.

Well, that was his duty... and so, he starts climbing back up, holding back cusses every step of the way, but the time he reached the ledge, he was already extending his hand to Shishomaru. <font color = white>&#34;Need some help...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) scratched her head as the scarfed boy declared his ambitions. She indeed saw some potential in the boy&#39;s chakra control, however potential is just that... Potential.

<font color = white>&#34;Nope.&#34;</font> A single word was said, before she looked over towards the others still working.

She would look around at the class of students, seeing most at the top. She folded her arms on top of her vest as a breath squeaked passed her teeth.

<font color = white>&#34;I see that most of you understood the exercise. A lesson as well as a workout to go along with it. So, lets call it a day right now.

Tomorrow, we&#39;ll work on your mental strengths to go with your physical strength. This is the beginning of Chakra. Now climb down and rest up tomorrow. You all are gonna need it for what comes next.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Whew... T-that was something.&#34;</font> he says softly before looking back down the cliffside. Their eyes became wide as they gulped in terror. He&#39;d go slow, just as he had made his way up.

<font color = white>&#34;S-slow and steady...&#34;</font> he chants to himself in a hused tone, making his way back down the mountainside in order to get some rest.</font></font></font>

She slammed her hand against the paper as her chakra pulsed to the fiber.

Suddenly, several clouds of smoke would appear as several mattresses poofed into existence to soften the fall for the students.

Alas, he was sure that with the matress there, there wouldn&#39;t be any pain. Surely, everything would be fine.

He drops, to his assumed safety, but closes his eyes once he&#39;s in the air!

<font color = white>&#34;So she&#39;s the instructor huh... And... Well, no not really..&#34;</font> He choked himself for a quick moment, if he wasn&#39;t attempting to impress her, then he just... Really wanted to know what was up with her staff is all.

Though all that thinly veild contempltation was snuffed out by the acrobat&#39;s twin, <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s called baby fat, boney, it goes away after you get older..&#34;</font> He&#39;d excuse, climbing up fully onto the mountain top.</font></font></font>

With a loud <font color = white>&#34;Oof!&#34;</font> Shishorama looks around, confused.

<font color = white>&#34;I knew I was tough...but this? It&#39;s unprecedented...what else am I capable of...?&#34;</font> The Senju looks at her hands, amazed by her newfound power.

The ability to summon mattresses....a truly formidable talent...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) hops down off the other lad, <font color = white>&#34; I still didn&#39;t get your name.&#34;</font> He stated brushing himself off as if putting his Kimono back in the proper place, <font color = white>&#34;Yet you carried me the entire way- Ah.

Nice to meet you, Rango&#34;</font> He noted, wrapping his sash back on to complete his appearance. His black eyes glanced towards the mountains, he&#39;d conquer the mountain eventually. Not today, but eventually.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hehe, and I was the first one down.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I guess I&#39;ll try.&#34;</font> he says, leaping down onto the summoned mattress. 

<font color = white>&#34;P-please don&#39;t disappear!&#34;</font> he cried, falling down the cliffside.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: That's it!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Trust in the power of fluff!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) decided to chill out at the second floor for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Be unafraid!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: "Hey Shishorama, how bad was that?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Not bad at all!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) asks: Am I... D-dead?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I don't know.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We haven't exchanged names yet.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm Might, Try!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...Bony?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: If you're talking, you should still be among the living.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: I'm Sarutobi, Yakeru, i-it's nice to meet you Try.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) nods, releasing the scarf officially now that they were right there alongside them. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you should seek to prove something anyhow.&#34;</font> If only to at least make certain they know who they were dealing with.

<font color = white>&#34;You have a name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: ....!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: That's right, I'm alive!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Nice ta meetcha.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Bo-Ney, you're too skinny, and too tall.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: And.. Name's Shun'Ichi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) actually swanton bombs herself off the cliff without restraint. 

Oddly enough, upon colliding with the safety rectangles arranged at the bottom of the cliff, one could&#39;ve sworn her frame deformed like elastic. Only to snap back and toss her squarely onto her face. Eating sediment. 

And there--! She lay. Silent--
<font color = white>&#34;..aaaa--I think I was first.&#34;</font> 

--not silent. Oddly energetic, even, entirely ignoring the impact pains!

<font color = white>&#34;Were you keeping track? I, uh, forgot to.&#34;</font> She glanced over her shoulder to the red head, wondering if he managed to arrive undamaged. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Kedoiiin, Shun'Ichi.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Mmm..
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: . . . All this climbing made me tired...
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Nap time!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Kedoiin, -iin not -iiin.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Sleep well.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: This conludes today's lesson. Be prepared tomorrow.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had closed his eyes...!

He was simply unaware of her elasticity.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh... Kurorama! Who was first? Who won?&#34;</font> He questions, taking steps towards the Senju to stare into her eyes very intently.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Alright!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm gonna go train!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: Oh.. W-wow.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: .. Train? After all that?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: You should let your body rest.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) watching as the magic beds started to appear out of nowhere takes a sigh of relife. It seemed as if the Chunnin was prepaired for just about anything. Worse however it seemed it was encouraging people to jump down the mountain. Quick as it might have been he was not about to temp fate.

Stepping down back upon the earth climbing down would prove to be as much as a challenge as going up. yet same as before he climbed at his own pace.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I wasn't able to climb the entire way up without help.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I need a bath. My shoulder's all.. achy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) casually walked straight into the river.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: That isn't-...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Since I wasn't able to climb all the way up, I'll have to do twenty laps around the school yard!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says:  Yeah it is.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Clean. Ahem.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) looked at her body. She was tall for her age-- but that just made her age harder to guess. There was no beating the lithe allegations, though.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s easiest to dance when you are light and graceful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: What a strange name.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: You've never taken a river bath before?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That's true, the less you are dependant you are with your teammates, the more you can do within a team.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Tell us who won though, Kurorama..! Who landed first?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Very.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: What does Shun'Ichi mean?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: But injuring your body without proper rest will cause you to be more of deadweight for them next time.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I believe you both landed at the same time.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Ack! A tie?!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: What a curious coincidence, isn't it?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It seems like it...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) snapped her fingers.

<font color = white>&#34;Brave one. How interesting. Are you brave?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: How about we do something else?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I understand what you mean.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: STOP ARGUING! The answer is simple!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: -I- made it down first!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Take a nap, after your nap. You'll be stronger than if you trained.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I was thrown after all!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Stop buttin' in, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: This was between me and Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Like hell it's stra--! Oh, um.... I'unno, Mr. Senju gave it to me, not my mama.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Right!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) yells: Trust those words from a former aspiring althete!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I put my butt in however I like!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Umm...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Shishorama, chill.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: No chil! Only fire! The will of fire!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Does that not break an academy rule...?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I do!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Feel the heat of my passion!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Or something...?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...Mister Senju...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) chuckles</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Maybe tomorrow, I'll hold a contest..
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) asks: What was your first name?
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: My big sis' papa.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I still question why you'd bathe in a river.
<br><font color=teal>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Water's expensive.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Do you not have showers at home?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Don't judge.
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) whispers faintly.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) carefully slides  down on the cliff. One by one taking his time.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: You seem rather competitive, Shishorama...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) climbs out. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Huh.
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Was it that cold?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) frowned.

<font color = white>&#34;You are a Senju&#39;s bastard?&#34;</font> She asked, plainly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held out a seal and disappeared from the area.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: But you do quack, if I am to infer that statement correctly.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Hm. Feeding ducks.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) did the opposite of Might, Try. She was not calm. She was never calm. Contrary to his walk, she jogged all around Try until he was ready to pick up the pace. They were just getting started and she was ready for the journey their collective training would take them!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Huh..

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Hm...

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I've never fed a duck before, they're not specimen within my family's aviary.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Your family's...aviary?
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) asks: So uh... What are your names?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Ducks and I have a lot in common,  then!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: You should be careful with breads, and rice. Both are unhealthy for birds.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'm Hajime. Kibo, Hajime.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: My name is Kurorama. And, I mean in the sense that they get ill over time if fed too much.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) frowned slightly, he still wasn&#39;t completely sure what bastard meant, though the way the duo stated it only raised his ire of the word?
<font color = white>&#34;Like hell I am! My mama just had big sis first, then she had me--but Mr. Senju isn&#39;t my papa, see?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How would that even happen?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) walks to the mountain holding a bag of chips. He stared at the group of shinobi with a worried face on him.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Nah, there's a letter in your mail.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Seeds are edible?

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) asks: Oh? What did you guys do in this class?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) seemed interested, now, the aloof expression becoming more focused.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: We saw the fire momument, the hokage's manor and then did some exercise here at the mountain. Get to the top, everyone. Yeah, like he said.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) got down to the bottom of the mountain. Alright, he's already done this five times today, what's a sixth one.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) rubs his abnormally large belly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Hey, Kurorama. You're crazy strong, right?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Have you ever eaten an apple seed by accident? A melon seed perhaps?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Surely, you can help him climb up..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: We need someone to also catch him at the top.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I suppose I'm mildly stronger than my physique would imply. But, nothing outstanding.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) asks: C-catch him?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Ah..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: You heard me.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Haha..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Well, look at the time!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I gotta' go... Uh... Find a nice bench to sleep on!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Hey Hajime, what about beating the Clans. Doesn't that also count on beating us when it comes to teamwork.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: What're you two's names by the by, since mine is "strange".
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Nnnnng...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) got distracted by the portly lad. She&#39;s half looking his way, half answering questions. 

<font color = white>&#34;--err. I don&#39;t think so! I prefer juice anyway.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) looks at the optimistic boy. The fat kid was clearly over three hundred pounds...

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, thanks! Believe it or not, I used to climb trees. My dad always had me do it because when I got to the top of the tree, the tree would suddenly collapse down! Everytime, isn&#39;t that weird?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Y-yes...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That is strange..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) sighed before looking at his flimsy arms.

<font color = white>&#34;I will try.&#34;</font> he says reluctantly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) says: My name is Bloat Max.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: F-fine..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I will try..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: To help him up..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) squinted, although she was smiling that he laughed at such a grim conversation.

<font color = white>&#34;Mr. Senju is a ninja. Ninja kill people.&#34;</font> She informed him. <font color = white>&#34;Kaguya, Kamiya.&#34;</font> It was alliterative; fun to say. A shining, divine valley.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Good luck!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: ...Is that clan-name Bloat, or Max?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Thanks!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: This is to beat the clans...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) says: Max is my real name.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) says: But my friends and family call me Bloat.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) steps forth, and prepares himself to boost the fat. He widens his stance, and joins both hands to create a makeshift platform.

<font color = white>&#34;Give it a go..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) agrees, <font color = white>&#34;All the time they do. It is their job.&#34;</font> It is what they are going to be doing, too. That was never a suden, revealed thing. 
   <font color = white>&#34;Kaguya, Kamiseito.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: We got this, Yuuto.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I'll be sure to get a drink and remain hydrated!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Beating the clans isn't nessesary for this, just make sure you don'y pull a muscle....
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...Eh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) chuckled as he wasn&#39;t phased by the fat kid&#39;s weight. One way or another, he was gonna help them. <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry too much about it, I just hope you can catch yourself if I manage to do this.&#34;</font>

Then he looks at Hajime. <font color = white>&#34;You sure? I was gonna throw him so you could catch him, but that works too.&#34;</font> Unless Hajime changed his mind, he would start climb up. They can help the kid up a bit at a time.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: But I also have a canteen!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: ...Fish pee.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) wipes the chip crumbles from his tanktop as he backs up, getting ready to sprint his way towards the two.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) yells: I hope you guys are ready. I ain't stopping!

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Let's do this.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Mm?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: We've got this.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) dropped back to the ground and assumed the same position as Hajime, the moment the kid came by to use him as a plataform, he would help launch him up.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) hopped off the mountainside once again, taking view of... Komo disguised as a fat man..? Well, he assumed it's Komo, judging from the chakra signature, though how did she get such a well prodded disguise? Was it surgery? Beautifuly done cosmetic? Just plain magistry?!

Nah, probably a form of Ninjutsu, some weird lesson or what not, either way, nothing he's interested in--Shun'Ichi begins to focus his chakra onto his feet again, attaching himself to the mountain slightly better than the previous time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) waddled over for a better view.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) slooowly moved towards the cliffside once more. They needed someone at the top to grab them, right? She crouched lightly, befpre suddenly launching upwards to the next level, landing with nary a sound in the process.

Then, she'd stand herself next to the edge, prepared to assist! Maybe.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: hmm

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) grabbed the boy before he jumped off the cliff, yanking him back by his scarf.

<font color = white>&#34;What the hell did you say?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Did I just hear some guys talk about divinity in their blood? Yikes..!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Clans...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) blinked several times at the sudden departure of the smart attentive one. How did they-- where did they-- oh! Oh. They&#39;re on the cliff. Somehow. When did they get there? 

She wandered over to the cliff, tried to hook her fingers onto an edge-- only to find them slipping right off, unable to find friction nor purchase. Too slippery right now.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: I don't think that's our usual clans...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) nods his head, signalling he was ready for it. 

<font color = white>&#34;For the academy!!!&#34;</font> He barked as he took his first step, his belly jiggled as his belly button popped out from his tank top as his flabby arms would blow against the winds.

He leaped! His right foot going to the overconfident kid and his other to the sable haired youth. As for the optimistic red head, he&#39;ll have the middle part.. Whatever he can grab, it seems.

"Say! Why're you dressed up like a fat person teacher lady! aren't y--

Well, it seems he wouldn't be getting an answer anytime soon, as the fat boy has attempted to flop upon a trio of children.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) was very much the weak link here.

Orphans did not necessarily get to eat too much and he wasn&#39;t the strongest. But he wasn&#39;t about to back down from a challenge...! Alas, when the fat comes running, he finds himself completely unable to lift them. Thus, he finds himself suddenly...

Crushed under the weight of the fat.

Just like every other person in his squad.

Mission failure.

<font color = white>&#34;Gyuhk!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) chased him, her hands legs jabbing out to strike him.

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: I thought his name meant brave.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) winced hard at the telltale crunch sounds coming from beneath the chunky fella&#39;s third fat fold. It took her right out of those climbing attempts. 

<font color = white>&#34;Err--&#34;</font> 
She poked her head around the cliff&#39;s corner.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you okaaay, friend? Need the water now? Are your bones unsnappened? Or do you need a dip?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was more than ready to receive the fat kid and help throw them up. He had done this so many times today. Surely he could do it one more... but still... for some reason the kid seemed more and more menacing with each step.

God, he was tired, maybe this hadn't been a good idea.

Contact was made and he was the first one to buckle under the weight, even Kohaku who he knew hadn't managed to climb up by his own had managed to put more into this than him.

He was crushed.

Mission Failure. <i>We'll get them next time.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Owww...

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Is that how it works? 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) went to LIFT... Though he felt that get UTTERLY DESTROYED as everything began dipping back downwards. The party was wiped in an instant, the blubber has not only triumphed the three under the boy were stuck.

So this was what it was like to get charged by an angry walrus.

Trapped unable to move.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, crap baskets-&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Y-yeah, they get pruny..!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) looks down at her perfectly unpruned hands. Not a single wrinkle was there despite soaking. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I.. think I see the problem.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: It's not happening!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I think... We're talking about different problems..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) grabbed ahold of Kamiya&#39;s leg, in an attempt to pull her over the edge and carry her down alongside him. This time around, he attempted to practice what Kumo had attempted when she stopped Kamiseito and himself from colliding.

<font color = white>&#34;Wanna see how brave I can really be...?&#34;</font> The boy&#39;s face imply curled into a crescent, holding her tightly while chakra rushed to his feet; he attempted to flare it wildly enough for the girl to realize he was attempting something heavily reckless that&#39;ll injure them both.
It was a bluff either way, he definitely didn&#39;t have enough chakra to attempt a Body Flicker, not just yet...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I'm getting crushed under the problem...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) watched it all unfold from her bird's eye view. It was like a car crash happening in slowmotion, and she couldn't look away, forced to see every single detail as the lardness himself collided with the trio. It was beyond awful.

...It almost made her want to chuckle a little. Silly antics, though.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Oh, right. The other problem!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll, uh..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) glanced around for-- 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, right. Sand sticks to things..&#34;</font>

She pops a squat, smacked her hands in the sediment, and then wandered on over. Ready to try and help the chunky lad up, if need be, despite having nothing more than sand, noodle arms and a dream. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) The combined effort of the three wasn&#39;t enough it seems. Bloat Max was now on top of the three, opening his eyes as he noticed he was slightly higher off the ground with the help of the platinum blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah! You guys did it! I&#39;m on top of the mountain! This is so great!&#34;</font> The fat kid was thrilled. He quickly lifted himself off of the three, not noticing that he was barely a few feet off of the ground. He would run off overjoyed.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m definitely going to be a genin! Thanks guys for your help!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I found the grit required to aid you.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You did great, friend!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) is utterly unperturbed, single minded, one might say; she seemed to have little regard for her own body. While he attempted to bring chakra to his feet and threaten some kind of manuever, the Kaguya&#39;s leg is grabbed. There&#39;s a little unearthly grace and bending of joints as she bent in on herself and aimed to deliver a powerful strike to his nose.

<font color = white>&#34;Think you can insult me and get away with it?&#34;</font> She challenged, more of a brute than a graceful acrobat at this rate.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I've never seen someone complete the exercise that way!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) rolls onto his back with a pained expression, before he glances up at Hanako and forces a grin along with a thumbs up.

<font color = white>&#34;T-thank you, friend..! I&#39;m fine.. I&#39;m fine... Thanks for getting him off us..&#34;</font> He coughs a few times, clearly having some difficulty with his breathing still.

He remains on the ground. 

<font color = white>&#34;Y-yeah... You&#39;ve completed the exercise so you can go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You made it up and back to the bottom in like one second flat!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) ventured over to catch the redhead by his ankle. With her persistently gritty fingers, she proceeds to drag him to the nearest water source, and unless he resisted, unceremoniously drag him in. 

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll fix you right up. Uh-- you know how to float, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) laid in the dirt crator, in pain. He knew that would happen, but he wasn&#39;t going to let the others do that alone. All he could do was rub his rib cage.

<font color = white>&#34;I think... my ribs decided to invert. Tell my family it&#39;s too late for me.&#34;</font> Then he plucked a dandelion and played dead.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, yeah- Good job, you&#39;ll pass in no time.&#34;</font> He stated to Max before playing dead once more.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;H-huh, what?&#34;</font> 

He&#39;s dragged into the water, and instantly sinks to the bottom unceremoniously.

Bubbles rise to the surface.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) felt his eyes widen slightly in a sudden notice, seems that Kamiya was less inclined with bluffs over the overbearing insult she&#39;s apparently been dealt. The strike was evaded only slightly, but the sentiment and display of strength was clear.

Instead of continuing to fight against the girl, Shun&#39;Ichi simply released her, pushing her body aside suddenly before launching himself away, letting her freefall the rest of the way--she&#39;ll be fine, probably.
<font color = white>&#34;The hell&#39;s got you all in a huff!? What do you mean I insulted you? What&#39;d I say?!&#34;</font> His voice was loud, but his confusion was genuine, in his eyes, the guyish name remark wasn&#39;t as hard hitting as she was displaying. He felt the academy instructor&#39;s chakra moving away, out of his range and dissapating.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah- Aw damn it! You distracting me allowed her to get away! The hell Kamiya?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

The assault doesn&#39;t end. A single step is followed by a jab toward his gut.

<font color = white>&#34;You know exactly what you said!&#34;</font> She shouted, unforgiving.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) heard the shouts and with another grunt, pushed himself off the wall... stepping back so he could look up. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, everything alright up there?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

The advantage of Kamiseito distracting her allowed him to gain proper ground and distance between the duo.

<font color = white>&#34;No, I don&#39;t yah bonehead! Now hurry up and tell me so I can knock some sense into yah!&#34;</font> He proclaims middair, twirling a bit before landing on soft ground.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) scowled, as he narrowly escaped again.

<font color = white>&#34;This is your fault, Seito.&#34;</font> She mumbled, peering down at her prey with dangerous, red eyes. For just a moment, he received a breather. Slim, rounded shoulders rise adn fall with every breath, each one longer than the last as she stilled her racing, adrenaline-fueled heart.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) raises a hand.

After having been there for a bit, it&#39;s apparent that his fingertips had gotten slightly pruny.

<font color = white>&#34;It kinda&#39; hurts. Mm... Y-yeah, I think I&#39;ve got it.&#34;</font> He declares, deciding that he had to man up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) asks: Why don't you follow him then?
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) whispers faintly.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) snags that raised hand with her notably-non-pruned own. 

<font color = white>&#34;Out ya&#39; go.&#34;</font> In a few strokes of her free arm, she drags him to the shore, where he&#39;d be free to hoist himself out at his leisure. As for her, well, she exits the water and takes a new position beside the Senju. Over the course of about twenty seconds, there were no longer any beads speckling her skin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Today was fun, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: Unfortunate for you, loser.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Yes. I believe my parents would consider much of what happened today 'Quite goofy', as they'd say.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) creaked his neck upsettingly, moving over toward the mountain top again, <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t blame your brother for your mistakes, dumbass..&#34;</font> He affirmed, before climbing the mountain to reach her. She probably hasn&#39;t calmed down, but then again, what did he say that upsetted her so.

He didn&#39;t use chakra this time, getting the feeling he&#39;s going to have to recover slightly in order to flee again.

<font color = white>&#34;And can probably wear you out before you knock me out... Regardless, what did I say?&#34;</font> He questions again, this time showing vulnerability rather than defensiveness, being at her mercy while climbing, subject to any maleficence she may provide.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: My parents wouldn't!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: We learned how to use pulleys and, uh, throw each other. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Skills we will need in the future for sure.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Doubtfully.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) randomly chimes into the conversation and fades back out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) manages to hoist himself up after a few moments, with a few winces here and there. The fat had been extra fat, after all.

He&#39;s immediately twisting his shirt, trying to get extra moisture out of it until he glances at Hanako with a quizzical expression.

<font color = white>&#34;You mind lending me your towel?&#34;</font> He asks.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) tilted her head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Huh? Just air dry. It only takes a minute.&#34;</font> 
She said it as if it were common sense. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watches the dancer and the punk's interaction with some interest for now, at the very least hoping that there wouldn't be any violence among classmates. Unsure if it happened already since it was out of his sight before.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: There's something about being sore from hard exercise that just feels good.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Er. Hard exercise?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Yeah. Scaling the cliffs.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) stomped a loose rock, sending a shower of pebbles down on Shun'ichi, his latest words only inflaming her scorn. She wheeled around on her brother, and weighed the pro's and cons of striking him, too. Her blood was boiling with the characteristic lust of her heritage...

They were lucky she was tired from climbing the rocks.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ah.
<br><font color=teal>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) side-eyes Hanako.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares down at his completely drenched self.

He waits approximately sixty seconds, before he glances up at her.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s not happening. Did you...?&#34;</font> 

A brow quirks.

Bizarre!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) did not speak further on the topic, her lips just pressed together in a thin line.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Oww owwwiwowwowowowow...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) was also questioning what he said, didn&#39;t he just comment on how they were siblings? Then she snatched him up in some weird sort of way, then he turned to Try.

<font color = white>&#34;You should&#39;ve been here to lift the fat kid that made my rib cage concave.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I don't believe she has a towel.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Ah, sorry Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Next time! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) although the rocks weren't large enough to cause massive damage, it roughed his tender child skin quite up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Hopefully, we failed terribly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) &#39;s clothing was in the active process of having moisture osmosised away. Formerly dark spots regained their natural color. Almost as if sponged away.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: That confirms my suspicion, Hanako.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Now, he was interested.

He stood there, drenched, while she was already dry. This was clearly strange. Were his eyes playing tricks on him?

He raises a hand to pat her shoulder a few times, before he attempts to gently pinch her cheek...!

<font color = white>&#34;No way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Oh, right. Thanks for pulling me up, Guy!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) scratched the back of his head. Well, at least that didn't escalate, he then turned to watch the amusing sight that was Hanako trying to figure out Try's name.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No, Hajame. It's 'Try.'
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I've been over this.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) had not entered the water for this very reason. She was wearing even more layers than most, because modesty was key to dignity.

So far it seemed to prove his most difficult challenge yet.

While Hanako explained her own, in grusome detail. He decided to play along.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Hanako. Not Should Hanako. Or Could Hanaka. Possibly Hanako? No. Just Hanako. And not Just-Just Hanako. Only Hanako. But not &#39;Only&#39; Hanako. Hanako. The end.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to swing so hard!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: The hell's going on here?

<font color = white>&#34;Rather rude of you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between the two Senjus and white haired dancer. Was this an altercation brewing in real time. Perhaps something needed to be done to calm the tensions.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys, umm, how about we all just take a moment to cool off? &#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Pfew. Glad that&#39;s sorted out. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) yawned, what a morning it had been already, just idly passing the time. She would just glance over to the girl next to her briefly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. We haven&#39;t spoken before but since we&#39;re standing here. I&#39;m Okiku.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) glad the fighting stopped. She would've just kept taking punches for either student until she passed out. Crisis averted.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sorry my cousin is aloof as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) squinted between them, obviously suspicious of the apology and pleasant greetings. Darting eyes warily regarded the hand gesture. This was the second weirdo to say something and then pretend they didn&#39;t know it&#39;d be a problem. Shoulders roll, dislocating and then -popping- back into place as she maintained her expression, despite the pain that should have caused.

<font color = white>&#34;... fine.&#34;</font> She mumbled, carefully taking her hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (was glad*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;That was rather... Keep doing that and you&#39;re going to have arthritis soon,&#34;</font> she says, pointing meaningfully at the girl&#39;s shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Teach me how to roll my shoulder like that!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks over at the shoulder dislocating like that.

<font color = white>&#34;That looked painful. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: You should get that checked out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) released the other girl&#39;s hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to teach. Just do it.&#34;</font> She replied, ignoring the cautions against arthritis. <font color = white>&#34;Of course it was painful.&#34;</font> She replied, wondering how it could not be-- or why anyone would do it if it wasn&#39;t. Dislocation could be useful for escaping binds, though...

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can ger arthiritis.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: get*
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Can you dislocate anything else?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I see this is today's new hangout.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: This will be my everyday hang out!
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) increases their health by Full - 6 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) yells: Mind if I see!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: At least you'll be easy to find, Shishorama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) held a hand out and bent her index finger nearly all the way back, until it was curling backwards. This was less of a dislocation and more of a hypermobility, though-- but which kid would even care? There's a slight shift in expression, suggesting this was somehow more painful than the shoulder roll.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) widened her eyes at Kamiya&#39;s finger. What the heck is even that?! <font color = white>&#34;Oh my goodness! Your finger is <b>BROKEN</b>!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Nope, the bones are just fine.
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: ...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya watches with a mixture of fascination and curiosity as the white-haired dancer flexes her index finger backward in an extreme display of hypermobility. For a moment, Sakuya thinks she can detect a wince in the dancer&#39;s eyes, a subtle hint that this unusual flexibility comes at a cost.

Intrigued, a thought crosses Sakuya&#39;s mind: this girl might be just as eccentric as she is. Feeling a newfound sense of kinship, she can&#39;t help but feel that a friendship between them could be equally intriguing and enriching.

Taking a step closer, Sakuya smiles and extends her hand in a friendly gesture. <font color = white>&#34;You know, we might have more in common than we thought. Would you like to be friends? I&#39;m Sakuya, by the way. Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would dead pan and turn towards Shishorama.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s a Kaguya- Like the Hokage.&#34;</font> Hoping this would shed some light on their abilities in some compacity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s jaw dropped as he saw Kamiya&#39;s finger.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s...scary to see. Also anyone else started to feel pain in their fingers after seeing that? No, just me? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*she's)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I think he is a she.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [oh man ur lucky u fixed that]
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: So it was an over reaction?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Who cares that she's a Kaguya?! She just broke- twisted her finger!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Do we have a medic-nin nearby?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) let her finger snap back. <font color = white>&#34;Sure, Sakuy--&#34;</font> Kamiya stopped mid sentence, certain she had heard another unlucky soul who wanted to receive a punch. The feeling vanished after a moment. Her finger is held with her other hand, and its discolored, now-- significantly redder than the others, a little swollen. It was hardly a free action as evidenced by this cost.

<font color = white>&#34;It hurts, but it isn&#39;t broken.&#34;</font> She said, to the intense youngster. <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t break my bones.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) gave a long stare- A long confused, judgemental stare before mentally facepalming.

<font color = white>&#34;Her abilities are probably like Lord Hokage, a Kaguya... They manipulate bone.&#34;</font> A smirk came to his face, he found it funny people hadn&#39;t heard stories of the Leader of the Village. Though on a second glance... They could manipulate Bones... but the fleshy parts were still damaged.

<font color = white>&#34;Though, youf pain tolerance must be insane since you damage the flashy bits...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*your Typo 2/2 may as well aim for the moon in typos.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Can Kamiya manipulate my bones too?
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks:  You realized if they're okay then you shouldn't over react, right?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I would assume so.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (question, Kamiya
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (does Kamiya resemble a male?)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) grinned at the Uchiha on the end of the line. She approached the boy, and held  her swollen index finger out. There&#39;s a look of incredible focus. She grunted, and huffed, and puffed, the obvious spice of pain in her inflection as a -hole- began to open at the end of her finger, and a pure, white finger bone began to poke out. It&#39;s clear this is taking an exhaustive amount of effort as her entire body is shaking.

It was revolting; unsettling.

<font color = white>&#34;Pull my finger.&#34;</font> Urged a strained voice.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [yes]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [the other 11 year old kaguya]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (Kami M and Kami F.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I have a question before I pull your finger!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Are you a male or female? I'm not sure what to call you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) couldn&#39;t tell if she was talking to him or to the sable-haired youth next to him. Either way the request was rather weird. Kamiya wanted her finger to be pulled, while it seemed the bone was starting to protrude through the actual finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would blink for a moment, though in his morbid curiousity he&#39;d absolutely do so. He wondered if that bone was in-fact coming out of that gory hole Kamiya&#39;s body seem to make. The Uchiha heard stories of the bones tearing through skin of both user and foe, this was far more clean than anticipated. However there was a strangeness to it when seeing something like this first hand.

The weird part was seeing how white the bone was despite it travelling through fleshm he expected them stained red, really.

<font color = white>&#34;Gnarly.&#34;</font> It was the only wword he could think of while doing this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clenched her jaw as he pulled an entire digit out. The hole closed, and rather than some gelatenous, boneless finger like one woudl expect, Kamiya seemed no worse for wear than before. There wasn&#39;t even a sign that she&#39;d just opened and inch wide hole in her flesh. The pain was real, but there were not lasting effects. 

She took the finger from him and wagged it in his face, the digit bouncing and bending at each knuckle. 

<font color = white>&#34;And now I can use this like a dagger!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) carefully observed the whole thing. The word &#39;gnarly&#39; described it well. But the boy got so invested into the process that he could see every little detail. And this, well, this had undesired results.

Dark haired boy immediately covered his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh I think I&#39;m gonna be sick. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: ---
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: She just -- pulled the -- bone out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the finger, dumbfounded. She thought she&#39;d seen a lot in her twelve years of life, but that was absolutely <i>disgusting</i>. Never wanting to witness that again, she persists in asking Kamiya the question that bothered her so greatly.

<font color = white>&#34;So....are you a male or female...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly wheeled around, slashing the intense youngster with her abnormally sharp finger bone.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you stupid?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Well, no...maybe..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wasn&#39;t sure if he should find this cool, scary, concerning, or morbid. He proceeded to mentally choose all of the above.

<font color = white>&#34;Eeeehww, but awesome. That&#39;s taking &#39;pointer finger&#39; very literally.&#34;</font> Making fun of the situation rather than keeling over sick, though he really had no idea how to react and fell back on humour as a coping mechanism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the they/them, unphased. <font color = white>&#34;I just can&#39;t tell, okay?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: It's really obvious I'm a girl, you weirdo.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: O-Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Right!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Because the voice!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...And the hair...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: R-Right!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: And the pretty face? 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The other Kami is a guy.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: And the unearthjly grace?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Well, you certainly have unearthly grace!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Yeah that last one...oh never mind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) loomed.

<font color = white>&#34;Right?&#34;</font> She whispered, dangerously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Don't all Kaguya have the poise?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) leaned closer to Kamiya with a quirked eyebrow, <font color = white>&#34;Why are we whispering?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Ei!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) makes a small yelp in surprise. She wasn&#39;t easily intimidated, but Kamiya was getting there. <font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you poking me with that!? It came from inside you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) covers his mouth again as she poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Pointer Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sticky Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: It's not my fault that I couldn't tell what you were! You didn't ask to be born like that!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I feel a punch coming.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I have a feeling it'd be more like a puncture wound.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly whipped the finger toward the wall, letting it smash against it into bits and pieces.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re pretty stupid. You&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t beat up special needs children.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: So the bones can break...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: That is a good one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) frowned a bit at the Kaguya&#39;s remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey hey, no need to call names. We&#39;re all friends here. Right? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighs and relaxes as the tension in her body dies down. She was expecting a punch or stab, but it never came. <font color = white>&#34;Phew...that was close. - I wonder when the classes are going to start.&#34;</font> She says, looking off into the distance. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Laro(The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) OOCs: ( hmm so are apps closed? )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Anri(The dead eyed teen-Airide) OOCs: (For?)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Anri(The dead eyed teen-Airide) OOCs: (Good question iunno)

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: It's the best when the villain wins.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) shrugged, <font color = white>&#34;No idea when, but I want to start as soon as possible. If it&#39;s going to use any sort of Chakra I&#39;ll be more than prepared.

I&#39;m just hoping it&#39;ll be very soon, I actually want to do something more than a team work and trust exercise today.&#34;</font> The Traditional Uchiha admitted, pulling out a fan to cool himself once more. He wondered if they would learn anything, or would it be a second exercise? For now it was hard to tell.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I think Anti Heros are better.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I never caught your name bone girl.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Kamiya.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: So do you to be friends or not Kamiya. We can use your bones to scary people.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I said yes before, so I don't mind saying yes again.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: I think I ought to rest for a bit. Let my eyes catch a break, you know?

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kyouhei (The intense white-haired child-Soft boi 666) yells: Obviously!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gaze a bit before he shook his head.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: What's your name, dumby?

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Maybe remove the 'y'.

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kyouhei (The intense white-haired child-Soft boi 666) says: Dumb.
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  If that's all you have to say then you need to work on your insults.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I don't like asking twice.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kyouhei (The intense white-haired child-Soft boi 666) yells: You need to work on your face!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) slowly picked himslef up as he turned his baggy, lifeless gaze on the Kaguya as he straightened himself up, at least to the best of his abilities as all he ahd to his name were baggy clothing and a worn backpouch.

<font color = white>&#34;...Anri.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) stared at the boy.

<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...Okay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gaze away from the Kaguya after their comment. Honestly they were unsure if it was a compliment or an insult at this point.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: But to do that is risking our lives.

Despite being an orphan she seemed weirdly well dressed in expensive clothing.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: And now you're found!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: All because it's my duty in my clan to be Shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Well, nice to meet--- what clan?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: When all I wanna do is sleep.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, well you're in the right place. We're all students-to-be.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Not Hajime.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Sensei went, like.. up the bridge I think?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I shall join the academy to fail.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: What about Hajime?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: I believe she's still in search of a medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hmm? To fail?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: She mentioned something about them having hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Don't worry about it.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: If I fail, then I can sleep as much as I want.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: It's a perfect plan.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: But.. they'll make you take extra classes if you fail!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ...

<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh there she is.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: No...they wouldn't..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Keep runnin' your mouth. I can't wait to hear how you had to explain that someone not from a clan got better academy grades than you to your parents.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: She must've found the medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Isn't that right, Sensei?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Failures have to take make-up classes!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: That is a lie right..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hmph. 
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Lots of talking...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I don't think make up classes would be needed, if you just got it right the first time.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ...but there is make up if you do fail then.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) yells: See, I've never had to do any make up classes!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: ... I've not done any classes.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Just don't fail.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Simple.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Komo sensei.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Did you get my registration?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The first class was just a team work exercise...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Senju, Kumirama. Are they here?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Uh.. Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) falls down onto his knees, laying down on the ground. closing his eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;...This darn academy..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I am Senju.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Uchiha, Batsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: It's okay, Lost! You can find your way to success!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) walked up towards the teacher, slipping a ryo in her sash.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t fail.&#34;</font>

A smile given towards the old Shinobi before dropping her voice lower in a whisper, but still audible to all those around if they listened.

<font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s more where that&#39;s from if I pass with straight A grades.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Hanako, how well do you think you'll do?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: See? The first step's already here. Sign up to join the Academy with Sensei--
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Does success equal sleeping..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I did, I see your name here.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I'm Kaguya...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) looks away. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll do good,&#34;</font> she murmured, lying through her teeth. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I look forward to see you top of the class.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: y-Yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ha ha.. haaa..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: If you don't we'll help you pass.... Somehow.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked at the single ryo as she simply threw it into the river.

<font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t no wishing well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) crossed her arms as she turns to walk past Hajime, briefly sticking her tongue out before halting closer to the others, <font color = white>&#34;I think I&#39;ll have a better time watching you open your grades and hide from me afterwards. Because you did worse.&#34;</font> She had to clarify that last part... Obviously.

<font color = white>&#34;My clan only excels and succeeds after all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) leaned back up, staring at the sky before sighing.

<font color = white>&#34;I will get my family back for this...&#34;</font> He mumbled, raising a single fist in the air.,</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Seems they are doing the bonding.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) raised a single eyebrow, slipping into her pouch as she removes a wad of of over three-hundred ryo. In a hushed voice she spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;So, what&#39;s the price then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked over at the blissful youth.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you Kumirama?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I'm rich.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I have no price.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Kumirama is not over here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) squints, and soon clenches a fist..! Her gesture draws a slightly reddened face from the young man, in frustration.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll see about that.&#34;</font>

He turns away from her, and soon forces a smile as he takes steps towards the two girls in the distance.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. I&#39;m Hajime. Nice to meet you both.&#34;</font>

A single fist extends forth, towards them. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Prove you're rich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looks at her fancy clothes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) with a sigh she&#39;d instead remove the largest fish she had recently caught, handing it over towards the instructor before stepping back next to Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do great at school, teacher.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Hm... Acceptable.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: She does look rich.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Hey, hey. Komo-sensei. How'd you get rich?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) glanced left. 
She glanced right.

It looks like the coast was clear. As long as she ignored the twenty eyeballs within the vicinity. Conditions were perfect. She tip-toed her way over to the guard rail. 

<i>Aaaand</i> slowly started to climb over the obstacle. Her eyes were glued to that discarded single ryo bill. She could buy some candy with that. What a waste! To let it flow away on the current!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Hm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) grabs the raw fish that was given to her by the kombu green haired girl. She savagly bite into the raw fish in its mid section, devouring everything until stuffing the rest of the fish into her mouth, tail end last.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) wasn't sure if she should be frightened or impressed by the display.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) bumped a swollen fist against his.

<font color = white>&#34;Kamiya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Working hard is a good start. Finding more doors to make money.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Being born rich helps too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;I am Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font> She turns to the bright boy and extends her hand. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you as well, Hajime.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's your fist swollen?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) watched Hanako go after the ryo, he didn't care- No one else seemed to care, therefore it was fair game for the Platinum Blonde to go fishing for it. Though he stopped staring to wwatch the Headmistress become a savage and potentially poison herself  to mortify Children.

It seemed to be working.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) does not notice the antics of the headmistress, nor the missed opportunity of nabbing 1 ryo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, watching how the women just devoured a raw fish, He thought for a second, Just staring at her before nodding.

<font color = white>&#34;Do all girls eat like?&#34;</font> He questioned.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) flops over the guard rail, entirely lacking in grace, and sploshed into the river. 

A minute later, she emerged, blowing on the recovered bill, trying and failing to air-dry it. A soggy set of sandal-prints were left in her trail as she made her way back to Position A! Lurking beneath the street light. 

Drenched, but the grin she wore says she's elated by her mission accomplished. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I pulled my finger out.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Entirely.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You shouldn't do that.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't think it is as bad as it seems.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Good work, Hanako. Stealth is a virtue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: w-- You saw?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) steps away on that note, shuddering, even.

Was he speaking to some sort of savage?

<font color = white>&#34;G-good luck in the academy..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I mean, uh..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. saw what? I did nothing.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't like his face.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ?!?!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: I see everything, I've been practicing.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I would pass on eating contests.. They are a waste of food.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's kinda rude.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) pulled out a fish of her own as she stared towards it. She&#39;d take a few seconds of simply gazing at the fish before starting to copy the teacher as she devoured it all bar the bone which would be deposited into a nearby trashcan.

However astute eyes would notice that whilst the fish she had taken out was raw, every bite would be charred and mostly cooked as they entired her mouth. The Hyuugas would clearly notice her pumping katon attuned chakra into the fish to flashcook it.

<font color = white>&#34;Now I&#39;m a real woman, like sensei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: I heard that, y'know?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh yeah? Well--
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I was talking to my friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Loudly.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That is the true test of womanhood...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm...a waste. I guess that makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's okay, I don't like you either. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yawns while trotting down the road.
He glances over to Kamiya, standing next to his sister.

<font color = white>&#34;You.&#34;</font> He scowls ot the both of them, though mostly to Kamiya for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: You looked at her weirdly. I didn't appriecate that.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Usually people descale and debone the Sashimi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) giggled at Sakuya&#39;s words. She approached Hajime and drew her nails down her cheeks, drawing blood--

And then, Shun&#39;ichi appeared.

<font color = white>&#34;What?&#34;</font> She spat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: A true women it's it whole I've been told.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...............
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I must continue my search for Kumirama.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: She went north I believe but I might be blind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) paused. 

Her limited attention span was drawn to the events taking place nearby. Aversion, repulsion, and every sickened emotion in between creased and wrinkled her face, watching someone eat a fish of all things in such a animalistic manner!

<font color = white>&#34;Gross. Fish are gross! Don&#39;t you know where that thing&#39;s been, Maya?!&#34;</font>
She waved her arms frantically in protest!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares.

His eyes widen upon seeing the illogical behavior of Kamiya, who draws blood with her own nails. 

<font color = white>&#34;Umm... Kamiya, does that not hurt...?&#34;</font> He asks, though the sheer display has him weirded out, incredibly so.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held out a single seal, disappearing.

<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: What a interesting person.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;.....&#34;</font> Nothing was said, he simply glares, circling her aimlessly before replacing her spot at Sakuya&#39;s side.

<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you hanging around that thing, sis?&#34;</font> He initiates.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) looks to Maya as a fish was withdrawn from somewhere and stared at, <font color = white>&#34;Wait, that&#39;s not good for you--&#34;</font> The Hyuuga grimaced as the Gorumba&#39;s mouth opened to chow down - only to relax all of a sudden and exhale. All tension flows away, like that ryo bill in the river would have if not &#39;saved&#39; by Hanako.

She was puffing flames to cook it at the very last second... Scary, but... Not as poisonous as it could have been. The fish probably had scales and everything though, gross.

<font color = white>&#34;...I think fish isn&#39;t for me anymore.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) removed a napkin from her pouch as she began to delicately dab at her lips in order to clean them of any fishy debris before turning her attention towards Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;This river, I caught it myself...&#34;</font>

A simple answer to a straight forward questio as her head cocked to the side in a curious manner.

<font color = white>&#34;And it&#39;s a fresh as it comes, orphans can&#39;t be picky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: What thing are you talking about?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) swiped her eyes over at Hajime. The cuts aren&#39;t particularly deep, but she bled softly from the rake all the same. It doesn&#39;t take long for it to roll down to her jawline, and then drip to the cobblestone beneath.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course it hurts.&#34;</font> She replied, before moving to face the ugly, green-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m going to hurt you really badly.&#34;</font> She promised to Shun&#39;ichi.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Wait! I know what to do. We should check if she's choking or just poisoned.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) a single weak hand raised towards her chest as she began to pound it with a closed fist whilst being dragged away by Hanako.

It was indeed a pin bone that she had swallowed, a sharp end had lodged itself within the base of her esophagus and needed to be dislodged.

However she was too weak to dislodge it herself, causing each weak dull thump to just cause her to choke loudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) held mochi to her mouth as the girl barragged her with words... She didn't exactly understand sarcasm... She just stared at her...</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I knew it! She&#39;s choking, I&#39;ll get it out,&#34;</font> she claimed before reaching to still Maya from Hanako in order to pull her upright, <font color = white>&#34;Let me.&#34;</font> She straightens a hand out into a palm...

This needed to be a precise move to work, or else, it simply would not work.

He had seen it happen before..! 

<font color = white>&#34;No pain, no gain..&#34;</font>

After garnering the necessary momentum, the young orphan jumps onto Maya&#39;s stomach to deliver a drop kick with the force of gravity behind it, performing the most violent heimlich maneuver possible..!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got you..!&#34;</font>

The fact that the Hyuuga was trying to save her had ignited his competitive spirit, and he wished to do so, instead. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) Alas! A saviour who knew what was wrong, her attempted murder by drowning was adverted for now as the strike PERFECTLY dislodged the bone as it ejected from her mouth with speed, flying through the air in a perfect arc before landing innocently on the ground in front of them.

A gasp of air entered her lungs as she began to violently cough for a few seconds.

<font color = white>&#34;T-Thanks... damn fish bone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Are you sure? You ate pavement really hard!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Like.. your head made a 'thonk' noise.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I thought that only happened in manga! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) has a lump on his head, from it striking the pavement.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, but if you put me in the water, I&#39;ll get wet. My money will get wet. Then, I won&#39;t be able to buy you the stuff I told you I would.&#34;</font> He protests, before he raises both hands up to plead for mercy.

His eyes were spinning, though. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) released him, if only because he insisted he was fine. 

<font color = white>&#34;Untrue! Shopkeeps don&#39;t mind when the ryo&#39;s a little soggy! They just.. narrow their eyes and stare at you a lot. It&#39;s probably because the sogginess makes the numbers harder to read?&#34;</font> She shrugs! A hand came down, offering to yank him to his feet. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would watch the Senju and Kaguya both strike the bastard child of a Senju, he was doomed. Though, the one being struck was being a jerk. He honestly didn&#39;t care if it didn&#39;t escalate further than it had, and all the while another girl was saved from a fish bone.

<font color = white>&#34;And the day was saved, thanks to the Hyuuga.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) An overbearingly smug grin hooked upon the corners of the Hyuuga&#39;s lips and tugged wider as she witnessed her perfect strike dislodge the fish bone straight from the source. It surprised her a little, but she would never admit that. As far as anyone else knew, this was planned and she was the most skilled academy student.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahaha! You&#39;re welcome. Nothing comes close to my clan&#39;s techniques after all,&#34;</font> she proclaimed, side-eyeing Hajime after he had failed to compete and was now being dragged off to heal underwater. Or attempted to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) The backhand, caught him off-guard! The Senju sibling was definitely quicker than the Kedoiin, which forces him to bite on his tongue fiercely. <font color = white>&#34;Owhhhhh! Sahu--&#34;</font> Followed by Kamiya&#39;s own violent outburst, though, he wouldn&#39;t give the girl the satisfaction of hitting him.

Blocking the girl&#39;s attack, he continues to whine with a damaged tongue, <font color = white>&#34;Buh, Kahiha sarhed i&#39; &#39;he ot&#39;er deh!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) accepts the yank!

He rises to his feet with her aid, a tad wobbly. He threatens to wobble in all four cardinal directions and fall again, due to the previous impact.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow. Can you guys stop spinning, please?..&#34;</font> He requests, before side-eyeing the spinning Hanako as well, with a faint flash of spite.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Hinoue.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Hm?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) relentlessly attacked, delivering another kick. He seemed to think this was some sort of game--

It was not, as the blood poured from her own rakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) noticed Hajime&#39;s unsteadiness.

A swirl that carried him east, north, west, south! Hm! Clearly the remedy for such things was to spin him in the opposite direction, as to unwind the factors that made him dizzy in the first place! So! She grasped him by the shoulders and spun him clockwise, akin to a kid being prepared for their turn at a pinata. 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s okay! I&#39;ll just.. unspin you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I'm a medical professional. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) was not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) arched a brow inquisitively as the veiny protrusions spreading from those fainty lavender orbs would gradually soften and lose their prominence - no longer visible against skin. She wondered what could have prompted this request, but she doubts it was anything bad after witnessing her greatness just now.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... Alright, sure,&#34;</font> she obliged, <font color = white>&#34;Lead the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Oh no.

<font color = white>&#34;W-wait..! Unspin..? Wah..!&#34;</font>

The unspinning has the opposite effect and he finds himself teetering even more, until he threatens to collapse right onto Hanako..! A hand rises to cover his mouth, as well.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) recognized that shade of green. Why-- that&#39;s the same shade of green she took on mere moments ago, watching Maya chomp on raw fish! She frantically circled him, intent on escaping his potential spew range!

<font color = white>&#34;Ack, abort, abandon mission! It didn&#39;t work! It didn&#39;t work!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) pulled a chair out of her pocket and took a seat on the bridge to watch the commotions until something else happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Seeing that the situation has escalated beyond any hope of peaceful resolution, Sakuya joins Kamiya in taking decisive action against Shun&#39;Ichi. She launches into a coordinated assault, seamlessly blending their movements into a relentless series of kicks and stomps. What unfolds could be likened to what is widely known as <font color = white>&#34;being jumped,&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) collapses to the ground, and though he keeps his mouth covered for a few moments, he soon breathes a sigh of relief.

He had avoided death itself. Or the death of his self-image for the foreseeable future.

Only after a few moments, does he tilt his head backwards while lying on the ground to finally realize that the fight was still ongoing.

<font color = white>&#34;W-woah... They&#39;re jumping that kid... &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hm??
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Nah, they're just helping him out. Probably. He's clearly choking.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) passes off the fish.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: No, no... They're stomping him out...
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Hm? Just a normal day at the orphanage... kids have to be strong enough to protect themselves.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Like, when you talk back against the big kid in the orphanage..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: H-hey..! Cease this stompening!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) received a bunch of fish. She released them back to their natural habitat. 

They lifelessly float away on the current, dumped back into the river. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Goodbye, fish. Go back to peeing in the ocean, as Kami intended.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Class time...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: In a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I wonder what will be thrown at us today..
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) felt a twinge of audacious spite creep up on his shoulders. To which he&#39;s forced to answer with his own deftness.
First order of business, getting away from Kamiya--she&#39;s the stronger one of the two, if his memory serves him correctly, so getting away from her would prove advantageous, forcing him to only deal with Sakuya.

He&#39;s never won a fight against her, though today&#39;s the day he might be given the chance to try.
Kamiya is evaded this time, with Sakuya being blocked. He uses Sakuya&#39;s weight to bounce away from the dynamic duo and more toward the riverbanks. The bell sounds, however, he knows the kids won&#39;t relent; and he doesn&#39;t plan on doing so either.
<font color = white>&#34;Coh&#39; aht meh... Bich&#39;s.&#34;</font> He states, as long as Kamiya&#39;s interrupted by Sakuya, he&#39;s safe, somewhat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Hey, hey! Two on one isn't fair..!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) delivers the line that had gotten him stomped out at the orphanage many times.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) was on his ass. Was she lying about him being faster? It seemed like it...

Just as a punch is about to be thrown to his cranium, though, the dancer twisted her body away and cartwheeled to a standing position.

<font color = white>&#34;I head the academy bell. You&#39;re lucky.&#34;</font> she said, to the fat-tongued boy. <font color = white>&#34;You will apologize to me after class or you&#39;re going to keep getting this.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t a very hard demand to meet, luckily for him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya stopped her assualt. It was time for class.

<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be inconviencing us like this Shun.&#34;</font> She shrugs as she readies herself to leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) breathes a sigh of relief once he sees that yet another stomping had been averted..! No doubt thanks to his efforts, as he had told them that stomping was wrong, and to cease. Clearly, this was a victory for him.

He rises to his feet after a few moments, still a bit wobbly, but he smiles regardless.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;all wanna&#39; head to that lesson?&#34;</font> He asks, before his gaze focuses upon the one referred to as Shun.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, man! You alright?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, shoot. I'm gonna be late! 
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: You're gonna be early.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: It's okay to be a little early, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. wait. I still haven't turned in my application. I can't be late.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Turn it in..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm safe.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No! I like the immunity! 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: You wanna' be immune to graduation, too?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: If I turn it in, they'll start keeping my lateness on record--
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. I'll turn it in the day before I graduate.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's the perfect crime.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Huh. Smart...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll go on ahead! Uh-- where's the class at? 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: West.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) blew a raspberry at Kamiya and Sakuya, moving to the snow to shove some in his mouth, hopefully it'll stop swelling soon. Though, the Kaguya's sudden advancement did muddle him slightly... Just how much quicker has she gotten in the past few days...? And how quickly could she advance?

Well, there's a limit to how much power one could produce without actively dipping their toes into the Shinobi world... Perhaps it was simply a gap in skill as opposed to some innate talent or development. Yeah... That's probably it.
He ignores Hajime, watching the duo who nearly beat his ass strut off, enviously figuring out how to get some revenge.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: This guy looks fine.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: We should all go... I'll see you there.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Which way is west--
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Guess we can head over.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll follow him! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) strutted off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm marrying the vlllage!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'd never seen one. Wow
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: For a large bride.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: The entire village?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Is there anyone that large?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: The ground and all!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Like, everyone?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Umm...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: No, sillly!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: THE village@

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Says who?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Me.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Says me.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hah ha.. there's no one that large.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Wrong!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, wait..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: If you married the village, your spouse would be sleeping with everyone here.-
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: He's getting married already!?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: wow..!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) despairs at the thought!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) laughed out loud, obnoxiously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Konoha, you cheater!
<br><font color=teal>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) whispers: Yeah yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Marriage is a weird concept.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares at Kamiya as she obnoxiously laughs, before he laughs faintly himself. He only now notices her presence, and shudders.

Why did he have to stand next to her?

He shuffles in his spot. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: What's wrong with getting some rest?
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) whispers: Good. You may introduce me, should you like, I'll just watch for now.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You're a weird concept!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) was confused.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) turned her neck unnaturally toward Hajime; she&#39;s smirking toothily at him, but her eyes are predatory.

<font color = white>&#34;Hehehe...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) yells: Did I make it in time?!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Indeed you did.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: You're late.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You made it!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Tch..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: There is a time or two in here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) A single glance at her is enough to make him go completely stiff, as he straightens his posture and stares straight ahead without an ounce of relaxation possible in his physique.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I'm not going to eat you...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: One moment. I will have to hunt for someone.
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: Just be nice to me, and we can be good friends.
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Haha...I didn't think so... I mean...

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Kamiya eats people that aren't nice to her?!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) yells: Oh. Good job!
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I only attacked that idiot with green hair because he called me a brat. Then he called me a thing-- twice.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) overheard something scary. So, like any reasonable citizen, she looked away and whistled poorly. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I'm not that strange...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held up a single seal, before disappearing with parting words.

<font color = white>&#34;Class, this is Senju, Akitaru. One of the Jonin. He&#39;ll be babysitting you for abit, while I am away.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Umm...Sure..! We can get a few friends to play tag, yes...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) sighed softly and took center stage. He was silent, waiting for the class to settle, stareing out at each student. He memorized faces and hair styles, but more then that, ke felt for who they were.</font></font></font>
