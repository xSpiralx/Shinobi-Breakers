He would return the thumbs up and then look around for the boy&#39;s clothes which may have ended up being washed away in the water.

<font color = white>&#34;So you need clothes because you are cold? I see.. so functionality over design..?&#34;</font> he mumbles as he takes some notes.
It was clear that if someone wished to convey their words, then they would either need to shout or talk fro REALLY close.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) taps his notebook as he waits for more feedback on the idea of purchasing fashion clothings. <font color = white>&#34;Anyone else wants to share their opinion?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) put away the notebook as he realized that none of the kids had an opinion to share.. either because they were shy, or because they didn&#39;t know the true value of being dripped the fuck out.
<font color = white>&#34;Seems like it might be too early for questions.. I&#39;ll come back later. Be a darling Sha-chan, and ask your young friends if they would be interested in the prospect of purchasing designer clothes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Then a minute passed.

His eyes closed. Breathing stopped. Then he opened his eyes and looked to the muscular male.

<font color = white>&#34;..HNNMMM!!!!&#34;</font>
He had just in that moment. Flexed his brain and continued to flex. Showing him the prowess of mental thought over verbal command.

A groan eased into her throat again, and it was pushed back into place.
