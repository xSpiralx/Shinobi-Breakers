Another successful hustle! Another successful bamboozle!

He extends a hand towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game, Hanako. Pay up. You get to keep your one special ryo, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) produced ten crispy (slightly moistened) bills from her stack. 
<font color = white>&#34;Yes..&#34;</font> 

A brush of thumb fans them out like playing cards. She takes her time inspecting their faces, their authentication codes as per mint standard, admiring their old-man faces. Reflected in their pale green eyes, she could see all the precious memories that brought them together; playing a complicated red-light green-light, and..

    ...and... 

.. actually, that&#39;s about it! Yep. Participation reward, and then the dive into her pocket because she had to go hear a speech. Good times. The best of times. She extended the bills to their new owner, entirely lacking in sadness, despite this departure. 

How could she feel disappointment, seeing the other kid look so giddy over receiving these funds?! Haa. That&#39;s probably the exact same face she wore when she first acquired them. Right?

<font color = white>&#34;.. take good care of these. Remember how good it feels.. to receive ten ryo. Take it from me. I&#39;ve learned.. it&#39;s a feeling that does not last forever.&#34;</font>

Winds thread through her blond locks as she turned her gaze to the sky, akin to a meditative Bodhisattva arriving at an epiphany. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I see. This decision has caused a severely traumatic scene to unfold.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Halt this.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Gamble with pretend money.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Boy, if you accept those funds, I will punish you thusly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) nods her head, content with the extended threat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Ehh? Aren't all funds made up?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: They're just paper someone drew faces and numbers on!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Besides. He's my friend, so I don't mind if he has them! We'll call it payment for playing a game with me.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Pretend money has no value in the real world.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: That is a bad mindset, girl.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) &#39;s eyes remain transfixed upon Hanako&#39;s demeanor and her apparent relationship with these bills, that had been acquired after such hard toil, a fierce game of red-light, green-light that was overly complicated but extremely fun. Even so, upon seeing the way that she stares at the money, he simply cannot feel as giddy and elated as he wanted to.

It seems like his plan to get her to go double or nothing, was quickly fading from his mind.

Could he summon forth the guts to take everything from her? To trick her into losing it all? To strip every single penny from her being?

Never had he hustled someone, and been called a friend for it!

He smiles awkwardly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey... Umm... Friend.. What were you going to buy with this money?&#34;</font> He questions, as he scratches his cheek and suddenly finds the water behind them extremely interesting. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) sagely nods as the results unfold before her. Watching as Hanako speeds through the seven stages of grief was a nostalgic one- she, too, learned the horrors of gambling the hard way. 

<font color = white>&#34;Mm?&#34;</font> She waved off the noble&#39;s concerns. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s only the ten ryo I gave them earlier. Besides- people don&#39;t realize the weight money has until its gone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Best to teach 'em early, mm'hm.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) offers a light huff, before looking over the woman beside her. It's hard to tell if she's checking her out or wondering what she'd look like on an operating table. Still, she looks at the children, watching them. Judging the boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) wouldn't think much of the noble's engaged staring; the meaning behind their gaze was unclear, but she wasn't looking for it. With a hum, she, too, directs her attention back on the pair as they resolve(?) their game.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) tilted her head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Uhhh... ten ryo is a lot. A pack of cookies and maybe a carton of milk? Some candy with the leftovers? It&#39;s fine! I probably don&#39;t need it! Eat enough sweets and-- did you know? Your teeth will fall right out when you least expect it.&#34;</font> 

She flashed the red-head a grin! 
There was a stalk lack of missing teeth there. 
In fact, they were in mint condition. 

<font color = white>&#34;.. they&#39;re a pain to grow back. A super major headache. Don&#39;t worry! I&#39;m better off without it. Already over it. More importantly-- weren&#39;t we supposed to be at the mansion? Or.. was that postponed?&#34;</font> 

She leeeeaned sideways, looking past him, trying to make out any crowds in the distance. Sadly, her visual range was severely limited. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ten ryo can nearly afford one of the cheaper books in my usual bookstore.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) a-hems!
<font color = white>&#34;Actually, they switched locations. Follow the water and you&#39;ll find them.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) grimaces faintly once he realizes that someone he had just hustled was grinning in such a pure manner, at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think your teeth would fall out from a few cookies.... Umm... I&#39;ll buy you some.&#34;</font> He offers, before turning towards the location that was being shown. 

<font color = white>&#34;We can have cookies and milk, to celebrate our new friendship. How&#39;s that sound?... Some other day, though.&#34;</font>

A smile forms, before he turns to walk towards the academy headmaster&#39;s location.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) takes a sip from her flask, after uncorking the top. She takes a sip of whatever is inside of it, before yawning loudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) leans forward slightly, hands resting atop her knees. Her back arches, earning a few, quiet pops from her joints..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) raises an eyebrow at the joint popping, and after another sip, a reaction, an offer, is posed.
<font color = white>&#34;I can aid you with that, if needed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
