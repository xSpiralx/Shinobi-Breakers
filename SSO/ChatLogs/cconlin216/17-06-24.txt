<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would slowly turn around as he heard an extra set of footsteps that wasn&#39;t his. The man was covered in all black, looked like he had multiple layers on. When he turned, his entire face was covered by a Red and White Mask. The figure would tilt his head towards the side, before pulling out a book, and what seemed to look like a very fancy pen. Probably the fanciest pen they&#39;ve ever laid eyes on.

The figure would begin to write:

<font color = white>&#34;Is there something you need?&#34;</font> Turning the question, towards them.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) would stare up at the man before them. Their cold black eyes observing the black garmants and odd mask that covered his face. It would be noted by the individual that this child was quite small and innocent looking. They would probably also struggle to determine whether it was a male or female.

<font color = white>&#34;I was just curious about your mask.&#34;</font>, they said with child-like glee, their small child like hand extruding from their kimono sleeve which was clearly a bit too long. 

<font color = white>&#34;Where did you get it? Are you like an assassin or something?&#34;</font>, they inquired</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would straighten his head, rather than have it tilt to the side. Through the mask, he would study the rather small child...they looked frail...they looked cold. The individual would remain silent, never speaking even one word. Even while breathing, it didn&#39;t seem like he was exhaling or inhaling through his mouth. However, he would take back to his book and pen, writing things down once again.

<font color = white>&#34;I recieved this mask many many years ago. It was given to me at first due to the kill orders I was beginning to recieve. Let&#39;s just say...I&#39;ve put too many people in the ground, to where I no longer can show my face for my safety, or for this villages.&#34;</font> After which, the masked man would take for a moment, to look at the sky. Even under the mask, would be another black face-mask, wrapped around his neck, and lower face.

Afterwards, he would take attention back towards the cold child. Writing once more.

<font color = white>&#34;And...what of your jacket? Does it not keep you warm? You look like you&#39;re skin is going to freeze ten times over..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) smiles at the masked individual. Oddly, they would seemingly be unmoved by the mention of the figure before them, in fact being some sort of assassin. A gentle breeze would blow, causing their hair to lightly flutter in the wind.

<font color = white>&#34;This scarf isn&#39;t really meant for keeping me warm...It&#39;s a momento..&#34;</font>, they said, the child-like innocent slightly cracking to reveal a sort of pain beneath. They would exhale slowly, their eyes looking in the direction of the masked figure, but his stare almost seeming as if he was looking through them.

<font color = white>&#34;It must be hard...Not being able to show your face.&#34;</font>, they said, solemnly.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would continue to look at the cold child through his eye slits, he would begin to look up and down slowly at them. Studying their body behavior, before listening to them for a moment. The masked figure would then take to his book and pen once more, before continuing to write.

<font color = white>&#34;At first, it was very hard, but I have grown accustom to this mask. It&#39;s like your scarf, that&#39;s your momento, whereas this is mine. I&#39;ve been wearing this for about Fifteen Years now, and I have never once thought of wanting to show my face.&#34;</font>

He would write, before taking a step closer, in fact, he would bend down to meet with the child&#39;s own height, getting onto one knee. But...even though he was this close, the child still wouldn&#39;t be able to see through the eye slits.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me....what is the momento for? You lose a loved one or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Afro(The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) OOCs: (im I seeing this icly or this is a locked event?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) tilted their head down as the older individual lowered themselves to their height. The slits of the eye mask now level with their own eyes. He would continue to observe the mask, taking mental notes of its intricasies and design.

<font color = white>&#34;Hasn&#39;t everyone lost someone..&#34;</font>, they would say solemnly. His small child-like hand would reach out attempting to touch the mask, if allowed he would simply rest his hand where the cheek would be and speak.

<font color = white>&#34;It has to be awfully lonely. Knowing that when you&#39;re time comes, noone will remember your face. That&#39;s so sad.&#34;</font>, they said, continuing to stare into the masked individuals eye slits.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would tilt his head towards the reaching hand, before quickly raising his own hand to meet it. He would squeeze as hard as he could at first, before softly releasing the pressure, and pushing the arm down. Truly, the masked figure didn&#39;t understand what this sentimental motion was. In fact...he&#39;d tilt his head towards the child, before slowly raising to his feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Most may have lost people, but I am one whose not lost a single soul that they&#39;ve cared for. I put my job before my emotions. To have such emotions...to cry over the dead, is beneath me.&#34;</font> He would show the page once more, before beginning to write even more

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need anyone to remember my face, nor do I crave to show it to anyone here.&#34;</font> He would show towards the child, before looking over at the other kid that had spoken up. Moving to the side, and straightening his head once again, he would remain looking through the eye-slits of his mask. Writing down on a seperate piece of paper.

<font color = white>&#34;This child was asking me qiuestions about my life. Nothing more, nothing less. Is there something you need?&#34;</font> He would flash the parchment towards the red-headed child.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) draws in closer and observes the masked figure unsure as to what was developing. <font color = white>&#34;Eh... is everyone okay over here? He asked towards his fellow village-man.&#34;</font> 

Afro arrived too late to overhear the conversation but would make note of the figure&#39;s attire.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Hmm... are you a member of the village military?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) feels his hand get grabbed as he attempted to touch the man&#39;s mask. In the next instant, he would feel his hand being squeezed almost to the point of being crushed by the older man though just as quickly as the pressure was applied, it would softly released.

<font color = white>&#34;Ow!&#34;</font>, he yelled out, holding his hand with his other non-squeezed hand, examining it, as a purple and bluish bruise appeared. It did not take much, as he was clearly quite frail.

<font color = white>&#34;Well...That wasn&#39;t very nice.&#34;</font>, he said, as he continued rubbing his bruised hand. <font color = white>&#34;You must not have any friends if that is how you act. No need to be so harsh mask guy.&#34;</font>, they said, their cold exterior quickly overtaking the moment of surprise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) took note of the passive force displayed and waited for a response, though he was young, the academy student was well aware all intel whether big or small was vital when formulating a course of action. However, he thought it was pretty childish and naive to approach such a towering figure un-armed, especially in the blood-thirsty ninja world. 

Thought: <b>Maybe this is the perfect time to ask</b>

<font color = white>&#34;If you are indeed a shinobi of the village, would you be willing to take me on as a student? I would vow never to speak of your existance nor pesture you for your mentorship.&#34;</font> 

Afro intent was truly to learn the way of the shinobi. 

<font color = white>&#34;As a token of our arrangement would you willing to gift me a single kunai with your engraving?&#34;</font>

Should the figure accept, Afro&#39;s journey as a shinobi would begin. Creating a storyline far different from those in the limelight. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would look toward the afro haired child, before nodding at his question. The masked individual had multiple layers on which made it very difficult to see any skin on his body. The only noticeable thing would be his white spikey hair. Other than that...there was no hint as to what he looked like. He would once again take to his book and his pen.

<font color = white>&#34;I will not apologize for the bruise that has formed on your arm. You would be the same, if you have lived the life I have been through. Spies within your own village from another, trying to find the person they are looking for, just so they can finally be rid of Amegakure&#39;s Executioner.&#34;</font>

His visage would look towards the afro kid, before shaking his head no. Once again, taking to another page of the book and writing down again.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not take students, personally. But...that does not mean I will not be making sure you all are in tip-top shape to take the lives of our enemies. Perhaps, if one of you proves yourself within the coming year or two, I will change my mind, Just know...I will be watching and paying attention to your growth. A of current, it is too early to decide if any of you are worth my time to personally oversee your training and abilities.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) holds up his small blue and purple hand which is obviously bruised from nearly being crushed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With that guidance, the girl bursts onto the scene of gathered individuals. She steps forward, her height in stark contrast to the masked individual. The contents of their conversation don&#39;t even register in her mind. Throughout that group, only one youth gains the attention and ire of the blonde&#39;s sunset-colored iris.

     <font color = white>&#34;<b>Runt!</b> We&#39;ve still got a score to settle!&#34;</font>

One hand moves to her own hip. The other extends outward, a dedicated point thrust right towards the cold one&#39;s face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) Took note of the figures words and recorded his title as <b>Amekagure Executioner</b>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid-sentence when he hears a familiar screech. Quickly hiding his hand back in his kimono sleeve. He would look over to the blonde haired hag from the other day.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh no.&#34;</font>, he thought, slowly moving backwards away from the girl, his cold eyes intently locked onto her.

<font color = white>&#34;You stay away from me, ha-....Lady..&#34;</font>, he said coldly. Best not to antagonize one with such monstrous strength.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Should be fine, Naji'.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;No can do!&#34;</font>

Even the mentions and quick brandish of his injured hand don&#39;t phase her or halt her approach. Once more, that invisible spark of tension radiates from her eyes as the two lock their gazes. Her target had already been set.

     <font color = white>&#34;Executive orders, short-stuff. Hand over your shoes!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: What she said. Would rather strong-arm them from you than one of my cousins.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would hear some rather newer voices, one&#39;s he hasn&#39;t even seen or met yet. It had seemed the village was bursting with energy, but...he didnt care for the commotion in which was going on. He didn&#39;t turn his visage towards anyone, in fact, he was focused on one thing and one thing only. The destroyed village that was currently needing to be Reconstructed. So, the masked figure would push his way through the younger generation, giving them no time of day.

He had decided, to be done with conversing for now, especially while there was work to be done. The book and pen, would be placed within his equipment. Before he would finally speak, a low and dark voice would come out of his mask.

<font color = white>&#34;If you wish to fight each other over some trivial matter...then proceed.

But, if you wish to show me your value and worth to the village...then it&#39;s time to put your actions where your mouth is. In but a few moments, I am going to begin Reconstructing our Bridge that was blown up by those damn Dakuteika heathens.

So, either help...or get out of my sight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) Their answer was that final straw for the blonde. Her hands moved from their pointing, relaxed positions and instead dropped to her side. Just like the day(s) prior, they slowly began to curl themselves into fists. She took a singular step forward, the wraps around her soles pressing against the concrete.

     <font color = white>&#34;Just don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you an out, runt!&#34;</font>

It takes only a jolt for her to take off into a full fledged sprint. Step after step is made in dangerous approach of the youthful one. With her target locked, there wasn&#39;t exactly anything going to stop her from making her way over to them.

Just how would they respond?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Don't end up like wedgie-boy from yesterday.

With the stealthy talents of the mask figure, he could easily places it in the shadows in the uzumaki's line of sight to catch his attention. Summoning him to where ever the cloth placed, serving as a marker.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: A punishment for what exactly?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: For a senju not doing anything?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) looks around attempting to find a way out of this situation. What kind of odd request was it to have them remove their shoes. They would not be subject to suggest indignity.

Continuing to move back towards the bridge. They would scan their environment looking for a way to defend themselves from the encroaching assault.

<font color = white>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just go away and leave me alone.&#34;</font>, he said, continuing his retreat.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) One by one, her hands swung with those galavanting strides. Each audible step just gave a warning and reminder of the damage she was capable of inflicting. To step back was to delay the inevitable.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one making this harder on yourself&#34;</font> She calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would turn around, staring at the afro haird child as he seemingly ripped off a piece of cloth with his clan&#39;s crest on it. The masked figure didn&#39;t even move his arm upwards to take the cloth. Instead, he would look straight through the sole of the Uzumaki.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need a piece of cloth to summon you. If I find myself in need, I will take The Commander above a Student. Like I have said before...I am watching you all. Waiting to see which one of you, and only one, interests me the most. I would suggest, focusing on your training for the next year or so.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) starts to sweat as the hag closes the distance between them. He had not properly thought through his retreat. Now she was upon him, his mind was blaring red alarms as the memory of her monstrous strength sent a shiver down his spine.

<font color = white>&#34;I won&#39;t be bullied by some hag!&#34;</font>, he said defiantly, attempting to weave a set of handseals. If successful, two clones of the child would appear in a puff of smoke on each side of him.  Though they would not move, as if all were frozen in place with fear of the impending strikes.
