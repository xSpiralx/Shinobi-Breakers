He would make sure to lock the door, before finally taking off the Mask, and setting it to the side. Of course, his facemask would still be on him, as well as the contacts that he would be using to hide his true eyes. He would begin to go over the papers that came with this job, looking things over like the Infrastructure of the Village, the Reconstruction of the Building. Paying for these repairs...before going over to his secret drawer.

He would open it and pull out his notebook, writing things down into it about his conversations with some of his Students today. He would place his notebook away, making sure that the drawer would be locked, and unable to ever be opened unless it was through his very own chakra signature.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) would let out a soft sigh as he still began to go through the massive of piles of papers that he had to look over, fill out and get to. This would take him a couple of hours...but, at least he would be dedicated to doing all of it until it was done. Though...he did have to admit, this was somewhat of a major headache to him. He just hoped that The Commander could whip his shinobi into tip top shape. He expected to see the results of his leadership and training skills within the couple of months.

Though...he also knew that he would have to hold a meeting soon, so that his forces could be well aware of exactly who he was and what he was doing within the village. He knew that he would have to even train with his military forces sometimes, and make sure that they would suffice in a fight against their rivals.</font></font></font>

At last, the duo reached for the first man they managed to find inside the building. Atkin's senses grew weary, breaking the back-to-back formation with the black haired teen so the two of them had the Amegakure's Executioner as their target.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) blinks a bit, tilting his head to the side. His body was hidden behind multiple layers of clothing. It was hard to tell exactly everything he had on, and the mask....the mask in which covered his very face. Not even eyes could be seen through the very slits. However, they would hear a deep growl, followed by a deep sigh. When speaking, a rich but dark and deep voice would protrude from the mask. Albeit, it almost sounded hollow due to what he had covering his face.

<font color = white>&#34;This is not the Academy. You&#39;ve stumbled upon the Kage Mansion, hence the Kage Manor you have trespassed into....&#34;</font>

He would state, before looking towards the two.

<font color = white>&#34;Trap? I am not here to harm any of my forces, rather oversee their growth within the first year.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: ....

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) would look towards her new friends with panic shining through her eyes... before doing the only logical thing after finding out you had trespassed on the Kage&#39;s manor...

&lt;b&gt; BANG! &lt;/b&gt; Her knees hit the flooring tears in her eyes. <font color = white>&#34;Please don&#39;t disbar him from the academy it was an accedint! It was my fault, I braught it being a fake academy first, and how it was suspicious, so I goaded him into going further! Y-you can disbar me instead!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shanin(The black haired teen-Toopher2) OOCs: (sadge)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#333333>Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) felt the world falling upon him, as the MINUSCULE chance that that very man was one of the guards of the Kage Manor, and the two had had the brightest idea of invading it uninvited --- were the two of them to be taken as a menace by the man?

Atkin would bring his face back to the black haired teen, cursing that very rock-paper-scissors game that got themselves there.

   <font color = white>&#34; --- CURSE YOU, NORTH!&#34;</font>, he said so while facing his partner in crime.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Amegakure's Executioner(The executioner-CConlin216) OOCs: (Alright, reading now. Had to set up profile.
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: NO! We are both guilty!
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: B-bu-
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: Only if... I had paid more attention to our backs!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) although she didn&#39;t stop kneeling, and the tears kept bubbling in her eyes, a small happy smile appeared on her face before falling. <font color = white>&#34;No - no! I was the one who thought we should continue after thinking it was a trap.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: ARGH! Only if we had gone south instead.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) would listen to the two, before tilting his head to the side. He found the duo to be quite whimsical and even...ammusing. He would head over into another room, before grabbing out his papers. Looking through the roster of the Village, before pulling out their Shinobi Records. His voice, still coming through as that dark, deep but rich hollow tone that they could both so clearly hear.

<font color = white>&#34;Atkin....and Shanin. Students of Amegakure?&#34;</font> He would question, before continuing on.

<font color = white>&#34;Neither of you are going to be punished. I could give a flying fuck that you have stumbled in here on accident, or on purpose. What I need you to do, is only one rather simple thing.&#34;</font> He would say, before pausing for ever but a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;What is it you wish to accomplish in your life as Shinobi? What is it, you seek to become upon your journey to that of being Capable Genin in my Military Force?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) the tears shined even harder in her eyes as the man said they wouldn&#39;t be punished - but they did not fall! <font color = white>&#34;I enrolled because I was told I have lots of chakra sir... so I wish to become a strong Ninjutsu using shinobi so that I can protect Amegakure, my friends, and comrades! I want to grow strong enough that my friends don&#39;t have to look out for my back in fear, and instead stand side by side me... sir!&#34;</font>

All the while she was still kneeling on the floor, a guilty look slowly fading on her face as she grew more and more impassioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) increases their chakra by Full - 9 / 9.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#333333>Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) grew amazed by the forgiving nature of that very man. To think that they&#39;d invade the kage&#39;s manor and leave with every single limb that they first came with? Crazy!

After hearing that they weren&#39;t doomed, Atkin would bring his face to Shanin once again, showing off the biggest smile he&#39;s achieved to this day.

It didn&#39;t take long until Atkin came to his regular self, confronted by the question directed at him and his partner. After all, they were only looking for the academy to begin with.

   <font color = white>&#34; --- Very much, sir! The two of us were looking for a way inside the academy, but it seems we have strayed from the right path. Please, do guide us onto the right way!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: I fear I don't have such a perk as hers, but I will provide to them on my on way! I have been studying really hard ever since, and my creativity, historical knowledge and logical thinking shoukld be crucial in the battlefield.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Atkin(The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) OOCs: (I will provide to the team*

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) would look towards Shanin as she spoke, nodding as he heard her telling him about how she had some great reserves that were to be noted. As well as the fact she wished to become some type of Ninjutsu Specailist. As for Atkin, when he spoke, his visage would focus on him. The masked man waiting and staying quietly to let the duo speak.  It had seemed one of them was...smarter than your average shinobi. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hm...very well. Since you both answered my questions with pure honesty and integrity, one shall forgive this little mishaps of stumbling within my room.&#34;</font>

He would nod, before moving closer towards the two, his dark deep voice turning that to nothing but a whisper.

<font color = white>&#34;The next time it happens though, you will be unable to train due to being in a coma for a weel. Do we have an understanding?&#34;</font>

He would question, if they both nodded yes, he would simply proceed to show them to the Academy.

<font color = white>&#34;As for our meeting of today, forgive me for being absent within the first couple of days. I was out of our village, handling some important matters.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Yes sir! Thank you sir!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) Would hurriedly stand up.</font></font></font>

There is no attempt at blocking Sogeki's calculated Shurikenjutsu.

<i>Swoosh, thud... thud...</i>

The set of wooden Shuriken succesfully imbed themselves into Higane's right shoulder, left leg and right arm.

Not a single sound exits her mouth.

He would then change from a flat open palm to more of a gripping hand gesture. Those around him would see for just an instant each individual finger light up purple. The second after, the palm was slammed against the boy's stomach, sealing his chakra usage.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) makes his way out of the Kage Manor, continuing down to exit the entire Mansion. Before making his way to the Central Point of the Village and finally, heading up the staircase, right to the Academy. Once there, he would turn around and look at both Atkin and Shanin.

<font color = white>&#34;This is where our Academy is located. I hope you both remember our little arrangement and keep it in mind. I look forward to checking up on your progress of training soon. Don&#39;t let me down Atkin, Shanin, alright?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#1c1c1c>Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) bows again at the man.

   <font color = white>&#34; --- YES, SIR! THANK YOU, SIR!&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: I don't even play the guitar, by the way.
<br><font color=red>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) nods towards the two. Before looking towards Atkin.

<font color = white>&#34;You can seek out the Jounins, or even the Chuunins. However, I hear The Commander; an Uzumaki looking Veteran is in the process of training anyone that wishes to seek it. Show whoever you go to, the utmost respect and follow their methods, whatever they may be.

Failure to do so, is a failure to learn how you are going to deal with me when I handle your trainings and send you on missions.

Am I being clear enough?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Sir, yes, sir!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) would retreat back into his Kage Manor, continuing to go through his papers that came with the job. Dealing with the finer things of amegakure...like how a Kage should be dealing with their papers. Overseeing the critical infrastructure and allocating the momney where it's needed to be. Just doing a lot of important paperwork that needed to be done. He wasn't even halfway through....he wasn't sure if he had made a dent in the pile, or not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) could feel his stomach rumble, so he would go over to his fridge and pull out some chicken. Cutting it up on a cutting board, seasoning it and deep frying it. Before pulling off all the meat from the very bones, and discarding them in the trash. He would then make his own ramen bowl, and put the deep fried chicken into the bowl itself. Sitting down to eat dinner and watch some TV.</font></font></font>
