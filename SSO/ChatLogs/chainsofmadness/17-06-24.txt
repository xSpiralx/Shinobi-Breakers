<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Mysterious Stranger (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) rests with his hands and arms very nearly exposed, as shinobi begin to appear to the gate his eyes don’t narrow. His gaze does avert to them however.

His hands clearly rest upon two swords - one of which be a samurai sword and another which lie on a regular katana. A voice that sounds mechanical yet fluid seems to speak out, sounding more high pitched than expected. And like it had gears turning behind to make the voice.

<font color = white>&#34;This is...home now...&#34;</font> He whispers under his breath, looking amongst the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Hear ye, Iwagakure!</b></i>I’m an envoy of the Dakuteika - sent with a warning.&#34;</font>

He stops to see who amongst them would be the lead for the message. But since the other one that got sent to Amegakure never returned, he was heavily armed.A step backwards with a motion forward, for whoever would see themselves the leader amongst them to step forward and take a look behind him at the ten bloodlied headbands.

<font color = white>&#34;These belonged to some of your own, younger...<i>ones</i>, I believe. Much like those among your crowd. This is what happens to you out in the wilderness. You leave your village, and you enter <b><i>our</b></i> territory&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Sakujak, Ryohei (The short-tempered youth-Kwaj874) kept his gaze trained upon the man situated at their front door, his arms folded over his chest. With his eyesight, he&#39;s able to pick up on the man&#39;s items from afar.

Two swords, and a bunch of bloodied headbands of the fallen. It causes his expression to sour. The message was heard loud and clear-- an obvious threat.

<font color = white>&#34;Those headbands...&#34;</font> he says, kicking off of the wall to land down below. He commits the man&#39;s face to memory, not crazy enough to pick a fight without tools of his own.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana listened intently as the mechanical voice filled the air, her heart pounding with fear and determination. She observed the envoy steadily, taking in every word and detail. Her eyes briefly flickered to the bloodied headbands, a surge of sorrow, but she remained silent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) wasn&#39;t quite sure what was going on so for the most part she intended to remain quiet and observant, seeing as a Chuunin was called, this certainly wasn&#39;t her place to step forward or engage in any fashion. Being as short as she was, it was a bit tough to see through the crowd so she stepped forward somewhat to get a better look of things.

It was declared that some of the headbands belonged to their own. She cut a sharp gaze toward the &#39;messenger&#39;. Though unknown to her, she was visibly irritated that people from her home had been cut down. Someday her and her friends would be out there.

<font color = white>&#34;Tch...&#34;</font> still she remained quiet.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) lip curled, she was in no place to speak on such matters but she could not help but say something loud enough for her peers to hear. 

<font color = white>&#34;There is only one of them.&#34;</font> She pointed out and looked at the back of the older Shinobi. Would such an offense be let to pass? They had the bodies....but she was one of those bodies herself....</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) looked at sensei as soon as the headbands.<font color = white>&#34;So we are next? I hope not. But you got it.&#34;</font>The teenager seemed too calm and not stressing over the situation. He had full hope in his sensei to beat this guy to death. Taking out his book he would sit down and turn a page. He then noticed Shuye arrived and waved.<font color = white>&#34;Oh hey Shuye you came to the party or warning of this guy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Calmness remained with him throughout the stiff warning.

A Swordsman Messenger declared those he represented an enemy of their entire village. The foremost thought on his mind, reflected from a statement like that, could only be...

<font color = white>&#34;Their days are numbered.&#34;</font>
A soft, muffled murmur, beyond earshot.

More importantly, he&#39;s eager to see whether their superiors might shoot this messenger, who arrived here bearing the highest of hostilities. It was only karma. Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka)  From a squatting position, the girl would begin slapping the ground with three hands to voice her disgust for this kind of attitude!  This was sounding much like a threat, as if he was bragging about killing their genin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ayyo!  How brave!  Killing genin younger than yerself, must feel nice, ye?  Then coming to our gates?  Bragging?  threatening?  Ay ay ay ay.   Message recieved.&#34;</font>

Yeah, this Tsuchigumo girl was pissed, she was ready for a fight!  BRING IT!  Though as for making decisions or actions?  That&#39;s left to Bathroom Sensei.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) couldn't really see the bloody headbands because; his eye sight was awful, and because there were a bunch of people in the way. So the weight of the man's threatening speech didn't really land with the generally dumb boy.

But he did at least still understand it was a threat. It sounded like people had been caught by... bandits? Probably bandits. Outside the walls or something similar. A mostly uneeded warning for Hideo as he had no desire to go beyond the walls to begin with.

The guy had a bunch of swords, for example. What did he have? A cool rock he found on the way here and some loose change. It would take a long while before he was confident and geared enough to much further than he was right now. But he would go that far eventually.

Someone had to avenge who ever the messenger had, probably, killed.</font></font></font>

As if he were filled with churning devices, and maybe even a static charge that slightly irradiated from him somehow.

To those with ever keen sight, his body had very clear grooves but not like the carving of wood into puppetry - it was more refined and held smoother parts.

He glances towards the ground for but a moment, as if stepping carefully for some odd reason. With those having their eagle-like sight though? The area was littered with hundreds upon hundreds of explosive tags - all the way to the gate

If he was going to face an attack here, he at least had an ace up his sleeve. The actions were entirely dependent on Iwagakure though, as he attempts to let them collect and be on his way</font></font></font>

Shuye's talents were lacking in this department. She was not particularly observant; she didn't have the uncanny ability to sense the energy in things her brother had, either. Worse, she was barely a genin, physically. No, explosive ordnance disposal was far beyond her capabilities.

She wouldn't have spotted them without another shinobi calling it out.

A traitor to the village, daring to come to the front gates...?

Was Iwagakure so weak?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) approached the scene, her eyes scanning over the crowd carefully before noticing someone outside of the gate-- Of course there was.

A sigh escaped her as she leapt overtop of the students, landing next to Chocho. Turning to face her for a moment, a smile is flashed, followed by a peace sign. She then finally turns her attention onto the stranger at their gates.
 <font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, she called out, looking him over from head to toe.

The camera in his eye was instantly spotted, alerting her to put her guard up. Perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps someone was actually coming to spy on them. Either way, it was work she didn&#39;t plan on having to deal with.
 <font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re just dropping stuff off, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font>, she began, her eyes looming over to the field behind him, noting the vast amount of explosive tags that were placed.

 <font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;know.. Someone has to clean those up, and it isn&#39;t gonna be me!&#34;</font>, she protested, venting another sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever..

As she lay there, trying to catch her breath, doubts began to creep into her mind. Was she really built for this shinobi life?

Unless saved by the Chunin.</font></font></font>

She was now...super big...one arm went to the one arm went to the right. It was more to stop the shockwave from reaching them...taking on all of the force!

HOwever...as the smoke settled..she noticed that the commanding man was gone...high into the wind...maybe feelings..unfounded..mm..un found....she then waved her hand to clear the smoke residue...as she watched their now broken stair case...probably covered in crystals...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) vents a <i>massive</i> sigh as the explosive tags begin to detonate outwards in. Perhaps it was time for her to actually take this situation seriously.

 <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s like.. The uncoolest thing you could&#39;ve done, random dude.&#34;</font>, she protested. Her hands came together, weaving through a flurry of seals.

With a clap of her hands, the Shingen musters all of her Chakra into the air above the tags. <font color = white>&#34;Doton: Otoshibuta!&#34;</font>

From out of thin air, a massive lid forms, hovering over the field in front of the group. The surrounding area was of no concern to her, the wall was far too sturdy for any amount of explosive tags to take it down.. To an extent.

The shadow that loomed over all present only lingered for a moment before beginning to shrink at a rapid rate. Anyone who&#39;d not yet realized a giant lid spawned in the air would quickly notice as it began crashing down towards the ground, sealing in the impending explosion.
 <font color = white>&#34;Man.. One of these days I&#39;m gonna need to get paid more... This is getting ridiculous..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

In turn? He drives a speedy jab directly for the kid&#39;s sternum.
<font color = white>&#34;Not bad. I can tell you hit decent hard.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) looked like a wreck, with the sun looming over Iwagakure, blinding the child. It's easy to assume that the child doesn't get out much. Blinking twice in a slow manner, the pocket mirror is placed away into a pouch as the 5'3 child continues to watch the proceedings of those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) flickered towards his son, kicking up a gentle waft of dust, before kicking him into the water with a sideways kick.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) was in the process of holding out the crystalline monkey to Shuye as he&#39;s kicked in the chest. A pathetic grunt is shouted out as he is sent straight into the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Guh!&#34;</font>

Unfortunately he was a big kid and his clothes were now soaked. So rather than simply swim back to edge like a normal person; he flailed around helplessly for a few seconds. Splashing water everywhere and toward all those nearby. Before eventually realizing the moat wasn&#39;t very deep.

And remembering that he could walk on water. With a sigh he plants his hands on the surface of the water and pulls himself up and out. Shaking in place like a dog, trying to get rid of at least some of the water. Which, was almost entirely futile.

Grumbling to himself he returns to his spot and glares at his father.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to call me a bastard too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Before the wind hit the back of her kimono from the man's movement. He was in the water before the surface tension broke and bubbled. But still, Shuye had her hands out, and managed to catch the monkey before it fell to the ground. Would it have shattered? Probably not. But they didn't need to know.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) smiles brightly as she holds up a single seal. In that very moment, the ground beneath Hideo would begin to crystalize, slowly crawling up his legs.

Well, slowly to her. To him? It was a near instant encapsulation!

As it finally reached up to his neck, she stopped the crystals and turned to Mugen.

Before being cut off and entombed in a gemstone prison. His smooth brain now perfectly immoratlized in crystaline form.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Blankly staring at the iron vessel and the pale-skinned girl, the child only had the energy to blink in a lazy manner, with cruelty on full display. Getting involved might result in their scandalous activities being directed towards him after all.

As crystals crept up Hideo's frame, the reticent young boy confirmed their insanity, taking solace in the natural concealment offered by the bark of the rather large tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The lumberjack, jack-Kristuria) begins to tirelessly swing a large axe at the tree before him. He didn't have a permit and this was illegal.</font></font></font>

He approaches the boy hiding behind the tree, mostly obscured. The man had very excellent hearing though, and could tell just who was behind there. <font color = white>&#34;Don’t be afraid of them&#34;</font> he says aloud whilst thinking &#39;they should probably be afraid of you&#39;

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Released dread into the atmosphere, metaphorically dampening the air with its mere presence alone. The tired, cold eyes of the hiding boy peered from around the bark. They had become engaged with the Iwa guards. How did the guard ever surmise that the reticent boy happened to be positioned behind the tree?

Shifting a defeated and exhausted gaze to the floor, a steady flow of air is sucked through the hiding one's nostrils. Coming out from behind the tree, the 5'3 boy became more visible, appearing to be frail dressed in comfy clothes and sporting unkempt hair.

No words were offered to the Iwagakure guard, even if the child obliged their request.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa Guard (The masked guard-ChainsOfMadness) looks at the young boy with a smile, though it wouldn’t be seen behind the mask

<font color = white>&#34;Much better, I’ve got some duties to run but you be good now. And no…losing control ya?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) releases the poor boy from his crystal prison. A smile present on her face as she did.
 <font color = white>&#34;Did you have fun?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) loudly gasps as if he hadn&#39;t been able to breathe for the past few minutes. Given that his chest couldn&#39;t actually expand at all his breathing had been really shallow. But now he was free!

He leans forward, planting his hands on his knees as he pants for a few moments. Shaking his head and mumbling,

<font color = white>&#34;That totally sucked...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (and they said shingen aint shit fr
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [don't fuck with kkg clans]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Squinting as sunlight once again harasses his irises, Hitoshi's vision returns and he is met by a boy with one eye covered. As the fellow approaches, they are met with a gaze capable of piercing the soul directly. Kuro ridiculed the reticent one's stealth capability. Unsure of what to do now, the young, frail boy contemplated fleeing.

It's true, to be an exemplary shinobi required a squad, alongside the respect and admiration of fellow Iwagakurens. With a chilling silence, all that's offered is a nod. It's one of acknowledgment.

Kuro and Hitoshi were now best friends.
 Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It's only funny when it happens to someone else Kitsumi...

Forcing hardships onto the quiet introvert only to run away?


The reticent young boy will remember that...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (I smirk in Shingen)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked towards the red eyed girl, his eyes falling onto the crystal monkey. Shaking his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Spending his money on silly trinkets..the apple does not fall to far from the tree..&#34;</font>,he sighed his own spending problems in the back of his mind.

<font color = white>&#34;Infact keep it red eye&#39;s its yours now...&#34;</font>,he patted her on the head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fifty ryo. Down the drain.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Wh- It is not! Dad you can't give away *my* stuff!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Hey! It's not a silly trinket! It's a beautifully crafted crystal monkey!

<font color = white>&#34;I-- don&#39;t know if that would send the right message to him.&#34;</font> Shuye muttered, still awkwardly holding the monkey.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: That sounds like the textbook definition of a silly trinket.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Tch!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [wdym break u just use hiding like a mole]
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Jealousy isn't a good look!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Nah)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It wouldn't work)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It comes from under you)
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Eh? Wouldn't Jealousy require there to be something worth having in the equation? 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: No-No Shuye its yours think of it as my gift to you, for holding it for that moron.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) having finally caught his breath, he holds out his hand towards Shuye.

<font color = white>&#34;Ignore my dad! Thanks for holding the monkey Shuye.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) continued to wait  to hear the other kid speak, but he didn&#39;t speak only nodding his head. Kuro would assume that he just didn&#39;t like talking and just left it at just that. <font color = white>&#34;Not much of a talker I guess, thats fine I can do enough talking for the both of us.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d say as he would get a little bit closer before looking back at the gaurd. <font color = white>&#34;Hey mr Gaurd do you know his name? I don&#39;t think hes much of a talker.&#34;</font> he would say to the gaurd.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) felt ramping anxiety and building tension towards more physical violence. Shuye is paralyzed.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Hideo, if that monkey is returned to you. I will ask Kitsumi to seal you up again.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: I could give it to my little sister, Hideo?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanaka, Ashimiya(The teenager-Dbz563187) OOCs: (hw 2 get moni)

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Helloooo.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Do whatever you want with it Shuye... Hey Tsuneko.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Forced to smile, Kuro met with yellow-stained teeth and dead eyes followed by an illuminated grin. Stepping closer, that smile faded. If Kuro is now the voice for both of them, Hitoshi would have faith.

Blinking once at Kuro, the frail boy extended a hand, attempting to gently tug on Kuro's sleeve.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) pocketed the crystal monkey, somehow.

<font color = white>&#34;It shouldn&#39;t have ended up this way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: The world is a cruel place...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Have you tried fixing your karma?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kamei, Hitoshi(The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) OOCs: (Kuro is met*)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm gonna change my karma for the better... I'm destined for greatness!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True. Great things come to those who do great works. 
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If your luck isn't good, you're literally not destined for greatness.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: In that case you have to go against your fate.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Speaking of great works. How did you do in that brawl?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Quiet Fubuki! I will go against my fate! I'm just that cool- Oh I lost Katora. But I snagged a flag before going down.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: I...I told you to go against your fate you dumbass!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanaka, Ashimiya(The teenager-Dbz563187) OOCs: (gah)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah! I will!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Okay, good.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: But not because you told me to! I was already going to! 
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Not bad. It could be worse. I heard rumors some goofy bunch had a free for all in the girl's washroom of all places.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Well I don't care just do it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I will!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh, yeah that was me.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Chin up. Be glad you weren't them.
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Iwa Guard has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Really? The girls bathroom was a fight spot too?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, I found a boy there and he wanted to fight so we fought.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Me Gosu and Yurei fought in the boys bathroom. What're the odds...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) didn&#39;t do anything while the shy kid was tugging on his sleeves, only looking at him curiously.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah what happened?&#34;</font> He asked questioningly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Then entered an Akimichi, then Yurei.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: We fought for so long we couldn't end our fight before the alarm bell rang, so we just dropped it.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Interesting....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Laaaame, you didn't even finish?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wanted to but there was an emergency going on.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh yeah the explosions and the weird guy at the gate.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You would not have beaten Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair. As for me... I just stood in one place and fought whoever dared to try me.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Did you end up winning Katora?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Right in the middle of the hall. In plain sight.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Meixun and I couldn't beat each other so we teamed up against other people.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Nice, congrats man!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Didn't lose a single ribbon.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I lost no ribbons either.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) The frail  boy is now exceptionally close to Kuro, close enough for the other kid to pick up the powerful scent of coffee. He raises a single thin finger, pointing it towards the larger group. At this point, the reticent young boy's stomach is turning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A pity we didn't get to fight. If I recall? You handled the game pretty well too, Tsuneko.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah I bet having six arms is a pretty cool advantage.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: Yeah theres people over there.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: haven't really talked to any of them though.
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: ......
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I would have lost for sure, if you decided to gang up on me with Reilin.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: the redhead looks intimidating though...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hideo, just so you know I was hunting for you. But alas.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) nodded, kuro has a good head on him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You were? Ha, I knew you liked me.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You're literally a brat.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: How dare you. I am the total opposite! And am, in fact, super cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Peaked around Kuro only to see all of them standing idle, there's a feeling of unapproachability.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Right, the kid who gets bullied by his father constantly.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wouldn't a brat be spoiled? I'm literally the opposite of spoiled...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It must be what they call a 'tough love' parenting style. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: My dad literally just gave away something I bought with my own money!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm destitute even!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Not necessarily spoiled. Maybe rat fits better though.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It's only fair. You probably owe him like fifty-thousand ryo for all the clothes and food he gave you until now.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I don't owe him a debt for being his son!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You're in debt, Hideo. I'm sorry to break it to you like this.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah you're fifty thousand into debt, you're fucked.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-No way...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I don't even have fifty ryo anymore...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You spent your last fifty ryo on a crystal monkey.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yes, yes I did.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just do the obstacle course ten thousand times.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Only for it to end up with a girl you're not even friends with. Life is cruel,...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: W-We're totally friends Shuye...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It'll all work out. Just got to work one-thousand times harder.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm already working a million times harder than most of you! What do you mean another thousand times?!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: But if it's what I have to do... I'll push past my limits!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks at the group and back at The reticent young boy; he noticed that he would constintly look at the group but wouldn&#39;t actually go towards them.

<font color = white>&#34;we&#39;ll have to talk to them eventually, they are around our age, we&#39;ll probably see them around from time to time.&#34;</font>

Turning back to face the group he&#39;d attempt to grab at the kids sleeve inorder to bring him along.

<font color = white>&#34;we should go say hello.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm working one-thousand and two times harder, sucks to suck man.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) quirked a brow at Hideo.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh... okay, if you want to be friends, okay then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah well your forehead is big is Fubu- Oh cool, sounds good to me Shuye.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Not as big as your dents.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Take that back right now...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nope.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Hideoo has dents?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: The dents aren't even something I can control!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: One thousand times the forehead space versus one thousand times the skull dents. Who will win?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I will, Katora!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: What's with my forehead now?!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nothing's wrong with your forehead Fubuki.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: It's a nice forehead.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Thanks, very cool.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Perhaps you could rent advertising space on your forehead.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Dude. I do need five hundred ryo though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fubuki, the billboard of Iwagakure...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: In this economy? Not a bad option.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24)  soft silk sweater is grabbed by Kuro as he successfully manages to steal away Hitoshi to pursue the frivolous endeavor of meeting new friends. Stricken by anxiety and a shred of embarrassment, the reticent boy doesn't offer a verbal objection.

So he must be fine with it!
 Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I mean we're all broke, I don't think it's that humiliating. Anything for a Katana...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kamei, Hitoshi(The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) OOCs: (A soft silk sweater*)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Nothing humiliating about it. Do what you gotta do!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, no one will be laughing after I bonk them with a sword.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Very true.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: You could-- uhm, maybe find a job at the ramen stand? Or the tea shop?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) Kuro would take the boy and would run towards the group pulling the boy behind him, after a few seconds they were next to the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, I&#39;m Kuro and me and my friend just wanted to say hello to you all.&#34;</font> He said before looking at his new friend.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: They might like that you're so-- uhh, tall.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I mean. not tall..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I need to make more friends too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I 'unno, I think I'm still too young for a job.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Except...we can become shinobi as kids...huh.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Jobs are good...  Ramen...  Mmm.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Fubuki do you make sammishes?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) nearly tripped during the approach to the group present. F, forcing his head down for a brief second before looking back up ato the crowd.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) leans forward and waves to Kuro and the boy beside him.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Er.  Sandwiches.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks to Kuro and his friend, waving for a moment with a light smile.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You're the second person to ask me for a sandwich. The first one was a cunt.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: A what now?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But you seem nice so sure I wouldn't mind making one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) is only capable of granting a chilling silence. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) hummed, suddenly hungry.

<font color = white>&#34;Food...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) placed his attention on the duo delivering a greeting to the masses. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. I&#39;m Katora. Fuma Clan.&#34;</font>
His introduction is accompanied by a lazy lift of hand. Barely a wave before his arm fell slack at his side.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) asks: o-oh?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Do you have snacks, sensei?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) waved at the duo once they showed up, she was looking kinda mad thinking about whether her forehead was too big or not.

<font color = white>&#34;Sup Kuro and his friend, I&#39;m Fubuki.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: i...
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: Its nice to meet you too, Katora, Fubuki, Hideo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) reaching into her judo kimono..she slowly pulled out!...

a chocolate bar..and..a couple of bags of chips</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [hmm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked at the snacks, then at Choko.

Were they for sharing? Probably not...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Managed to catch the blonde lad's lazy hand lift with his peripherals. It's then, after Fubuki introduces herself, an angry aura puts the reticent young boy on guard in an instant.

Not knowing how to respond, the frail one peered to Kuro. 
He took the words right out of Hitoshi's mouth.

With an unintentional head bop, Kuro's newfound friend reveals a bag of ground coffee beans. Scooping a couple right into his mouth, the reticent young boy continued to stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would slightly distracted for a moment as the had a new obstical course idea in mind...

But her motions continued to hold up the chocolate bar for them to take and a bag of chips!

As for what brand of choclate it was..she began to speak..as she held it out first.

<font color = white>&#34;chocolate and love..hearts entwin..sweetness divine...aroma..of coca fine..mhm&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;however its slightly bitter..it also contrasts with sweetness...a delecate balance mm...oddly..of true innocense and bliss..&#34;</font>

The brand of the chocolate bar..red Fujiya. <font color = white>&#34;mm..s-sorry..it came to mind mhm dont worry i wont go on a monologe about chips now..&#34;</font> A light akward laughter was later given mhm..as she hold it out for them to take there after!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) took the chocolate bar!

She didn&#39;t seem to mind the sweetness of the chocolate, or the bitterness of the cocoa that flavored it. <font color = white>&#34;What does that word mean?&#34;</font> She asked, pointing to Fujiya on the wrapper as she munched.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: m-mm..good question..if i remeber correctly..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks over to the other boy and sees him cugging down scoops of ground coffee down his mouth. <font color = white>&#34;huh you must really love ground coffee, must taste reall good for you to down it like that.&#34;</font> He said to the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;hey if you like it who am I to judge, might want to slow down though.&#34;</font> he said to the boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) reaching into her pocket, she took out a piece of paper.

<font color = white>&#34;hmm..a-ah..its a word..that is an extention of Fujiyama..which translates to..volcano..or volcano mountain....which is rather smart..since our headband..is a rock....&#34;</font>

She paused as she found her next answer

<font color = white>&#34;t-though...i didnt know..they thought that deep when..about it..mm it it might be another one of the shogans words..oh..branding....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24)  // Liking pure ground coffee? Hitoshi's head tilted in amazement at that remark. With a dead tired expression, the stash of ground coffee is presented to Kuro. A gift to celebrate their extended friendship.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) was of sharp visual acuity. The Silent One&#39;s abnormal choice of snack does not evade his sight. And yet. He only finds it in him to stare, rather than question the whys. It&#39;s rude to point out oddities in others, says his sense of decency. Besides. Someone else did it for him. 

No answer came. A mute? Maybe.

In the meantime?
<font color = white>&#34;So.. you didn&#39;t win your brawl. But. Did you lose any ribbons?&#34;</font>
He asked the lavendar-haired Swordswoman in Training over there a question.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: t-that..reminds me..
<br><font color=red>*Hanaka, Ashimiya has switched their status to On Mission

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was kinda busy doing absolutely nothing before the evil pebble thrower caught her attention. Like last time she jumped next to him to not have an akward distance between them.

<font color = white>&#34;Nah, but it&#39;s all thanks to Meixun. He sacrificed one of his ribbons for mine. That being said, did you lose any ribbons?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) would accept the gift of the ground coffee; it was gifted to him from a friend so it'd be rude of him to reject the gift.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a shake of head.
<font color = white>&#34;Not a single one.&#34;</font>

A moment is spent holding his chin in thought before he asks something more. 

<font color = white>&#34;You went with the squading-up strategy? I would have placed money on you going solo. Or did they decide to become your follower and support your climb to the top?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would find herself thikning for a moment before the sturned to leave the area.

<font color = white>&#34;il...be right back&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shaked her head at all of those.

<font color = white>&#34;I was going solo at first, looking for Hideo to kick his ass. Shame he was on the one place I couldn&#39;t go...anyways, Meixun and I were in a stalemate &#39;cuz we couldn&#39;t get each other&#39;s banners so we teammed up against the ones who were gonna team up on us. It was pretty cool.&#34;</font>

Then she looked at Katora, squinting her eyes a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;Why do I get the feeling you just waited until everybody else eliminated each other?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Nii-san

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I feel like almost an hour passed as I was blinking...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It's been a year actually, you've been in a coma.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No kidding...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed the faintest muffled laugh.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m nowhere near that conniving.&#34;</font>

Out of habit, he plucked a kunai from his holster and spins it like a propeller on his index finger, just to keep them occupied. 

<font color = white>&#34;All my encounters were left to fate. I stood out in the open and waited for my enemies to fine me. Granted... I did have extra insurance set up. In the form of a Kawarimi. If you go hunting? You lose the advantage of preparation time. But. No one ever managed to land a clean hit on me, so I didn&#39;t get to use those measures.&#34;</font> 

He gave a shrug.
<font color = white>&#34;I fought twice back to back. One on ones. And then? The final free for all here in the arena.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) let out an exascerbated sigh, looking at his clothing for a few moments. He still wasn't well versed enough to trot upon water just yet, so he'll need to settle with more.... Improvisational practices.

He formulates a few seals he remembered from a scroll read, then he lifted his undershirt, folding the linen neatly into a triangular plate before creasing each edge with both hands. Undoing the metallic string that held his tailed hair in the back--his hair's apparently getting longer--he wraps it around the congruent angle's point, folding that down to support the shape.

All of this was to make some sort of makeshift throwing item, to which the boy flexes his quads to toss off to the other side! Unfortunately for his aim, he ends up hitting Kitusmi, having said item dangle to the ground unceremoniously. Though there wasn't much of any time to react to that, he mosies over toward Fubuki, poking her before hissing a whisper.</font></font></font>

As Meixun got closer he'd hear a very small snore coming from Fubuki, she was standing still and not moving except for her breathing. The boy's poke however woke her up and immediately she looked kinda around, confused and unaware of what was going on. It took her a moment to realize Meixun wanted to talk to her, so she lowered herself to hear him better.

And right after, without waiting for his approval, she&#39;d karate chop his head - it was just lightly hitting his head, not causing any actual damage.

Once more she looked around and realized...Meixun must&#39;ve done a technique!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, so you wanted to show me this r--&#34;</font>

She looked down and saw the boy on the water, simply floating. Not moving. At all.

<font color = white>&#34;MEIXUN?!&#34;</font>

Fubuki went down to grab him in a hurry, desperately trying to pull him up...she thought she had killed him. Even though she was older, the girl wasn&#39;t that strong physically. All she ended up doing was falling towards the pool of water as well, right next to Meixun.</font></font></font>

A frown pinched on his lips before he turned over to Shuye, <font color = white>&#34;Daole shenme daole shenme?&#34;</font> He chanted eagerly.

It&#39;s been a while since either of the Zhu siblings brought up their youngest sister, so whatever the eldest got must&#39;ve been very sentimental.

Now she started actually panicking. She put her hands where the boy was, as if thinking he somehow turned into water.

<font color = white>&#34;M-Meixun? I didn&#39;t hit you that hard did I- AHHHH!&#34;</font>

Fubuki was startled by Meixun&#39;s chanting, who had made it to the other side -- it was like seeing a ghost. Then she blinked twice. Ohhh, Kawarimi, right. Fubuki slowly got up and sighed, now all her clothes were wet - great.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah you&#39;re...uh, you&#39;re welcome...&#34;</font> she sighed while sitting on the floor. Atleast she did help him, technically.</font></font></font>
