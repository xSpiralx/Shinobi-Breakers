<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) turns his eyes to the newcomer, his pupil-less eyes finding him soon enough, <font color = white>&#34;Hey there!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) awkwardly switches stance and faces the black haired male.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Sorry I closed the game by accident)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why are you fan of him?

I am here to insure you guys get stronger at all cost!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: but sir,im not...strong
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) jumps into the air, doing several acrobatic spins mid-air. With a heavy THUD, he lands right in front of the boy. He leans forward, invading his personal space and looked down on him from his great height. <font color = white>&#34;We can fix that for sure! The way to get stronger is to train!&#34;</font>

He suddenly pulled back and took a small hop back, and began to shadow box, <font color = white>&#34;The thing about training is training more!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: W-well....i apperiate the offer,but  after the academy finish i want to be not a martial artist
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But a medical ninja.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Then I can teach you in that regard to!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Huh..Medicine?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Didn't know you were medic ninja too..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: This is also my area of interest, what a twist of fate.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) swiftly produces several sets of shurinken with a flick of his wrist. In the blink of an eye, however,  they disappear. <font color = white>&#34;I am not one! But one of your teachers will be! I can teach you how to wield tools!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh..i can do that..somewhat.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) takes a few steps towards the black haired male and brings her right hand to her chin, her left slowly taps at her hip. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Higane, whats your name? Maybe we will be classmates!&#34;</font>

The girls eyes seem to light up at the mention of the medical arts.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (higane do me a favor and try to teach him a jutsu, I want to see if same-rank teaching is enabled)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will reveal one of the practice shurikens,made out of wood rather than steel.He was practising with it for a while.especally due to how his control of chakra traning was going on.He needed more and more of it,yet he feelt quite weak compared to most</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (Negative.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Ah damn okay, I gotta do it myself)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Najiro.And most likely we will be.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Najiro.. It's a cool nam-- Erm.. Any family or clan name of relevance? Wait.. is that rude to ask?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) taps her chin a few times with her finger, before relaxing her posture once again.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yakushi clan.But its not big as the ones in this village,its more of a family than a clan name
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) does a somersault towards the young man and invades his personal space once more. He peers down on him, looking down at him with a menacing face. After a second or two of intense starring he breaks into a wide smile and places several scrolls in his hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Read these!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Yakushi, Najiro.. Got it! I'm pretty good with names and faces--Woah! Where does he keep em all!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at the white haired male afterwhich they gave him several scrolls.It seemed the contents to be what the academy should teach him,so it was definatly legal to be given these.

Whoever,he only worried if perhaps was too early,afterall,The year just started of his academy lessons.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh,thats the material we will need to learn.Thank you sir.&#34;</font>He will say as he saved them at his small bag.We will definatly learn them,but for now? he decided that he needed time to learn other stuff</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) smiles and puts a finger to his lips while winking at Higane. If she looked closely she could JUST make out some black markings on his chest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (DONT TEMPT ME FKER)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: That's only the first set! Once you master those and master your chakra more, come back for the other set!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Us higher ups have been asked to pass them around!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) was sharp, even without the awakening of her Byakugan, the young pre-teen was born with extremely sharp eyes capable of tracking even the most minute of details..

She easily picked up on the black markings that bore themselves on her Clan leaders chest. <font color = white>&#34;....Hmm.. Yeah. Chakra.&#34;</font> She ideled on as her vision split between the two individuals.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I see.Well,may i ask something?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (check mate)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) took a step back, granting the boy his personal space back. The Hyuuga coul make out Fuuinjutsu markings, with some Fuuinjutsu knowledge they could understand a bit more about it&#39;s purpose.

<font color = white>&#34;Ask away my boy!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Have you seen other students going around the town?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) did not understand what the strange markings meant, but she took a mental note of them regardless before responding to her newly made acquantance. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve seen a few, here and there.. Ah yea, I&#39;m tired myself.. My brother might be around but he has more energy than I do.&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Yes! That is one of the fields that interests me the most.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: When you learn medicine and become skilled would you be willing to show me a thing or two?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sure? though im still a academy student..there is a whole year of studying before im a real ninja
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Tenjin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) turned to face Najiro.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s my name so that you can remember who you&#39;re making a promise to.&#34;</font> he said with a huge smile on his face and his hand extended outward towards Najiro. <font color = white>&#34;What do you say?&#34;</font> he asked to confirm.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will look at the boy afterwhich will say
<font color = white>&#34;Sure,whatever i get the money for them..and nessecary control of chakra&#34;</font> He will give their hand aswell</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) yells: Alright! Sounds like a great partnership to go into the future with!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...uh..okay
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Hey Najiro, what's your favorite hobby?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: hmm...studying?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Kinda why i want to be a medic
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh, That's pretty close to my favorite hobby. Cool
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: But you make it sound like medicine is the only thing people can study.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not really
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its just what i want to study.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh okay.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than that...i need to perfect my control...and do some stuff too
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) stood by the monument at the square, not entirely sure what she should be doing right now, except, perhaps, mingling with the other students.

Orange eyes scouted the area, noticing not one, but two people, likely students as well.

Slowly, her hand would raise, an informal greeting by means of waving at the two was made.
<font color = white>&#34;Hello, are you both students, as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im a student.I belive the person with me is not,well..atleast not very interested in the shinobi life
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand. And likely an understandable feeling as well. For some, at least.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Weird, second DC...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Sorry about that... ^^; )
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not that much of a figther too
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: My name is Najiro,and i hope to be a medical ninja in the near future.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I wonder why I keep DCing..)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) began to make a formal bow this time, as the wishful student introduced himself.
<font color = white>&#34;My name is Hanamura. To be quite honest, I have multiple ideas of what I&#39;d like to move into. I was thinking, perhaps, Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, either balancing it out or having a primary and secondary focus. But of course, I am just a student, so I still have much to learn before I could even begin focusing on something - Or so I&#39;d wager.&#34;</font>

Her hand gently covered her mouth, a soft chuckle escaping her before her hand lowered again.
<font color = white>&#34;But a Medical Shinobi... Quite a, how should I put it... A very important position, at the very least. I hope you succeed in your dream, and I am sure you will if you put your mind to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I really apologise for these DCs...I think my internet is acting up...)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah.Ive had some basic traning into shurikenjutsu too.So hopefully im not too bothering if i ever go to a mission
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its fine
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Practice makes perfect. But it is a good idea to learn how to defend yourself, and potentially others, especially when near or in enemy environments and areas.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Have you learned anything in the academy yet?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Reseted the router/modem whatever. ^^;;; Should be fixed now I hope.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (alright
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I guess no?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Pardon? No to what?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Have you learned anything in the academy yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: That was my question,but you seemed zone out for a second
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, apologies. I'm... I guess I was a bit tired, but I should be fine now. - As for having learned anything, besides some of the village's history, I don't think I know much yet.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: I wonder, though, has the Festival of Water begun yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I don't think it has begun
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Though..i hope it will begin sooner or later.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Excited for it?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Though i need to watch out aswell.On that day i need to have atleast few shirts and pants
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) giggles softly, nodding her head.
<font color = white>&#34;Getting hit by water, or just getting drenched by it, is a hundred percent possibility, for sure. Unless you&#39;re good at dodging or, maybe, hiding.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,im traning my speed outside of my control with chakra,so we will see
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Though,how about you? Are you ready to be hit with water?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I can take it, but I will drench any who drench me, twice as bad. -- Don't ask me how, because I've yet to figure that part out... But all in good fun, of course.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm....Also
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is few students besides us who are around,but they seem kinda...very hardly focused on their stuff
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (aka afk)
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Oh? As in, slacking?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Could be they're taking a breather, though... Maybe they've been studying all day and night.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe.I tried to talk with them but they seemed kinda..zoned out
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Hm? I definitely did just zone out.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: What did I miss?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, hello. Just some talk about the Festival of Water, and our plans for, well, training?  I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: well we talked about the festival of water
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Oh okay. What's your name miss?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) makes a formal bow once more.
<font color = white>&#34;Apologies. I am Hanamura, a pleasure to meet you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Tenjin. The pleasure's mine.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Are you interested in medicine too?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I would have to say no to Medicine, although I do find it impressive and important, I... Would likely be more on the front-lines and, per chance, the one needing medical attention.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) let out a soft, yet somewhat uncomfortable chuckle.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Well then you have found good luck in the form of the two men before you. Sounds like you should get to know Najiro well though since he will become one of the best medics.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) gave a few nods, smiling as she did so.
<font color = white>&#34;I am sure he will be, if his motivation holds and his dedication stands.
But, may I ask, from what I heared you, yourself, might not be as interested in training? Or did I missunderstand that?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I recently had it revealed to me by the head of the Hyuuga clan that I train more often than any academy student.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: My favorite things to do are think and imagine. He referred to those things as training the mind.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I will probably wind up making tools that you use. And he will probably wind up helping you recover.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh? So the opposite? Quite dedicated then? And I see... Well, if per chance you, either of you that is, are looking for a training partner, I would love to apply and offer to join in.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Oh? A Craftsman-in-Training, then? If I understand this well?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Yes. I like the way you speak. Always clarifying and checking for understanding is an intellectual virtue.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,if you will be craftsmen in the future,i will pay you a visit
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I have no doubt that you will. I will be the best around after all.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: As will I. And thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: In any case..what we gonna do for now?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Perhaps the two of you could train together right now.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: All three of us would benefit from that.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: e-eh? You sure?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Of course! 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: As in a sparring match? Or perhaps using tools, equipment, and the likes?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess as sparring parther.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: A match. Seeing what fights will look like will always help me.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: How can I make good tools when I don't know anything about the trade?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Can we contact an admin for set-ups yet? Or is everyone at least at 3/3 points? ^^)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (weird,fishing rod doesn't have description
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (everyone is at 3/3 points
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Good!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (admins atm asleep but go ahead XD they can give you the starting perk for any specialization that doesn't requires prior perks
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That is a fair point, really. But where should we do such? Here, in public, people might not think well of it.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (kenjutsu and medic cannot be given sadly
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is places for it
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (neither can blacksmith)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (which sux)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Oh? You can't get a free spec for crafting?)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: West from here is fine
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (nope because it costs 20 points)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i cannot get free medic cause requires perfect control
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cannot get free ken either cause is 20 points
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Ah, okay. ^^)
<br><font color=red>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Well, then, let us go, shall we?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (huh
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: lets go then
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It's been a while since I played an NRP of this kind/rulesystem, so do bare with me. ^^)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) takes a seat on the ground with a huge grin on his face as he pulls out a notepad and a pen before watching the two of them with widened eyes of excitement.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (same XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i cannot find where was the rule about minimal range of char,so imma just say atm is 5 titles
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (That's fine!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (found it
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its 8 titles
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) inhaled deeply before letting out a long exhale.
Her stance would then be entered. It wasn&#39;t exactly anything out of the ordinary, it was pretty mild, inexperienced, but likely allowing more of a defensive movement than being more of an aggressive stance.

<font color = white>&#34;I am ready. But let&#39;s keep this as a training; No breaking limbs. I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to mention this, especially to someone educating themselves to be a medic, but, some people can get... Too into it, I guess?&#34;</font>

There she stood, ready to begin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I see..at any case,im ready
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Yay! Position Markers. No need for clothing to be put down. x) )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will begin to move too,he was slower,but still had somewhat of a fast reaction with them</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (tbh unlee you have projectile the speed stat atm isn't needed.For moving that is XD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) smirked, she'd change her pathing a bit, tilting lightly as she moves a diagonal path towards her opponent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would charge and go straight to her.After he did that he prepared for  the female next move</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) had her smirk fade slightly, a half-formed smile, if it could even be called that, was now visable.
The match would now actually begin, the two of them would clash, leaving any bystander to ponder who'd win.

But victory, for either, was still far away. It had only just begun!

Thus, Hanamura rushed towards the Medic, and just before reaching him would slide over the ground, reaching the boy only to follow up with a jab towards his right shoulder with her left fist.

[D Agility]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at the attack which was given.It was fast,very fast,but he dodged it,by some miracle,whoever he knew the next attack will hit him clearly.For that the man will go,drop a..fish rod? Why a fish rod.And go one step back.

He had a idea,definatly a idea,but would that work out,considering the woman had huge striking capabilities?

(1/1 evasion used,going back with 1 title and dropping fishing rod item)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) squinted her eyes as her opponent avoided her blow. A given, it was likely they'd be able to dodge, but would they last, however?

She heared something drop, but kept her focus on her opponent for now, even as he backtracked away from her.

She rushed forward once more, before aiming a palm-strike towards the back of her opponent's left shoulder, using her own right palm.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) blinked and then quickly shook his head to make sure that his eyes were not deceiving him in any way.

<font color = white>&#34;Turning his back to his opponent... to protect his fishing rod? No. Not to protect it... but I can&#39;t figure out why he would do that... Especially against someone as quick as Hanamura...&#34;</font> he muttered aloud as he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would be hit,a bit too hard than what he expected,but he was standing still.The man had a thought and a idea.With that they will rush in the nearby direction as they prepared the nessecary seals.

Just what the heck was their idea

(Taking moderate injury aka 1/2 hits to defeat me,1/1 evasion regained,going to the west with two steps afterwhich preparing to do kawarimi)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (how do u know the dmg?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i forgot its strength XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (i mean in general. i dont see it in the combat tab rn)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its at discord

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (oh)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (but i was thinking agility = dmg
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Strength VS Durability with a minimum of Light Injury unless they have a body or monstrous body perk.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (so i guess is pety cause i got E+ end
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ah so light then sorry
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I don't have any jutsu yet. ^^;; )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (tbh you guys were too late,there is a rank which gives them out to any student
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (he gonna be tommorow so i guess later down.Its the basic three academy ones XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I figured. Oh well, admins will arrive eventually, too.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) was quite confused. How did her opponent already know a jutsu? Was she severely lacking in her studies? No, that couldn't be it... She was a good student, after all.

Shaking her head, she pushed the thought away. If she were able to rush in, fast enough, she'd likely be able to hold him down before he could finish his hand seals.

Thus, Hana rushed forth, aiming to leap onto the boy, hoping to grab him mid-leap and pull him with her onto the ground.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (a grab?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Grapple/Grab.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (So I guess a grapple, trying to pin you to the ground.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ah..i mean we in equal strength so...guess no one can get out?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I suppose so.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (but i guess you win that one.It says i can use it when im struck,but grapple isn't strucking i guess XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It is, though.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It just depends on the calculations. I think?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (That's what's confusing me. ^^)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (...hmmm yeah,so you got more agi than me,so i guess you stop the handseals?\
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (like im confused aswell XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (If Handseal Speed = Agility then yes, as the order is Jujutsu > Ninpo as well. x) )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i fail then XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause i got e+ handseals
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Saw the woman rushing faster and faster,was she about to attack him? Nope,she grab him and put him down on the ground.Due to the sudden move he cannot finish the seals,neither break from the grab due to their untrained in martial arts body.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm..&#34;</font>He will begin to think outloud while looking for opportunity,his chakra was a bit drained,but he can keep going if nessecary</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) just reduced their chakra by a cost of E - 4 / 5
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (now need to get ouf of a grapple to attack me XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause neither of us got sealess or grapple moves atm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) seemed to have succesfully pinned the boy down, her eyes squinting at him.
<font color = white>&#34;You already know jutsus it seems. Was it a Ninjutsu?&#34;</font>
There was a hint of envy, but mostly curiousity, in her tone.

Hanamura rolled off of her opponent before getting back up.
Were he to continue the fight, she wouldn&#39;t mind going further.
But if it were ended, then and there, she&#39;d be fine with it too.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..ninjutsu
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I know the basics of the academy
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Wow... Amazing. It seems I did miss a few classes and lessons, then...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: not really
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) yells: Well surprise surprise! Nice!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: One person with milky eyes gave it to me
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: The Hyuuga clan head.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Alongside few other scrolls.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) yells: Interesting!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: as you see...im fragile 
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: or well..not quick enough
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) were the fight to be over, which she now assumed it was, she&#39;d hold out a hand to help the boy up.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not fragile, really. Maybe a bit slow, but definitely not fragile.
Training will do us both good.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe if was more faster...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: on the good side..if you did attacked me i would had switched with the fishing rod
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: ... Switched?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm....Thats how Kawarimi works
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You need a object with the size of your torso..then to be hit
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afterwhich you go at the objects place.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I see... Incredible.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If i used more chakra perhaps you would had taken down a fishing rod
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) covered her mouth with her right hand, chuckling softly.
<font color = white>&#34;That would have been surprising and, well, quite funny.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than that...there is two other techniques i know
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: One is basic disguise..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And the other? cloning
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The disguise can be seen by any capable ninja,is not something hard to notice,but its good if no one is smart enough
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The clone technique is good aswell
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But..is better if use it as a surprize attack
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I see... I hope to learn more about this, soon, as well.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You will.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you fast like this,i won't be surprized  about your capabilities after learning these jutsus
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Eheheh... Well, I'm not sure if I'd be amazing at it. Speed is one thing, control would be another...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah though its the most basic of basics
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: So your control is fine
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Perhaps... Either way, it was a good spar we had. And I hope our 'craftsman' feels the same way about it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Reminds me...i need whatever i go on my first mission,to spend my money on some kunais
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I got some good eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh. That'll come in handy for a medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: You did mention having trained in Shurikenjutsu. I would love to see you use it, sometime.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If i get shurikens that is.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: cause..im pretty sure the academy doesn't allow its students to wield them
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: True...  I suppose we can't, unless we have permission?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Either way, shall we all head back? Who knows, maybe more people have come around and about?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe? we can ask
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And sure..lets get back
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Tenjin, want me to grab you?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (thnx)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (No problem. ^^)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can search around for other people if you guys want to
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, it's no bother really. They will come around when they are ready, I am sure.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Hmm....
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah,hopefully sooner than later
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) appeared to have begun zoning out once again.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll need to come up with a way to get resources for crafting with...&#34;</font> he uttered.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: What kind of resources would you need?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well..untill you get status of genin...no way you going out of here
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not that is impossible,but its way dangerious for someone uncapable of fighting to enter alone,let alone  mine.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That might be true, but he could ask a higher up for help, in return for a one-time cheaper service, or some sorts.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Sure but there has to be another way...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (at this point ima just be a shinobi fr)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It's still early, don't give up. ^^)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (if going for akihibara doesnt lemme get the crafting perk for free then there is no real diff between crafter and a shinobi who learned how to craft)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i will be the strongest medic XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i mean we can go to akibahara when all of us get genin status
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause i was told if we go without being genins or just...atm we gonna be attacked by ecs
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (like the path is dangerious and etc
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (yeah no worries the resources not the problem i was just thinking about the perk cuz its 20 pts)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (So I'll prob be getting it next week if im lucky)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (atm we getting 3 points per day
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I'm sure the admin team can be talked with, if you plan on starting as a crafter and such.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (after this academy arc ends we going with i belive 6-7? 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (Yeah but they have a fair point at the same time. The free spec thing is for specs that cost 4-6 points so it probably wont be allowed to get anything that costs 20) 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (and they probably wont make it cheaper otherwise alot of shinobi will get it)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (True...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (and i think a shinobi life would be more fun anyway so... we'll see how things turn out)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (a support specialist)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (remember is 100% DR)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I don't really know what I should go, really.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (so yeahhh....if die? you die
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (then again..you get full refund so death is not just im becoming weaker
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (im going for shurikenjutsu medic
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (with t2 speed and agility
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (im going blacksmith/medic/fuuin)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I think Nin/Tai for me.)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: imma check real quick if anyone else is awake
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: As i thinked,its just us
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: More will wake up, or walk about outside, soon enough.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: In the meantime...does anyone of you know about the war between the Senju and Hoshigaki?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The..i belive two year war that had happen in the past
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: The one that included the Yuki and Uzumaki as well, I believe?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah that one
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Apparantly Yuki and Hoshigaki are near extinct.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The war between the Ucumaki  allied with Senju,against the Hoshigaki and Yuki clan was huge
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Even though it lasted so little
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Sorry, back!)
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It was, yes... But I am glad it's over. Long over.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Same..hopefully we won't see anymore local wars.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Which reminds me...i haven't seen senju or Uzumaki either at the academy
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Perhaps they get special education?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe? i don't know,but they the most noble clans in our village
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case,im not a noble,so i don't have any idea if we will ever see one of them running around
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, it shouldn't matter much, to me at least.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: And why is that the case?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Sure, the Uzumaki and Senju have founded the village. And yes, they are noble... I respect them all, of course. But, nobility does not compensate towards skills and training. Even a low-class, poor-lifestyle shinobi can rise to great heights. As long as they try.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: So a skill over genetics?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess you might be right.Perhaps if i push myself hard enough..
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Never give up, is what I believe in.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will chuckle at the never give up part.He belived in it,whoever at the same time was unsure if he can never give up,considering he was not a fighter</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Anyway..guess for now i will relax
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That is a good idea...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Also,don't go to the hospital without higher ups permission
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Apparantly there is some..work going on?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh? I see, thank you
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (warper bugged atm for the hospital)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh,a new comer
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Yeah, morning, morning...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Too early... I want to go back to sleep...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) tilts her head lightly to the side as she hears the boy.
<font color = white>&#34;I can understand that, although I personally would not. But may I ask, why would you prefer to sleep?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) rose a brow, before allowing his shoulder to shrug, and drop to his sides. 
<font color = white>&#34;Why not? Sleep is good. A little nap, here and there... You can&#39;t beat it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Everyone seems to be napping anyway...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hmmm... Well, I think you could always rest by the tree? None should scold you or anything for doing so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Tchhhh... Who's going to scald me? It's like he said, everyone's asleep anyway. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That... is what I said, nobody is going to scold you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) blinked. He slowly nodded his head.
<font color = white>&#34;Yeah... Yeah, I&#39;m. I&#39;m tired. The sun&#39;s too bright....&#34;</font>

Without another word, he moved towards the shade of the tree, one hand rubbing at his eyes as he dropped down onto the ground and hunched over in a seated position.
<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you both awake, anyway? You could be sleeping too.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im normally around this time of the day awake
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: As for her...i guess its the same thing?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) covered her mouth with her hand as she nods.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m awake because I wish to train and learn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) wanders into what should be described as a square of sorts.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey.&#34;</font> He greeted the group already there before moving his hands into his pockets.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckled once more as more and more people came to be around.
<font color = white>&#34;Hello, everyone. Nice to see more people around again.
I wonder, though, if the Hyuuga Clan Head will be around, soon, as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) is found staring at the sky, arms across his chest. The voice of the approaching boy snaps him to attention. <font color = white>&#34;Oh... hey.&#34;</font> 
He then looks to the stranger girl. <font color = white>&#34;Why, is there some sort of special occasion?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He gives the scrolls.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) shakes her head slowly, yet her smile would not fade.
Instead, her eyes would scan the two recently arrived.

A green-haired individual, and a black-haired one.
The Green-haired one seemed taller, more mature than herself, or even more-so than the other person.

As for the black-haired one, they seemed feminine, at least, to her.
<font color = white>&#34;Nothing too big should be happening, unless the Festival of Water has begun - But I think it has yet to begin... I believe. As for other activities, it would be the academy.&#34;</font>

The girl moved a hand through her hair before continuing.
<font color = white>&#34;Are you both students as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (hanamura,where did you got that profile code?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (A friend. ^^ Why?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i might need it XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (wondering if it will prevent that discord annoyance of changing their link every couple of days
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) turned to his side, looking at the green-haired male before looking around some more, noticing the shark-boy as well.
He'd raise his hand in greeting towards them, a light smirk visable, before he'd listen to the girl some more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded his head, taking a bit of time to read the soft spoken person on the bench. He took note of the courteous smile, which caused him to stare for a bit too long, but then he quickly averted his gaze once their gazes met. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (The profile sadly won't accept Discord Pictures, hence why my first playby failed. But it should work with other sites' pictures, I think.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (discord nerfed using images
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (u gotta host external now
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) got up from her seat, taking a position more centered on the group, rather than sticking to one side of it.
<font color = white>&#34;I do assume you&#39;re both students, as well? What about you?&#34;</font> She&#39;d ask, looking over to the Shark-like boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (not only images but mp3 files too 
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mmmm-hm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well...is nice to finally see more people.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I'm a student, yes. Yuki, Subaru. Pleasure.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...oh,explains your
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Feminine look
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) offered a nod in confirmation towards the lass, shifting his form to avoid a particularly annoying beam of sunlight breaking through the tree-leaves.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Nice to meet you too, Subaru. I am Hanamura.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked around, taking note of everyone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kusahara. Student.&#34;</font> He said briefly, but with a bit more volume in his voice this time so everyone could hear.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well Hanamura,is seems we found out  other students.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That's correct, yes. And I do hope more will come, as well. Even so, I am pleased to see more and more are waking up.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Either way, nice to meet you, as well, Kusahara.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded in response. <font color = white>&#34;And you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) let out a sharp wan, reclining back somewhat, the pale-skinned individual almost threatening to fall back onto the ground from his seated position. 
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, right. Introductions, uh... Hello. I&#39;m Saigosame. Of the Hoshigaki clan. Just, you know, in case there was any doubt.&#34;</font>, he remarked, following with a brief chuckle at his own joke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Might I ask, have either of you decided on a goal or focus, yet? For myself, I like to train in Ninjutsu and Taijutsu. But I am also still open for learning other paths, of course. - And pleasure to meet you, Saigosame, as well.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nice to meet you all. Good to see a Hoshigaki about, and glad my eyes didn't fool me, heheh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) scratches the back of his head, smirking lightly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank stare to the question stated, looking back up at the sky to find some sort of sign or answer, finding none. In the end he just shrugged, looking at the others and listening to their answers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Ah, sorry, as far your question...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) yells: I suppose Ninjutsu, yes. Maybe some additions for self-defense in close-combat could be great!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: We have one blacksmith and one future medic besides her
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Cool, well, medics are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah,medics and blacksmiths are more uncommon aswell.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Hm... 
<br><font color=red>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=red>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, if any of you have questions, or need anything, feel free to ask. -- Then again, I'm sure we're all on equal level, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: After what ive seen from you Hanamura? Im unsure,atleast for myself
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) noticably entered a thoughtscape that painted his expression a bit grim, but it faded in a few moments, possibly snapped out of it by Hanamura. <font color = white>&#34;I wonder about that.&#34;</font> He would respond to her assumption. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) clapped his hands together.
<font color = white>&#34;You know what? This place needs a map. It&#39;s like a maze, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I agree.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its fine.Perhaps you guys need to go out more
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It can be confusing, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can easily remember it.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Exploring does help.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Be back soon a moment, sorry.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looks at Saigosame with narrowed lips, and shrugs as if to say <font color = white>&#34;I guess it&#39;s just you and me.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I could do with some sightseeing later, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: But it shouldn't be too difficult to remember everything, heh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) took a glance back at Subaru, and let out a defeated sigh. Now as forever, the Yuki and the Hoshigaki were united.
<font color = white>&#34;Man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) noticed the Hoshigaki&#39;s glance, making him blink a couple times.
<font color = white>&#34;Something wrong?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (oh, i'm cooked, that was meant for kusahara. my bad. i misread the chat.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (No worries. xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Huh? No. I mistook you for Kusahara. Listen- I'm REALLY tired.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) closed his eyes and took a deep whiff of the chill dusk air. 
<font color = white>&#34;Getting late.&#34;</font> He muttered to himself. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) eyes Kusahara and then looks down his own form.
<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we do look similar.&#34;</font> He&#39;d jest before shrugging.
<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, all is fine, really.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: More like getting early if you ask me, though.
<br><font color=red>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (god, this 3 pp is vile... 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (BRB)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (i missed wipe start last time i played srp so i was getting catchup and shit, but this.....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Early, late... It's all good time for sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Sounds like you'll need a pillow on your desk at the Academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) said with a slight smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I guess everyone is traning?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If I sleep through the lessons I'll end up super-behind.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or you guys just study inside the academy only
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I'm not some sort of super-genius... You know?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not either,but is good to practice what you have learned.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shrugged once more. <font color = white>&#34;I study on my own, but nothing too serious.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns to acknowledge the newly arrived person.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I see...then,what do you want to do after the academy ends?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Has...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Has the academy even STARTED yet?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank look to that question. <font color = white>&#34;What does a bird want to do when it&#39;s no longer a chick? We are Shinobi, most of us here will be fighting and probably dying for the village.&#34;</font> He said plainly. <font color = white>&#34;Hopefully dying later than sooner...&#34;</font> he added in a low tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It did started.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It will end in a year.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And...not everyone is a fighter.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: It is why I said "most of us here."
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: True..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case..hopefully we meet each other thoughout the year and inside the battlefield.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded and tried to shake off the grimness of his words, almost as if they were not his own. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: By the way, did I not catch your name, or...?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yakushi,Najiro
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I am back.)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Future medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, sorry, I must have been deep in thought, I see we have another fellow student? Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded. <font color = white>&#34;Ah... so you&#39;ll be trying to keep us among the living.&#34;</font> He said with a soft smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked once again at the child in the kimono, who has not said a word since they arrived.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: More of keeping people who are worthy to live.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But yes,trying to keep people alive.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Noted.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I would say all lifes are worthy, really...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) pulled his sunhat over his eyes, mostly to avoid the glaring light of the streetlamp above him.
<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s a kinda weird way of looking at it, I mean... I think choosing who&#39;s worthy of living, that&#39;s not on us to decide as people.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I mean, if I had to kill someone? Sure. But it's not because I chose to, it's because their bad choices in life led them to that moment where karma decided they weren't worthy of continuing on, right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its a certain view Hanamura.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can explain it later..but for now guess i will relax on the bench
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So the recent genin killings were karma too?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man... I didn't hear nothing about that, don't quote me on anything.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked at Saigosame with some seriousness on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: That's been talked about all over the village...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: ... A-anyways...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I wonder if any of the teachers are going to be around soon. It would be amazing to learn more.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: For real? This is the first I'm hearing about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Anyway- Killing for the SAKE of killing is a sure-fire way to end up in bad karma. So, whoever DID do all that will get theirs soon enough.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) let the topic go, as he didn't want to sour the mood further, but nodded at Saigosame in response. Then, he turned to Hanamura. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hanamura,i will see you later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Think to do the whole..zoning out.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Are you alright, Najiro?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: im fine.Just gonna do some..napping
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Very well. We'll talk more later, then.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, I guess the Hyuuga have no trouble seeing at night, so they are fine appearing in the dark.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Ughhh... Hello, mister Sun.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Please shine ANYWHERE other than my face, thank you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) cast a lofty gaze on those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckles softly, looking over towards the Hoshigaki again.
<font color = white>&#34;You really are not a morning, or maybe even day person, are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yamaki (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: No such thing as karma...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shuddered for a moment, as he realized someone was observing them from behind, then turned around slowly.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean. When I get my good and proper eight to twelve hours a day...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Then I'm chipper as can be. Today is not one of those days...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: I'm sorry to hear that. If there's a way I can cheer your day up, I'd be willing to try?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) generalize gaze would slowly hone in on the person seeking eye contact with him.
  <font color = white>&#34;....?&#34;</font> - he tilts his head to the side.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (Back. Freaking cat jumped on my PC's Power Button. xD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) ponders, for a few moments. Eventually, he raises a hand, and points up at the sun.
<font color = white>&#34;Make THAT go away.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) he lifted one hand in a greeting at the newly arrived person. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Kfh, no, I'm kidding. I'm going to head back home and get some actual sleep. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) picked himself up from the ground with a grumble, stretching his arms for a few moments before lumbering over towards the wall to his west. Without a second thought, he steps over the threshhold into the water, and disappears under the current.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) leans his head over ever so slightly in that of a nod.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: He must be -really- tired, huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) took a few more moments to size the fellow student up, then nodded and turned back to the centre of the gathering place.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I suppose so. He was quite tired when he arrived. I suppose he really needs a long nap, then. Which is fine, no classes have begun yet - today at least. As far as I am aware.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Hm? Oh, hey there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) looks from side to side. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay then.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Since there aren't much of any teacher awake or around, should we try to train, like, spar or something?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: ...Oh that's where everyone is.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: And I suppose we could spar, if any of you are interested. Could even make a sort of 'team spar' to see how well we work together. But, do not feel forced to, of course.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns his head back to look at the finely dressed kid, then put up a hand as a greeting.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) muttered something beneath his breath and began advancing forward towards the crowd. Maintaining his silence he'd hope to melt into the group seamlessly as they continued their discussion. However it seemed as though there was about to be a spar between two of the children. 

Closing his distance tween him and the others, the child began assessing the two. Maybe they were the top boys of Amegakure, or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) folds his arms and watches the bout from afar.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets again.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m fine with a spar or anything, really. Team or not. But yeah, I do wish the teachers would wake up and such, heh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm up for it. Would be nice to know what and who I'm working with in the future.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) looked towards the Yuki and the green-haired person before chuckling, covering her mouth as she did.
<font color = white>&#34;Three of us, then... Well, I suppose you two could spar, if you&#39;d like, and I&#39;ll just watch? That is, unless someone would like to join in?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Sure, I'll be up for that. You, Kusahara?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, sounds good.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Well, shal we do it here, or wanna go elsewhere? You got an idea, Hana?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm fine either way, but we don't want to go too far, in case the teacher arrives.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: When I sparred earlier, we went west a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Lead the way, then.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Follow me, hahaha. -- Anyone wanting to watch, feel free to watch along, as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) stretches his arms then follows briskly after the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) scratched his head as he questions as to where the party of children might have ran off to. He two wanted to see some combat. Take a moment to assess the foot tracks left in the dirt, the mild manner boy would take off and began his hunt.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Yakushi, Najiro has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Everyone has left it seems? Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I will have a look around.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Well, a couple of them were hiding in the trees, observing us.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, yes, I did notice such...
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Not sure if they are still there.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, I shall be back soon.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I feel like a wimp after going down like that.
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Yakushi, Najiro has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Don't be like that, you're fine.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly approaches the bench where the other two individuals are situated. Their eyes never averting their gaze away from the bench where they are approaching. She slowly sits on the bench, clasping his palms together and resting their chin on their hands.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) takes a deep breath, the pain in his stomach now only a mild sensation reminding him of his sparring match. As he heard the child approaching and sitting down, his attention was drawn to her. Noting the bored posture, he raised an eyebrow. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) looked towards the child, a slight ponder was made before he&#39;d speak up.
<font color = white>&#34;You okay? Got bored or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly turns their head towards the two boys situated on the opposite end of the bench. His soft features seemingly slightly shimmering against the bright sunlight. A small sigh escapes their lips, as they begin to speak.

<font color = white>&#34;Boring? Yes, I guess that is a good way to describe it. Nothing ever happens around here...&#34;</font>, they say with the tone of an irritant child.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nothing happens? What do you mean? A lot has been going on, and a festival is starting soon, as well...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) frowns slightly. <font color = white>&#34;I would enjoy the peace while it lasts, personally.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a small yawn as they sat near the monument his hazel eyes scanning the other faces nearby</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: All of that is...boring.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So what do you consider exciting?
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Anyways, Kusahara, got any plans?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: I dont know..Something...fun maybe?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turned to Subaru. <font color = white>&#34;Not really.&#34;</font> He said, leaning back on the bench, and turning to the new kid. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, like what? There are many things one can find fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I dont know.. Maybe playing? Like ninja tag!
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Right...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) almost chuckled at that. Despite being thirteen, he already felt like it was a lifetime ago when he found childish things fun. <font color = white>&#34;I mean, I guess that&#39;s fun. We&#39;ll be needing to catch people when we go out on missions anyway, so in a way... it&#39;s training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) slowly rises up and stretches before sighing. <font color = white>&#34;Anyway, I&#39;ll go home and read something. That&#39;s my idea of fun on a sunny morning. See ya!&#34;</font> He&#39;d say and walk off towards his house.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: You need to make room in your life for Adventure, Daigen. you know what they say about all work and no play.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Satetsu, Sogeki(The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) OOCs: (teamviewer is not my friend right now)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess no one gonna answer then

Sogeki fades back into his scene.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: They're planning some sort of sparring tournament.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would avert her eyes else where due to feeling the introduction between the two was over.As she reached into her bag to pull out her lip gloss her radient aura peaked through as the morning rays shined upon her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Ah...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked as a new face appeared beside Daigen, and a gleam popped up in their eyes.
<font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>
They waved a hand at the boy, gazing at them and steeping into their line of sight.
<font color = white>&#34;Wanna join a tournament?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: eheh....im not good for tournaments.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But..i can try
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Perfect. You won't regret it.
<br><font color=red>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) With his focus back on Rose, and his obliviousness to her radiance, he continues to the conversation.
  <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re going to join us, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Everyone is going to have a lot of fun.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (brb going to the store)
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I suppose..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) walked throught calmly, idle, static eyes scan across the seemingly distant scene, the small girl stops her passing, pressing her eyelids gently in an effort to look in the distance to the soft commotion.

A barely audible <font color = white>&#34;Hm.&#34;</font> was given before she&#39;d squish her way throught the bodies to push herself away from the crowd and keep passing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Though,don't try to break eachothers limbs
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: I'm not a follower.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Buut where are you guys going?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Good reason for you to take your stance as a leader and beat everyone else up.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Number One can't follow anyone.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: It's impossible. Which is why, since you're.. you know.. scared.. I'll just take the number one spot.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) smirks.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I doubt any arms will be broken. We have a Chuunin whos going to oversee everything.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: There's other ways to rise to power without needing to be physical.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will give a slight sign.Well atleast he found more students</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The girl is right.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Might is not the only way 
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Some have great minds too.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: She is. Yet.. in every situation, even the smartest of folk have to rely on physical powers. One can't exist without the other.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) yells: Satetsu. We have five people now!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Without strategy and mind...might is nothing but a foolish tactic
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Without might, the execution and protection of the one planning is null.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Mind without body is just theory.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: but body without mind is just being a animal.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looks at the gathering of people as he passes by, and decides to hang around by the waterside.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: ..FIVE!?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: WE NEED MORE, BILL.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Am I counted in those five..

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I dunno.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Possible answer....
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Never mind it's Six now

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: ....Six??
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Well.. okay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) rubs his ears after that shout.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) taps his chin for a few seconds as he deadpans Bill.
  <font color = white>&#34;....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ...GOOD JOB, CABBAGE BOY.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: I'm assuming due to how some of you guys look the winner would just have bragging rights huh?Instead make an entrance fee where you need to give five or ten ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Nothin' is for free.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ...?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Bragging rights and the winning pot is up for grabs.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) coughed, clearing their throat before inhaling deeply.
<font color = white>&#34;Last Call for the Tournament! All who want to join, now your chance!&#34;</font>
They yelled, trying to get the attention of anyone interested.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns around, now understanding what&#39;s going on. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll just spectate.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) asks: You starin' me down?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Maybe I could join...
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I dunno...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Eh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) blinks and looks away,
<font color = white>&#34;Sorry...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: What's the price?
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Are you going to join the tournament? We have a Chuunin who's going to oversee everything.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: May i ask who is that jonin?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) shrugged and went back into her head. She needed to figure out what her aesthetics were going to end up like.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: uhm,i mean chunin
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's Miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh...the crazy one
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: So it's a chance to show them what skills you have and maybe impress a chuunin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) holds in a laugh at Najiro's description of a Chunin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Plus you get to see how you stack up to your peers
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, his mind instantly racing to address Rose&#39;s inquiry with his signature arrogance and pride. This challenge was an opportunity to assert himself and motivate others to step up.

<font color = white>&#34;The way I see it,&#34;</font> Sogeki began, his voice carrying an edge of aggressiveness and determination. <font color = white>&#34;We pool our ryo into a pot. The top three winners of the tournament not only claim their share of the pot but earn the right to brag. But here&#39;s the real deal,&#34;</font> he continued, his smirk widening as his arrogance shone through. <font color = white>&#34;Those top three? They&#39;re not safe. Anyone who didn&#39;t make it can challenge them. It&#39;s about more than winning; it&#39;s about proving you&#39;re the best.&#34;</font>

He paused for a moment, his gaze sweeping over the gathered peers. <font color = white>&#34;This tournament isn&#39;t just a chance to compete. It&#39;s a chance to show who&#39;s at the top and who&#39;s willing to fight to stay there,&#34;</font> he declared boldly, his tone challenging yet encouraging. <font color = white>&#34;So if you&#39;ve got any guts, if you think you&#39;ve got what it takes, step up. Train hard. Because this isn&#39;t just about dominance--it&#39;s about maintaining it.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s words hung in the air, a call to action wrapped in his trademark arrogance and pride. He knew his aggressive approach might rub some the wrong way, but he also understood the necessity of pushing his peers to strive for excellence, both individually and collectively.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Sounds cool.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hm...

<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers: ...so cool
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm...well hopefully the teacher allows us some free weapons
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: She said our wooden training ones are fine.
<br><font color=red>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Does she got wooden shurikens?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would nod their head which would give off the notion that she was considering in joining this little game of theirs.In reality Rose had already made up he mind and figured just by watchng the fight would give her a better out look on things compared to joining the action.

<font color = white>&#34;I see it does sound amazing,but i&#39;m going to have to decline.&#34;</font>A smile continued to linger on her face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Don't we all?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: What do you practice with?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. Cabbage Boy! Did you gather everyone's names
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Throwable stuff.

<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Some shuriken would be cool.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I'm fine with using my fists though.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Wooden ones! I'm not throwing real weapons at you all-- Erm.. nor do I have any.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Names?...oh right names.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) says: I'm Nahoko.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Huh...surprized to see you talk
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's me, Daigen , Satetsu...i don't know the other threes names.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: When is the tournament gonna be?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Higane, of the Hyuuga family.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) pointed at the boy behind Satetsu and then motioned to the Pearl eyed kid and lastly the boy beside him</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Nice to meet you and I&#39;m sure it will be easy to remember your name cousin!&#34;</font> He yelled out a bit, looking towards his cousin&#39;s head.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) arrives on the scene of the streets, where it seemed students were eager to start some kind of something. As an elder of the village, it wouldn’t go unnoticed.

<font color = white>&#34;And what have we here?&#34;</font> He asks in a very skeptical tone, brow raised behind the darkness of the hood and mask</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Alright ima go hand in the scroll then.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (test
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the mask man stopping mid step with a scroll in his hand.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh...Hello.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) wafts his hand about his nose, not much liking the smell of cabbage. Thankfully the smell didn’t really stick.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello young....student. What is all of this commotion....&#34;</font> he trails off, looking at the gathered many before continuing. But as if it were a new statement. <font color = white>&#34;About.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uzumaki, Nakagawa (The short red-headed boy-Godlike2909) glanced toward the commanding man, giving him a once over before he lowered down onto the ground, taking a seat.

<font color = white>&#34;Some kind of tournament is happening or something&#34;</font> He said as he raised and lowered his shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked flinched a bit as the commanding man waved his hand, and they felt self-conscious about their smell for a moment.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh, We are organizing a tournament amongst us students.
Miss Botan is going to oversee it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) Walks up to the group after hearing about a tournament and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh the kids are working on a little tourny, isnt that just fun.&#34;</font>

He continued to watch them to see how it woud progress.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) itches his chin for a moment, before loooking between the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Botan also going to be providing a reward?&#34;</font> He looks over to the Jonin, who would know this wasn’t a spectator from within the village. But one sent by the Shogun for the youth</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...i wonder if i can get wooden shurikens
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) spots the figure and offers a head nod. If he was luck it would be enough to lure him over to his side of the crowd. Should the jounin warp to his position a few words would be exchanged as they whispered to one another. Maintain a sense of privacy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) folds his arms while side-eyeing the jonin next to him. They reeked of something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) walks off to the side, half listening to what's going on behind him, while also just observing the body of water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shook their head.
<font color = white>&#34;They didn&#39;t offer one, so we were just going to try to pull whatever resources we had for the top three.&#34;</font>
They looked at the ground for a minute as so many high-ranking people appeared out of nowhere.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) kept herself still in the distance, their eyes seem to perk over towards the crowd with curiosity, the scroll carrier in the distance particularly catching up their attention, eyes press gently in a squeeze, only to widden again. They've managed to catch up the youngling's attention for the time being itseems.

A ceaseless, unblinking stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) noticing the boy nod to him he quickly walked around the group and made his way clumsily towards him. Not cool or interesting in the least. No teleporting or cool moves used. just akward <font color = white>&#34;excuse me, pardon me, sliding by&#34;</font> words as he made his way through the crowd. He would stop by the boy and smile. <font color = white>&#34;Need something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says:  We have nine people so if everyone pitched in it should be a nice little reward...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would pass the scroll to the commanding man showing them all the names</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I don't have any ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I am a jonin a rank above Chunin its nice to see so many new faces around here feels like this year is going to be an interesting one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) had paid close attention to the jounin as he drew closer to the cluster of children from the north. His posture, demeanor and tone seemed far too mature to be a chuunin. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Kryu&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You tell me..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Earlier people called themselfs bitch
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) squints her eyes from afar, nothing escapes the young girls vision.. Let alone a big celebrity like Shion.

<font color = white>&#34;Holy crap! It&#39;s Master Shion! He&#39;s like famous you know!?&#34;</font> She shouted over the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And their mother being a hoe
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Oh...another of the famous ones?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) reads through the scroll swiftly, with something tucked between the parchment now

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I can watch then 500 ryo goes to the victor, 250 to the runner-up&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) asks: A tournament? Now?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) He would present himself with a respecful standing expression and look at the young boy. <font color = white>&#34;You can call me-&#34;</font> He would hear the girl blurt out and he would stop looking respectful and start trying  to hide himself in his kimono.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Shion Aikawa nice to meet you.&#34;</font> He would say quickly trying to make his presense evaporate without success.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case...if they are given wooden weapons can i get wooden throwable ones.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) Looked to Higange Hyuuga as they shouted over the crowd for a moment before the commanding man spoke.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh...Of course, you can watch!&#34;</font> They yelled in excitement as it seemed they now had a prize.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: I'm Higane! Of the Hyuuga family, my brother is a big fan of yours!
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) yells: Miss Botan!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: Pathetic.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) ran up to the Chuunin with a scroll in his hands.
<font color = white>&#34;We did.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (Someone drop me a single ryo pls rq u will get it back)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) takes a deep breath and sighs.

<font color = white>&#34;Is he now. I am honoured. Uhm Higane was it. Could you lower your voice a little.&#34;</font>

He looked around hoping people would continue what they were doing. He gave her a polite yet akward smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Ah, you located a listing?
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I unfortunatly did not bring any weapons with me on my walk around the village.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) took a moment to obtain said scroll before she moved to unroll it, and thus begin to examine it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Nicely done and in a quick fashion,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It took a lot of work but we have Nine People for the Tournament.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It seems to make it even, we need one more.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) takes a deep breath as he floats back from his meditation, trying to pay full attention to what's going on around him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Unless one wishes to have two matches.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) had totally forgetten all formalities after seeing such a famous individual roaming the streets. <font color = white>&#34;And a.. oop!&#34;</font> She blurped out covering her mouth instinctively.

A deep, slow and controlled bow was returned towards the much older man. <font color = white>&#34;I apologize..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I got a question
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: We even got someone to offer up some prize money.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Can we get practice weapons for this tournament?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm? If you require weapons? I would advise they be made, till we are able to hand them out.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: 500 ryo for the winner and 250 ryo for the runner up.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Ah, good work.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I need throwable ones.
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Rocks.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Use the wooden practice sets, thats my plan at least.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: One must learn to turn everything into a weapon.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) they turned around to point to the commanding man who was offering the money but they were gone</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ..i need wooden shurikens.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: oh...he left

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Sogeki entered the arena, the atmosphere seemed to bend slightly to accommodate his presence. His stride was purposeful, each step echoing with a quiet confidence that demanded attention. The onlookers, a mix of curious students and seasoned shinobi, instinctively parted to make way for him, sensing the aura of determination and power that surrounded him.

His cloak billowed behind him, adding to his imposing figure, and his icy gaze swept across the arena, taking in every detail with a keen awareness. The sinister smirk on his face played at the corners of his lips, a subtle promise of impending action and calculated moves.

With a deliberate motion, Sogeki cracked his knuckles one by one, the sound echoing faintly in the silence. It was a gesture of readiness, a physical manifestation of the energy coursing through him. His eyes narrowed slightly, focusing on the challengers gathered in the arena, each one a potential obstacle to overcome.

A low murmur of anticipation rippled through the crowd as they sensed the imminent clash of wills. Some regarded him with apprehension, others with curiosity, but all acknowledged his presence with a mixture of respect and wariness.

Without a word, Sogeki positioned himself at the center of the arena, his stance firm and balanced. He exuded an aura of dominance and readiness, a silent challenge to anyone bold enough to face him. The smirk on his face widened imperceptibly as he awaited the beginning of the tournament, eager to prove his strength and assert his place at the top.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki methodically paces towards Higane, the air thickens with oppressive tension. His every step echoes with quiet menace, each footfall calculated and deliberate. The onlookers, usually boisterous and lively, fall into an uneasy silence as they witness the unfolding scene.

Sogeki's demeanor is chillingly calm, his eyes narrowed into icy slits that seem to pierce through the very soul of anyone who dares to meet his gaze. His presence exudes an aura of impending danger, like a predator stalking its prey with unwavering focus.

The sound of his footsteps reverberates ominously in the arena, setting off a cascade of nervous whispers among the spectators. Some shift uncomfortably, their instincts screaming at them to flee from the palpable threat emanating from Sogeki.

Higane, standing firm in the face of this approaching storm, can feel the weight of Sogeki's gaze bearing down on him like a heavy yoke. A cold sweat breaks out on his brow as he realizes the magnitude of the challenge before him.

With each passing moment, Sogeki closes the distance with a deliberate slowness that only heightens the tension in the air. His movements are fluid yet controlled, like a coiled serpent ready to strike at any moment.

Finally, he stands mere paces away from Higane. Sogeki's lips curl into a menacing smirk, devoid of warmth, a harbinger of impending turmoil and ruthless determination.

The arena falls into an eerie silence, anticipation hanging thick in the air like a suffocating fog. All eyes are fixed on Sogeki and Higane, two forces on a collision course destined to unleash chaos and turmoil upon the arena floor.</font></font></font>

He pivots smoothly, evading Higane&#39;s makeshift senbon with a sidestep that seems almost effortless. The wooden needles whistle past him harmlessly, grazing the air where he had stood just moments before.

A dark glint flashes in Sogeki&#39;s eyes as he retrieves a pair of wooden kunai from his own kit with a fluid motion. His expression remains stoic, but a simmering intensity radiates from him, an unsettling aura that seems to pulse with anticipation.

He takes a deliberate step forward, closing the distance between them with a predator&#39;s grace. The arena around them seems to hold its breath, the tension thickening with each passing second.

Sogeki moves decisively, launching one of the wooden kunai towards Higane. It cuts through the air with precision, a silent declaration of his intent and skill. The blade&#39;s trajectory is aimed to test her reflexes, a challenge laid down in the quiet confrontation unfolding between them.

<i>Woosh!</i> The kunai whistles past her long black hair as she ducks bellow it, entering a low stance and releasing a new set of senbon at her oponent with a swift step backwards. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. three left.&#34;</font> She mumbled as her fingers fidget with her shinobi kit.

Her determination and adaptability are evident as she enters a low stance, preparing her next move with a swift step backwards. He senses her calculating gaze and the tension in the air thickens as she readies her next set of senbon.

Moving with controlled aggression, Sogeki closes the distance between them with deliberate steps. He weaves and sidesteps, evading the incoming senbon with fluid movements that speak of honed skill and instinct. Each step he takes is purposeful, a silent dance of anticipation and readiness.

His focus remains locked on Higane, studying her movements and adjusting his strategy accordingly. Sogeki doesn&#39;t rush into action just yet, opting instead to observe and assess his opponent&#39;s tactics. His expression is unreadable, a mask of calm amidst the flurry of movement and tension surrounding them.

As Higane mutters to herself about her remaining senbon, Sogeki&#39;s smirk returns briefly, a silent acknowledgment of the challenge she presents. He knows this won&#39;t be an easy match, but that only fuels his determination to prove his strength and skill in the unfolding confrontation.

Her strategy of shoot and evade challenges him to adapt and respond with equal precision. The senbon fly towards him, propelled by her practiced technique, but Sogeki remains calm amidst the storm of needles.

He smirks faintly at her taunt, a glint of amusement dancing in his eyes. His steps are measured and deliberate as he continues to close the distance between them. Evading the projectiles with deft movements, he waits patiently, timing his response with calculated precision.

As the last senbon whizzes past him, Sogeki seizes the moment. With a sudden burst of speed and agility, he launches himself towards Higane. His movements are swift and decisive, closing the gap between them in a heartbeat. His hands blur as he prepares to strike, ready to test her defenses and assert his dominance in the arena.

Small beads of sweat form behind the girls nape.. <font color = white>&#34;Ah shit, last two huh..&#34;</font> She whimpered as she launched her second to last set of senbon at Sogeki.

His tactical adjustment had cost him footing, and in that moment of vulnerability, he saw Higane&#39;s senbon closing in.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn,&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath, his eyes narrowing with determination. Swiftly drawing one of his remaining sets of senbon from his own kit, he thrust them forward in a calculated clash of wood against wood, intercepting Higane&#39;s projectiles with precision.

The clash echoed through the arena, the sound of wood meeting wood reverberating in the tense silence. Sogeki held his ground, his movements deliberate and controlled as he advanced slowly. His focus intensified, a silent determination radiating from him despite the setback.

With each measured step forward, Sogeki recalibrated his strategy. He needed to close the distance effectively, relying on his remaining weaponry and his own skills to turn the tide in his favor. His eyes locked on Higane, calculating his next move as he prepared to engage with renewed resolve.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As the senbon flew towards him, Sogeki&#39;s focus intensified. Despite his efforts to intercept them, one of the needles found its mark, grazing his arm and embedding itself deeply. He winced at the sharp sting, but his resolve remained unbroken.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah!&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted through clenched teeth, feeling the sting of the senbon piercing his flesh. He quickly pulled it out with a swift motion, blood trickling down his arm. Ignoring the pain, he maintained his steady advance towards Higane.

His gaze locked onto her, his expression hardening with determination. The injury fueled his fighting spirit rather than weakening it. With a determined grunt, Sogeki pushed through the discomfort, his movements fluid and focused.

Closing the gap with unwavering resolve, he pressed forward despite the injury, ready to meet Higane&#39;s next move head-on. His mind raced with strategies, adapting to the evolving dynamics of their confrontation. Sogeki knew that every moment counted now, and he was determined to prove his strength and resilience in the face of adversity.

Let&#39;s do it!&#34;</font> She shouted as the wooden needle flew across the makeshift arena.

The moment the needle is released, Higane gets low to the ground, widening her stance into a peculiar one.. Her right leg trails behind her as her left knee bends ahead her arms extend out in opposite directons.

<font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font> She shoute with vigor.

Was this a bluff?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s relentless advance halts abruptly as he sees Higane&#39;s final set of senbon hurtling towards him. His eyes narrow with determination as he prepares to intercept or evade the incoming projectiles. However, just before he can react, Higane&#39;s voice rings out with unexpected intensity, shouting <font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font>

Confusion flickers across Sogeki&#39;s face for a moment. He doesn&#39;t recognize the term or understand its significance, but he senses the conviction in Higane&#39;s voice. Ignoring the unfamiliarity, he refocuses on the immediate threat of the senbon heading his way.

With a swift sidestep and a flick of his wrist, Sogeki manages to deflect some of the senbon, but one grazes his shoulder, drawing a sharp intake of breath from him. He winces at the pain but doesn&#39;t falter. His mind races, recalibrating his approach as he continues his determined advance towards Higane.

His strategy remains unchanged: assert dominance, prove his strength, and seize control of the confrontation. The unfamiliar technique Higane mentioned is momentarily set aside in his mind as he readies himself for the next exchange, focused on the immediate challenge before him.

He places hands within his pockets before smirking. He watches his two clansmen spar looking at the form of their Jyuuken as he had yet to really train with the clans Taijutsu style.

'Might as well get a good idea of the foot work...', he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s smile slowly creeps up her face as she snickers outloud.. <font color = white>&#34;Whats wrong?! Not closing in anymore! You&#39;re in range!&#34;</font>

The young girl holds her stance, and remains still. Her resolve steadfast. It could have all ended here.. But Sogeki&#39;s attitude begun to irritate her.. slowly wilting away her patience. <font color = white>&#34;You talk so high and mighty, but you don&#39;t understand what its like to be revered! What it&#39;s truly like to be thought of as an elite...&#34;</font> She stopped herself halfway..

Her teeth audibly grit making a low grinding sound. <font color = white>&#34;The pressure... the damn pressure..&#34;</font> She concluded, as her stance seemed to waiver and almost crumble.. no longer did she look as agile and intimidating.
