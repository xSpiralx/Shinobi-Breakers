<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) nods-- mostly to herself.

     <font color = white>&#34;You made it sound like people don&#39;t really want to talk to you. That and you talk kind of..&#34;</font>

Her free hand idly moves as she searches for the word.

<font color = white>&#34;Proper?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: I don't know... Didn't Najiro just run your pockets?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: he accepted a dice game,so did i
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Don't worry about another Shinobis pockets.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both parties agree to it.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: But i stay with Ryo just so you know.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stretches his hand back and forth, massaging out the pain. <font color = white>&#34;Couldn&#39;t be me... That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (lol the irony of the amount of bullying Asa's taken mixed witht he fact he's currently shoeless
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Aren't you the one being thrown at a lake,got a wegie by a construction worker,and got your hand broken by trying to hit the croutch of said guy
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Did you see that guy?  He was a unit...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If im you? i might watch my words from now on
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I had a lapse in judgment. Won't happen again.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I was the one thrown in the lake.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: But it seems yall are fine over here so im heading to the cafe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) pursed his lips, looking at Najiro through slitted eyes. <font color = white>&#34;Naji, I&#39;m the biggest hater. I won&#39;t lower my tone because that guy was bricked up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) waves to the group before turning to depart</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) waved as the cabbage reeking individual left.

     <font color = white>&#34;Take care.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Hana and simply say

<font color = white>&#34;More of most people sleep,and i read alot.But anyway,i won&#39;t ask anymore questions,if thats what you want.&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (to react?
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Oh. I need to warn that guy about the shoe eating sharks.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He blames a fellow student for his missing shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Eh? We eat shoes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: News t'me.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Thats his issue.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns towards the voice.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a sha--..&#34;</font>

She trails off, the obvious note of his features coming into play.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh. Right.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Meh, I'm jus' here to make money, 'nd serve my nation, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Sounds simple enough to me!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Right?! Simple as all things should be, mhm-mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah,yeah...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Just don't act without a single thought inside your heads.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Eh? What would make you think I'd do that..?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I plan to live a fulfilled life - I can't be acting reckless.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: Is that the kind of energy I have..?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: No,but few people do
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm questioning that about myself, as well..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Especally the guy about eating shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: With how he acted today...im fully convinced he will just get into trouble always
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: As for you Hana,haven't seen enough of you to make a clear desicion on what type of person are you.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Well that's just..
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Hmm.. It kind of means a lot to judge the way someone's life is going to go after one day.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im weeks with the guy.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He begin their negativity against me after i  gave up in a sparring match
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: You.. gave up? How come?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It was a tournament set up by fellow students,hosted by one of the jounins.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I gave up cause the fight was simply dragging too damn much
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If one didn't pursuit the other they quickly regain their breath and continue to fight.Due to us being students this becomes too easy..so a strategic fight cannot really happen
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) folds her arms across her chest. Her head tilts as she follows the boy&#39;s words. Eventually, she--

     <font color = white>&#34;You say a lot of words..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Indeed!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Learn t'condense 'em!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: To put it in a simple manner,he hates how i didn't continued the fight and pursuit untill one of us loses.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And sees my actions as being a coward.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Blah blah blah blah blah.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Put simply, screw what other people say - jus' do you, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: The Shark has a point.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Jinbeisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you think i don't know this? Im not bothered by their words,im simply dissapointed by their behavior
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will call you Jinby.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) walked up to the still-gathered group and overheard the end of the conversation. He frowned, his brow furrowing. <font color = white>&#34;You have a bad opinion of me for wanting you to do better? Hm...&#34;</font> Asa shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets. <font color = white>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Jinbei or Jinby, I don't care which!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I like Jinby better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, raising a finger as she blurts out--

     <font color = white>&#34;Beisame!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Beisame.. Sure.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Kfhfhfh... Beisame has a ring to it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its the fact how you acted.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And what you faced as consequences today.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I am who I am.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Do you take me to be ashamed of what happened today? Embarrasses, maybe, Not ashamed. Every defeat is a lesson.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (embarrassed*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) I thought Jinby was pretty good...
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his chin. Repeating the name to himself multiple times. A multitude of names he would need to grow attached too.
     <font color = white>&#34;Jus&#39; call me whatever y&#39;like - so long as it&#39;s respectful - and I&#39;ll respond to it!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: So far 'Beisame' is in th'lead.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, you've got to include the 'same' part or thats just ignoring your family.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: hm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mhm, mhm. The 'Same' part is the most important bit.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Right! Exactly like I prefer 'Beisame', actually takes that factor into equation.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: And...why that part is so nessecary?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Wh-..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I think Jinby is the best.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (Shizuma is hoshigaki too ya know XD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, her brow narrowing at the boy&#39;s question. Her hand gestures towards Beisame-- mostly pointing towards the various visible shark features on his face.

     <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t tell?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (that hoshigaki from boruto
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Listen. Calling a Hoshigaki a name without 'same' is like calling a Senju a name without 'rama' , it's a bad omen.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: It'll ruin your karma.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will look at them both and say
<font color = white>&#34;Zama is also a name in their clan.Surprized nobody knows this&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: 'Rama is more relevant, though.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) nods, sagely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It's just the 'ama' part, isn't it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) nods in turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (*zuma
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Ame and Ama.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Im still going to call him, Jinby. Got it, sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sharky feels like a slur, almost.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It isn't?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm no rubber-ducky nor fuzzy plaything.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,what do you want to be your nickname
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I feel like they get a pass on account of the fact they're like... Small...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I'd be pretty upset if someone called me 'Sharky'.. Kind of down plays the whole family.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If it was anyone else it'd feel racially charged, but in this instance it feels like childlike innocence.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Oh shut your yapping, blondie.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmm, you may be right, cous'.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Sharky doesn't mind me calling him, Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: okay..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Now it's gettin' weird.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Do your, Sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: *you
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I don't feel th'need to repeat myself.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: i will go for a quick run across the village.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not talking to you, Jinby.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm talking to Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..just this group here.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: What does your clan have to do with knowing your name?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Or nickname rather? Nicknames are fun!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: What is this even about.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Nicknames for Hoshigaki.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I gave Jinby a nickname and someone said something about it being Ra-sh-a-ly charged.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I dont think they like me calling Sharky, Sharky....
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: But Sharky doesn't mind.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Uh-huh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....Anyway.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Well if they don't like it why not respect their wishes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I care less for it anymore.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: Who tells a little girl her nicknames are racist?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: thats a boy
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..Is it?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: It?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yuki clan have very feminine males.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) steps forward. Her hand comes to her chin as she glances over them.

    <font color = white>&#34;I.. can&#39;t really tell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: If it means anything.....I don't know any of you people names either.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Same, t'be fair.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Najiro. You need glasses my little shinobi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) loses their childlike innocense and glares at the profound blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Who are you calling it, you hag!?&#34;</font>, they exclaim, their face puffing and arms crossing across their small body.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: That's a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Both of them are sisters i think
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: How dare you misgender me cabbage breathe!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (OMIT)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) pointed at the two Yuki's</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....thats definatly a boy
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Oh with the exception of cabage breath over there.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (inserts 2024 lesson on gender pronouns into naruto game)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both are boys infact.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello Bill.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And My name is Najiro,Rose.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Hello, Perfume lady.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) gave Bill the senju nod of approval.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Little Girl tell Najiro to get his eyes checked.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Mind carrying my bags?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Little girl?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;H-Hag?&#34;</font>

The insult causes a visible recoil from the girl. Her entire aura shrinks as she recalls the second conversation she had with this group. There was no way she--

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not old! We&#39;re probably all the same age!&#34;</font> she shouts in protest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do it yourself
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm simply Jinbeisame, or as th'lady beside me called me, 'Beisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: They are not heavy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) points up at the older profound blonde. Their small frame still slightly dwarfed by the older child.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m 10. Your at least like...Like...16! You&#39;re ancient for a shinobi!&#34;</font>, he exclaims.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: And i'm Hannah Montana.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says:  Hey...can you tell him that you are a boy
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Everyone belives you are a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) asks: Hannah's a Boy?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Who is even Hannah?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Points at that Cold child</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm a boy..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) walked forward and stood beside the two students.
<font color = white>&#34;Aye, Hana, you are too old to get into it here with this kid, especially on the new bridge.&#34;</font>
He tucked away his touch and placed a hand on top of the cold child&#39;s head.
<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be talking like that to people older than you, kid.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he would make his way over to stand next to the Cold child. Before looking towards the others. <font color = white>&#34;I can tell, But that might also be because...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hana,in their defense
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You do look...mature.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not a hag but...that early puberty hit you hard.

<font color = white>&#34;You mind your business too grandpa.&#34;</font>, he said, before turning his attention to the others who seemed to be debating over his gender.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t even look like a girl. I&#39;m clearly a boy!&#34;</font>, he says.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) glanced.. down? Wow. The kid really was shorter than her. Both of her fists came to her hips, her expression quickly shifting to showcase her brief stint of anger.

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only <i>thirteen</i>, smooth-bits! Don&#39;t get mad at me because you&#39;re stuck between a boy and a girl!&#34;</font>

She leans forward, an almost-visible spark of tension between the two shinobi. That was, well, until the cabbage-reeker stepped between them.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Didn't wanted both parties to fight one another</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would move to stand next to his cousin. To be fair he himself looked far girlier than the other. But he wore traditional masculine clothes. That&#39;s probably what made him not be mistaken for a girl so often. He looks towards the other. <font color = white>&#34;Things could be far worse.&#34;</font>  He remarks with a little laugh, <font color = white>&#34;The real question is does our clan have any Girls, or will all the Hyuuga be too scared to check.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) squinted their eyes at the cold child, a thick vein appearing on their forehead at the kid&#39;s words.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only 13, you brat!&#34;</font>
Their hand shot into their pouch as they quickly lost their temper, not knowing why they tried to be the voice of reason when they had such a short fuse.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Bill...

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Cause the little brat is supposed to show their elders respect.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: don't you both got any toys to play with already kiddos.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: It probably doesn't have any! Their parents call tell if they should get them dolls or Action-Ninjas!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) brow twitched as the kid started making faces at them, and the veins on their forehead grew larger.
<font color = white>&#34;Oi, Brat, you may be a kid, but you&#39;re still an academy student like me, so show some respect.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Im not above back handing a brat
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: To be honest, we should settle this with a game of 200, I'll hold the funds, too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) stops making faces and glares at Bill. The child-like jokes and aura instantly dissipating into an icy chill. His eyes would lock onto the cabbage haired elder child.

<font color = white>&#34;If you touch me, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</font>, he says, in a cold monotonous tone. His child-like immature visage being replaced with something much colder...Much more...sinister.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his hands together.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you do fight whoever...try to not overdo it and break your limbs.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) locked eyes with the cold child as their aura shifted around them, and they felt a slight chill wash over them as they saw a rather severe look in the child&#39;s eyes.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, ya.&#34;</font>
They moved their hand forward, disregarding the sudden shift in the air as he touched the cold child&#39;s forehead and flicked them with a finger.
<font color = white>&#34;Then make me.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) stands still, the air around them seemingly thickening at the intensity radiating from this child. He would watch keenly, the boys hand seemingly moving in slow motion. However, he would not even need to react as the girl with the enchanted aura grabbed the cabbage boys hand.

<font color = white>&#34;You even move like an old man. You couldn&#39;t hit me with a strike that slow if you tried&#34;</font>, he said coldly, still having not moved an inch from where he stood.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (you know they can dodge it right XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Rose(The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) OOCs: (Dont dodge it
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With one more insult, she probably would have done what the cabbage-perfumed boy was doing.

For both of their sake, it was a good thing that he went before she could. Now, she just remained back to watch that scene unfold.

<font color = white>&#34;Knock it out, cabbage kid!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) assume his stance slowly, with his foot evenly spaced out. His dominate left would shift forward as he waited for the match to begin. Both arms were raised out from his pocket as if to guard any strikes. Each fist was tightly clentched, concealing the items sorted within. Immediately responding to the projectile thrown in his direction, The red-headed child executed a juke and spin at the last minute. 

Finding some confidence in his talent, the child sprinted forward with the intent of closing the distance. Responding in a similar manner, his right hand open to reveal tooth picks. Wedging one between his index finger and middle, the flick of the wrist would send the wooden tool towards Najiro's callus feet.

He suppose the wooden senbon he&#39;d dodge earlier did manage to connect but not enough to inflict and injure. 

<font color = white>&#34;Aw mehn, Imma have to get this sewn up again&#34;</font> he muttered underneath his breath. Returning his focus back on Najiro, the sprinting child reloaded his hand again with another toothpick. Like done before he&#39;d weaving out of the projectile&#39;s line of fire in a sporatic manner, dodging the incoming tool once more. 

With only a flick of the wrist, another toothpick makeshift senbon was sent through the air, targeting the callus feet once more.

Closing his distance once more he&#39;d evade the projectile by spinning around and allowing the gord on his back deflect the wooden projectile. Pressed to make every action count, the boy flung another toothpick at his target&#39;s callus feet - this time he&#39;d hope to strike true.

(Hit with petty damage due to being a senbon,Hitting with D agility Senbon again.  3/8 senbons remaining)</font></font></font>

Taking a defensive stance soon after his foot was grounded.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: I guess I'll wait my turn... but I could definately use some senbons.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Don't be silly boy.. why are you trying to talk to a donkey? Donut might be smart, but he can't speak..

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: An estimate works.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes a moment to really experience the music. As she was of foreign origin, her music style was different than anything that had influenced him locally.
  It was peaceful, a meditation, and thought-provoking. There was a certain free essence to it.

   Yurei thought that it was beautiful, and so he stared at the young woman a bit slack-jawed.

  <font color = white>&#34;If you want me as a doll, I could help.&#34;</font> The Mugen said, blushing at her talents!</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: How much for senbon kind sir?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) hopes that the kid didn't mean any other deranged form of partner.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) pumps a fist into the air.
  <font color = white>&#34;A&#39;right.&#34;</font> He smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I will have prices for weapons and more by the time you all become shinobi.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Will we have permits to travel to these lands?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Also can you save and order for me? One Kunai and 10 senbons?

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afro,i will check whats going on over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) needed a moment to realize she suddenly got a bunch of money from her new friend. <font color = white>&#34;Wait are you sure about this?!&#34;</font> then quickly she had to turn around to talk to the blacksmith, she was very overwhelmed by all of these things going on. <font color = white>&#34;O-okay then! I &#39;unno exactly when I&#39;ll pay you back but I&#39;ll come back and pay full price!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) ignored the manner as to which the merchant was flamboyant, and offer a smile. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Junji of the Ogura family.

With that he wanders off to find his brother.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...buying their horse will be very wrong.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shakes his head. <font color = white>&#34;This old man hasn&#39;t brought anything beside..&#34;</font> he rummages through his pockets <font color = white>&#34;..two sticks worth of joints.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Yes'suh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) chuckles, stepping back and munching on his bag of Burritos</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So yer' a merchant that doesn't have anything to sell?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) tucks the flute into her back pocket in exchange for a pair of white dice. 
       <font color = white>&#34;This is a game I learned as a child and I used it to determine who would have leftovers between me and my late brother.&#34;</font>

The tone was upbeat despite the tragic news. 

<font color = white>&#34;The game is simple and the winner will model and recieve the very first edition of my plushie collection for free. I&#39;ll start to sell them afterwards, and that is assuming you make enough of a name for yourself to earn one.&#34;</font>

The dice are thrown into the center for the group to expect. The numbers were digital-and advanced. <font color = white>&#34;The game is called &#39;200&#39;. Everyone will roll the dice using &#39;200&#39;. The number you get will act as your next roll number, and it could range from 199-to-1, it all depends on your luck.&#34;</font>

With a soft laugh, she concludes. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll keep rolling &#39;your&#39; lowest number until you get to &#39;1&#39;. The last person to hit &#39;1&#39; will be the winner. Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Maybe we should be talkin' to that one over there.. I think they said their name was Junji or somethin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shooes away the willful kid as he turns his attention to Ogura <font color = white>&#34;You are correct young man. The supply chain won&#39;t be fixed for a couple of months still.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: inspect*
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'm a girl..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sorry to hear that flute girl..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It's okay, that is a story for another time.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But alright...guess i will play,i already know im gonna lose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her attention back to A&#39;suno, and listened. As she started to describe the game, the smaller, blue-haired, angry-looking girl recognized it as the same game that other children had been playing near the arena. It even had the same name. She wondered if it spread from Akihabara, or if it had just spread to Akihabara. Either way, she was ready to play.

<font color = white>&#34;Prepare to lose, Yurei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah, right
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Hey, mista'
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's hope this one isn't just for show..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the explanation of the game.
 <font color = white>&#34;Sounds like it&#39;s based on a roll of the dice.&#34;</font> Therefore in his mind, if he lost, it was only fate.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got this. Their gonna be sowing Mugen dolls until their fingers bleed. Ehahaha.&#34;</font> He laughed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares at the plump youth for a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t sell armor in your size, yet.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Well this Amekagure executioner guy almost broke my hand. Look!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) holds up his small blue and purple hand which is obviously bruised from nearly being crushed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With that guidance, the girl bursts onto the scene of gathered individuals. She steps forward, her height in stark contrast to the masked individual. The contents of their conversation don&#39;t even register in her mind. Throughout that group, only one youth gains the attention and ire of the blonde&#39;s sunset-colored iris.

     <font color = white>&#34;<b>Runt!</b> We&#39;ve still got a score to settle!&#34;</font>

One hand moves to her own hip. The other extends outward, a dedicated point thrust right towards the cold one&#39;s face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) Took note of the figures words and recorded his title as <b>Amekagure Executioner</b>

Squinting his eyes he&#39;d respond, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be sure to rise up to the occation and claim the position... I to will become a shadow of the village&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: hana...stop this
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid-sentence when he hears a familiar screech. Quickly hiding his hand back in his kimono sleeve. He would look over to the blonde haired hag from the other day.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh no.&#34;</font>, he thought, slowly moving backwards away from the girl, his cold eyes intently locked onto her.

<font color = white>&#34;You stay away from me, ha-....Lady..&#34;</font>, he said coldly. Best not to antagonize one with such monstrous strength.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Should be fine, Naji'.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;No can do!&#34;</font>

Even the mentions and quick brandish of his injured hand don&#39;t phase her or halt her approach. Once more, that invisible spark of tension radiates from her eyes as the two lock their gazes. Her target had already been set.

     <font color = white>&#34;Executive orders, short-stuff. Hand over your shoes!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: What she said. Would rather strong-arm them from you than one of my cousins.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would hear some rather newer voices, one&#39;s he hasn&#39;t even seen or met yet. It had seemed the village was bursting with energy, but...he didnt care for the commotion in which was going on. He didn&#39;t turn his visage towards anyone, in fact, he was focused on one thing and one thing only. The destroyed village that was currently needing to be Reconstructed. So, the masked figure would push his way through the younger generation, giving them no time of day.

He had decided, to be done with conversing for now, especially while there was work to be done. The book and pen, would be placed within his equipment. Before he would finally speak, a low and dark voice would come out of his mask.

<font color = white>&#34;If you wish to fight each other over some trivial matter...then proceed.

But, if you wish to show me your value and worth to the village...then it&#39;s time to put your actions where your mouth is. In but a few moments, I am going to begin Reconstructing our Bridge that was blown up by those damn Dakuteika heathens.

So, either help...or get out of my sight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Who are you to question me, child?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: I'm willing to be an assistant to the restoration of the bridge.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Certainly not a soldier of mine.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The student who is gonna be medic,and has common sense.
<br><font color=green>*Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) says: Hm...seems it's already been done...wish I would've been informed of this. Oh well. Beats a day of work for me to do.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Watch your tone.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's yer direct superior yer get snarky with.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) Their answer was that final straw for the blonde. Her hands moved from their pointing, relaxed positions and instead dropped to her side. Just like the day(s) prior, they slowly began to curl themselves into fists. She took a singular step forward, the wraps around her soles pressing against the concrete.

     <font color = white>&#34;Just don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you an out, runt!&#34;</font>

It takes only a jolt for her to take off into a full fledged sprint. Step after step is made in dangerous approach of the youthful one. With her target locked, there wasn&#39;t exactly anything going to stop her from making her way over to them.

Just how would they respond?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Don't end up like wedgie-boy from yesterday.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I won't.But with how seems on daily basis we have people who do this? im losing hope
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Good soldiers follow orders, man. We're not all peace, love, and sunshines 'ere.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your hope matters nothing to me or my soldiers.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) pulled forth a cloth with his clan's crest printed on it. Use this to summon me.

With the stealthy talents of the mask figure, he could easily places it in the shadows in the uzumaki's line of sight to catch his attention. Summoning him to where ever the cloth placed, serving as a marker.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: They will do as their told and I will see the results of it.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Question me again and you can receive punishment too.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: A punishment for what exactly?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: For a senju not doing anything?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Insubordination, for one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) looks around attempting to find a way out of this situation. What kind of odd request was it to have them remove their shoes. They would not be subject to suggest indignity.

Continuing to move back towards the bridge. They would scan their environment looking for a way to defend themselves from the encroaching assault.

<font color = white>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just go away and leave me alone.&#34;</font>, he said, continuing his retreat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers: /w Is your cousin safe? I was only following orders. Please relat the message
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: If y'don't like what you see, stay quiet and watch.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: He walked by earlier, he seemed fine. Though I will relay your concern.
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers: Thank you, If I recalled we agreed to study suiton based jutsus together and become each other's rivals. I hope we can continue down this path.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) moved his arms under neath his poncho, folding them as he watched on. Going two againstr one seemed as if it would do very little. Thus, opting to let Hana have her fun seemed more probable.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: Who knows, maybe that scuffle y'had may spark that rivalry more.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: I'm betting it shall, at least.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Why shall i stay quiet and watch if i don't like what i see.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Najiro, I'm trying to *help* you, but you don't see it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) One by one, her hands swung with those galavanting strides. Each audible step just gave a warning and reminder of the damage she was capable of inflicting. To step back was to delay the inevitable.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one making this harder on yourself&#34;</font> She calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would turn around, staring at the afro haird child as he seemingly ripped off a piece of cloth with his clan&#39;s crest on it. The masked figure didn&#39;t even move his arm upwards to take the cloth. Instead, he would look straight through the sole of the Uzumaki.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need a piece of cloth to summon you. If I find myself in need, I will take The Commander above a Student. Like I have said before...I am watching you all. Waiting to see which one of you, and only one, interests me the most. I would suggest, focusing on your training for the next year or so.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) starts to sweat as the hag closes the distance between them. He had not properly thought through his retreat. Now she was upon him, his mind was blaring red alarms as the memory of her monstrous strength sent a shiver down his spine.

<font color = white>&#34;I won&#39;t be bullied by some hag!&#34;</font>, he said defiantly, attempting to weave a set of handseals. If successful, two clones of the child would appear in a puff of smoke on each side of him.  Though they would not move, as if all were frozen in place with fear of the impending strikes.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) That gap between them closes in mere moments. She nigh skids before them, her clearly experienced hands already working at her side. Initially, the entire ordeal was something she only did out of demand and fear or reprimandation. A violently, horrific word slams into her ears. It was the same word that caused the situation from last night. It was the same word that powered up those dangerous fists of hers.

And it would be the same word that solidified the amount of damage she&#39;d inflict upon the cold youth.

As his hands come together to formulate those seals, one of her own mixes between the two to slap them out of order. There wouldn&#39;t be a puff of smoke or any clones-- only the fiery wrath of the blonde as she forcibly entered his space. 

     <font color = white>&#34;<i>Sabrosa!</i>&#34;</font>

Her other hand extended downward, a violent push aimed towards the youth&#39;s face to shove him into the ground. Excessive, sure.. but he&#39;d certainly asked for it.

His face would widen with horror, as he braced himself knowing full well what would come next. 

Before he could process the next movement, a hand would grab the top of his head, causing his face to slam into the concrete with a violent force. The blood curdling scream of a child would erupt from him, as the stern concrete mashed the soft bits of his facial flesh with his skull.

He would lay there severly bruised with blood leaking down their small forehead. He would feebly raise his arms to the ground attempting to before passing into unconciousness. Though in the instant before he would curl into a fetal position grasping his shoes with all his strength even in his unconscious state.

There wasn&#39;t an ounce of restraint in it, clear by the lack of worry or response from the blonde as their face bounced on the pavement. She stood above him, her hands still twitching with the anticipation of more. Clearly, their last exchange of blows didn&#39;t teach the cold one anything.

Fortunately, despite this rage, she wasn&#39;t some sort of psychopath.

Those jittering palms made their way to the cold youth&#39;s shoes. That cry and the surrounding blood were, yet again, idly ignored as she took to reaching down towards those shoes. Clutch as much as they&#39;d like, she pulled and pried those two straight from his feet.

With them in tow, she took to holding them both with a singular hand; her index and middle finger capable of hoisting them up. She immediately about faces, her attention already upon the instructor of said punishment.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) sighed. She eased forward slowly, and suddenly rushed to the area of the attack - she noted the injuries, and the outcome but that wasn&#39;t what truly caused her concern. 

She noted blood, blood touching her pavement - ruining her street and it caused her to briefly chuckle. 

   <font color = white>&#34;As stated before, anything done to the village will be applied to you - and I see blood on the street,&#34;</font>

Even in the view of a higher-up, she didn&#39;t truly care and suddenly she moved to curve her hand around and lurch a singular fist towards the stomach of the Student. It wasn&#39;t designed to inflict injuries, just a subtle method to ensure they remember.

    <font color = white>&#34;See that, Beisame? That&#39;s how you--&#34;</font>

Unfortunately, that lock onto familiar faces cost her. Before she could even finish her sentence or identify the attack, a devastating shot rocked the tanned one&#39;s midsection. She immediatly lurched forward, her grip upon the boy&#39;s sandals <i>nearly</i> releasing from that shot of pain.

All of the energy within her body was forcefully knocked out of her. She nigh crumbled just from that singular strike alone-- forced to shaky knees. If the dancer wasn&#39;t holding back, it was certain that the blonde would have been reduced to the same unconcious state that she left the cold youth.

     <font color = white>&#34;W-Wait.. I-I&#39;m..&#34;</font> She tried to speak.. but that fresh damage made it impossible to formulate a sentence. Pained, weakened eyes mixed with her expression to convey a message;

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) To say she was unconcious was an overstatement. She might not have been standing upright but she <i>was</i> sentient of her surroundings. As that hand reached towards her mission objective, her hand instinctively came down towards her torso where she clutched the two sandals.

     <font color = white>&#34;H-Hands.. off..&#34;</font> she called out as she slowly managed to rise to a standing position. Still dazed, she took note of <i>yet another</i> elder who brandished their prowess and power. Unfortunately, the blonde wasn&#39;t in any state to argue. She gave only a slow nod of understanding whilst her free hand nursed the freshly inflicted blow to her core.

     <font color = white>&#34;S-Shouldn&#39;t.. the so-called &#39;medic&#39; be helping this guy out..?&#34;</font> she inquired, her half-wrapped foot gesturing towards the Yuki covered in blood.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would approach the scene as they went closer to the Yuki,first thing was to expect closer the unconcious person and act accordingly to it.He knew clearly they were not dead,but firstly he needed to locate where was their injury.</font></font></font>

He will grab two small bandaids,then place a fabric to the wound and keep it with the two bandaids.After the treatment was done he will simply wait for the unconcious person to awake,afterall he did what he can with his basic knowledge of the human body</font></font></font>

Shaking their head and attempting to get their bearings, they would stare up at Rose whom they assumed had just bandaged their wound.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you...&#34;</font>, they said, staring at the blonde who had attacked him. There would be an ominous look in their eyes something that most in this village would be all too familiar with. Vengeance.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Well, yes.. But I'll just carry a spare-pair for when that time comes!

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: If he told you to beat all of us,would you do it?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) nodded in response. Just as she was asked, she trot over towards the elder shinobi.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You are Tsukiko.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sits rubbing the wound on their head observing the commotion unfurling before him. This child who had healed him had quite the gumption to be backtalking the commander the way he was.

However, he could not help but hope nothing bad befell him. He had healed him when others chose to make a victim of him. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) coughed. Her intuition betrayed her.

     <font color = white>&#34;R-Right. Sorry about that, Commander. That punch, you know? Think it knocked around more than just my lunch.&#34;</font> She followed with a dry chuckle-- a rather poor attempt at playing off the situation.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Tell that boy your name.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Tsukiko. Hana's my family bearing.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You are learning.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I will explain this once.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) shook out of her daze and approached the Commander at his behest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) pulls out a single hand, gesturing towards Tsukiko and her shark-kin companion. <font color = white>&#34;If you can not follow simple orders then you are of no use. What if who you think to be your comrade is actually a mole? A mole only I know of. You would ruin an entire mission and operation. Can you handle that much? From the looks, I can&#39;t tell.&#34;</font>

He peers over to Nahoko.

<font color = white>&#34;Nahoko has good comprehensing skill.&#34;</font> He gestures toward her now. <font color = white>&#34;If I told you to attack Tsukiko right now. What is expected of you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) looked to her left, her gaze surverying those present.
    <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d figure out who Tsukiko is and attack them. Hesitation to follow an order can be the difference between a won and lost battle.&#34;</font> 

   The girl recalled her previous conversation with the Commander where he&#39;d drilled home the same point.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and places their aching head in their hands. They did not like this lesson very much. This Uzumaki Commander was just as vicious as his elders had warned.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yeah, its a world of older people beating on younger people because they know they can.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: One day, the roles will reverse.

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) weakly gets to his feet, his legs wobbling beneath him. His equilabrium was still shaky following the vicious blow to his head. His eyes would lock onto the hag who had assaulted him for a second time, as he approached the commander. 

The small child would radiate an aura of hatred towards the fellow villager. In his mind plans and ruminations of vengeance against her already had begun to take hold.

He would carefully approach the red haired commander, staring up at him with their small stature.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes....Sir..&#34;</font>, he said, begrudgingly knowing that this man&#39;s order was the reason that he had been so viciously assaulted and beaten.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You were targeted and beaten.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: How do you feel?

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your shoes are in their grasp forever. After graduation, you are to take them back.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How am I suppose to do that? She hits like a professional sumo wrestler.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm too small..

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep trying.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Just get bigger.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'll pay her back one day, no longer how long it takes.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep burning in the furnace that is my command until you've become something worthy of being made a blade.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Am I understood?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yes...Sir...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Sumo..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Enough of this weak persona. Shed it thoroughly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pinched at her own waist. She wasn't fat...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) bows respectfully not wanting to be party to another beating. There was something about this elder man that unsettled him. His senses screamed at him to not anger this man, although he had not done or said anything outwardly hostile. It was just a feeling that he could not shake.

Turning to leave, he would glare at the profound blonde. His cold icy anger boiling over as he observed his shoes in her grasp. He would look down at his cold pale feet which were covered in dirt, as he grasped his fists and trembled.

<font color = white>&#34;You will pay...&#34;</font> ,he thought, as he walked around the 2 savages and stood next to Rose.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hah! What&#39;sa matter, can&#39;t afford some <i>shoes?&#34;</font></i> She emphasizes the word by giving the sandles strapped at the blonde&#39;s hip a condescending flick.

   <font color = white>&#34;It hasn&#39;t finished, so many people seemed to vanish,&#34;</font>

She then shifted towards the young Student, her hand easing back to nestle the hilt of a massive blade adorned across her back. An Odachi of gigantic mass, and weight yet she eased back once she realized what was about to occur. 

She had no reason to inflict lasting harm, not now but perhaps later.

   <font color = white>&#34;I forgive you,&#34;</font>

A cold-stir of words, and she moved to extend her hand and SLAM it into her stomach much as she had done someone else earlier today. A brief adjustment in behavior if anything. 

She then moved to ease back towards her spot, and her hand pushed back behind her back to meet the other one.

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's for something else.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Just help a fellow shinobi out.

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I won't give anymore money.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Considering today they didn't called us for work on that bridge.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Anyone want to pair up with me? Kinda want to make some reliable friends that I can depend on...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) <font color = white>&#34;A waste of money, huh...&#34;</font>
The sentiment didn&#39;t sit right with her. Instead of suggesting she nab the shoes off of another, the Hozuki opts to disprove the notion right then and there. Just as she was about to go dig up some sharp gravel for the girl to walk across, her attention was stolen by a blurred movement nearby.

By the time she got her eyes centered on the dancer, their fist had already connected, leaving her to watch in awe as the student, presumably, buckled and fell from the weight behind the strike.
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. Damn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Higane.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) knew that the moment following the slip of her tongue were simply the calm before the storm.
    As the muscular, odachi wielding shinobi approached her Nahoko remained as silent and as still as possible. Perhaps somewhere in the back of her mind she thought that if she didn&#39;t move or make a sound she wouldn&#39;t be the nail that got hammered.

   Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case as the act of the elder shinobi&#39;s fist slamming into her stomache at a speed far exceeding her contention instantly caused her to double over in agony.
       A few dry heaves reverberated through the area as an intense, burning pain spread through the girl&#39;s body in relation to the action.

<font color = white>&#34;T-that...scratched my itch.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) sharp eyes clock the lightning fast punch from afar, yet she failed to see when it was released..

She stared onwards with a blank look in her face. The words of Najiro snapping her out of it. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. huh? What&#39;s up Naji.&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) There&#39;s a familiarity in the dashing that takes place. In the instant that the blow connects with the fellow-blonde&#39;s stomach, her own hand moves to protect her gut.

     <font color = white>&#34;B-Believe me.. She&#39;s not walkin&#39; that off easily..&#34;</font> she comments absently, her palm nursing a freshly mended wound.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh, did I? I took a trip with my parents to pray at a shrine. I was gone a few days.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Noting very important to be honest but...it was something
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: One, I would advise you all avoid loitering on the bridge for now - unless someone is with you.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Aye, aye!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Two, I want you all to find groups or figure out people you wish to work with. This will assist in formation of Squads.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Totally cool..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: Fffffawww-- okay.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: hm...why not?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: We should spread out our medical aid.. I read in one of the books I sto-- I mean, I heard that there's usually only one medic per squad.

They asked, looking at a small scroll in their hand that they had found in the library.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Naji the type to get his squad killed because he stopped to think rather than acting.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: Maybe, blondie. I'm still deciding.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Who follows us blindly?

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll keep up with my studies than Miss Botan.&#34;</font>
They said to the chuunin as their gaze roamed the different faces gathered around this point of the village. Many he knew, but there were also some strangers whose names escaped him, a reminder of the ever-expanding community they were a part of.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: See, Botan, I agree. I prefer using large weapons to club m'opponents, personally.

Such a hold caused a cry to escape from his body. Yelping across the yard in a state of pure panic.

She released the hold on his face, a very <i>light</i> push of his cheek aimed to send him a step or two away.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: Senbon's a fancy word for a toothpick.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A medical tool turned into a lethal weapon.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A proper Shinobi can bypass armor, and inflict massive damage with one.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Woah.. Its him..
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Now, for you Bill. What are the three main tools of a Shinobi? The most basic ones.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) looks down at her hands for a moment.
   <font color = white>&#34;Hm. Maybe this is one of those sayings, like-- <i>anything</i> is lethal in the hands of a shinobi,&#34;</font> she muses aloud. Confident in her findings, she plants her hands on her hips and definitively nods. <font color = white>&#34;Very cool.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Eeeeeasy.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Precisely that, my sharp-toothed gal!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) stood in front of Miss Botan, but their gaze shifted to the crimson-haired veteran and the task they gave them.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, Umm...Kunai, Shuriken and Log.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Log?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Huh.&#34;</font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: log isn't a tool..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: It can be.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Only a little though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) quickly moved to do as she had done before, and produced a singular shiny-metallic item from within her sleeve. This time? It was a Shuriken, a singular Shuriken - it wasn&#39;t much but it was still free.

She handed it over.

   <font color = white>&#34;Continue,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) picked up the shuriken and palced it into their bag thanking the chuunin </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) once more moved to produce an item from her sleeve, and this time it was the last of the fundamental three. A singular, freshly sharpened, and steel-carbon infused Kunai. 

It was basically a fancy knife, and she tossed it over towards the young man. 

   <font color = white>&#34;A Kunai,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned.

The veins, arteries and capilaries around her eyes bulge and slowly move across her face adorning them with jagged lines of raised skin. As her already sharp eagle eyes, awaken to their true state.

<font color = white>&#34;These are called Chakra nodes or Tenketsu.&#34;</font> As she spoke Higane, pointed straight towards Botan, her finger perfectly aimed at the Chunin&#39;s Tenketsu points.

She&#39;d then slowly ponder the question for a few brief moments before offering a respone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d gues in theory, the gates would no longer impede the flow of chakra, allowing for its unrestricted flow..

In this moment of calm amidst chaos, Sogeki's presence is palpable yet understated. His eyes scan the surroundings, taking in every detail with a thoughtful and analytical gaze. It's clear he's not here to dominate or assert himself overtly but rather to understand and strategize. Amidst the charged atmosphere of determination and pride, Sogeki's measured approach stands out, hinting at a deeper calculation and readiness to act when the time is right.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki stands amidst the bustling activity of his peers, a subtle awareness prickling at the edge of his senses. He feels the weight of someone's gaze upon him, a piercing stare trying to draw his attention. Keeping his arms folded across his chest, he remains outwardly composed, his expression unreadable.

His gaze drifts off into the distance, not directly meeting the source of the glare but aware of its presence. The atmosphere around him buzzes with energy, conversations blending into a low hum that he tunes out effortlessly. Sogeki's mind wanders briefly, contemplating the day's events and the tasks ahead.

Then, a movement catches his eye—a flicker of motion on the edge of the training ground. It's an interaction he hasn't seen before, unfolding with intrigue and curiosity. Intrigued, Sogeki's focus shifts, his analytical mind now fully engaged as he observes with a keen interest, temporarily forgetting the lingering sensation of someone's scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Maybe I'm a mixed bag of all of 'em.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You are worthy of becoming my soldier, Bill.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: You should use these skills on girls. It's a free excuse to touch them.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I am Commander, refer to me as nothing but that.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: HUH?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki's gaze sharpened as he recognized the familiar aura—sharp, unyielding, like a blade slicing through the air. It was the stern bastard from a few days ago, the one who dared to challenge him openly. Without shifting his stance, Sogeki turned his attention towards the source of the voice, his eyes fixing on the shark-like boy.

Their eyes locked in a silent duel, each assessing the other with unspoken intensity. Sogeki's stare was icy, piercing, as if daring the other to meet his gaze head-on. He conveyed a silent challenge through his unwavering glare, a message of defiance and readiness to engage if provoked.

Despite the tension, Sogeki remained composed, arms folded across his chest, exuding an air of quiet confidence. He waited, patient yet vigilant, observing how the sharkboy would react under his unwavering scrutiny.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Well, I can use them on friends, also. 'Ere, let me help you out.

<font color = white>&#34;No. I good. Nope.&#34;</font>
Dropping down to the ground and curling up in to a ball. Beginning to roll away.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Okay..im done with it&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will now be hunted.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) began to chase that human ball. There was a job to do.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ...Poor guy.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Higane, help.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: My soldiers will come in swarms. For they are forged in the hive that is my command.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And for your knowledge,i read medical books,but at other times a different sorts of ones aswell
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the veteran,the commander, as they spoke, and he wondered what fate they had just doomed his peer to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stared blankly at Sogeki. He pushed his glasses up, the sunlight glinting off the lenses dramatically. He pointed, positioning his body sideways. <font color = white>&#34;You act like a robot. I&#39;d fight you now but alas...&#34;</font> He tilted is head down sadly, <font color = white>&#34;I am without shoes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was being chased?! This was no good. His rolling wasn&#39;t taking him far.
<font color = white>&#34;New plan.&#34;</font>

He was going to do the most unstoppable means of escape. Springing out of his ball form and then going completely still. Like a...like uhh...-like a STATUE!!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) The squint didn&#39;t leave Sogeki&#39;s face. The embedding threat that stands before him.. it rocks Sogeki&#39;s core. Naturally, he&#39;s shaking in his boots.. But he refuses to dishonor the Satetsu name by back down.

Sogeki stands strong-- and steps forward even stronger.

The aggressive lad accepts his fate.
  <font color = white>&#34;Ready to accept my consequences. I simply allow for at least a two on one opportunity. I wish for my father to recognize my body after this.. Commander.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Satetsu, Sogeki(The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) OOCs: (by backing*)
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: History books,Philosophical ones aswell
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) inched a bit forward.. still confused by what was developing infront of her, before asking. <font color = white>&#34;Help with what...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) approaches Sogeki and settles a large hand on their shoulder, his figure towering them easily. <font color = white>&#34;My soldiers do <i>not</i> yield. But I admire such personality.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The hunt will be retracted. Tell me your name.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (i am possessed
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Sogeki,&#34;</font> he replies, his voice steady despite the nervous tremble in his body. The weight of the veteran&#39;s hand on his shoulder is both comforting and imposing, a reminder of the authority he carries. Sogeki meets the veteran&#39;s gaze with a defiant glare, the flames of determination burning fiercely in his eyes despite the fear that churns within him.

He stands his ground, unwilling to show weakness despite the overwhelming presence of the veteran. Sogeki knows the importance of respect in the shinobi world, especially when facing someone of higher rank. Yet, beneath the surface, his resolve remains unbroken, a testament to his unwavering spirit amidst the intimidating atmosphere.

<font color = white>&#34;..of the Satetsu. But soon everyone will call me the Kraken Slayer.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Are they?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) turns away and eyes Tsukiko.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If my soldier says they will obtain a title then that it is how it will be.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Do you understand?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stared in complete astonishment. Beginning to wonder if this boy named <i>Blast</i> was sent here by some cosmic entity.. Though - sleep or not.. Still or not! 

                         <b><i>HE HAD A JOB TO DO.</b></i>

Manipulating his body in such a dramatic fashion as if he was a <i>snake</i>. His presence looming over behind him. It was time. <b><i>Fifty damned Ryo was at stake!</b></i>
      <i><font color = white>&#34;Pin him down as I~...!&#34;</font></i>

The half-shark would grasp the top of his briefs, wasting no time before hopping over his body soon after. Delivering a <i>vicious</i> <b><i>WEDGIE</b></i>! Certainly giving Asa some flashbacks of his very own from the day prior. Landing over the boy he would stand proud. A grin sprayed over his face.

<b><i>The job.. was done.</b></i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Of course. Though it doesnt have a ring to it like "the Commander".. but it'll be renown.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (im so sorry.)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (the commander did not like that.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (lmao did I miss something
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) shrugged. She wasn&#39;t one to contest her higher-ups.

     <font color = white>&#34;..Yeah. I understand.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: ..!

<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) asks: Wuh?

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Higane...whats going on?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) landed pathetically and continued walking over towards his friend. His face sprayed in horror.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Have you ever tasted war? The feeling of a life being taken when the last breathe is made?
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (who did you wedgie
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Because Krakens, in the book, are invasive creature that do nothing but roam and rule the darkness. Amegakure, being the one true light that I will one day lead, must extinguish any and all darkness.

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Thus.. any enemy to Amegakure, friend of foe, is a Kraken.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) <font color = white>&#34;Thirst to slay?&#34;</font>

Sogeki thinks for a moment, then shrugs. He eases into the comfort of the topic.
  <font color = white>&#34;I do.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;But not without cause. Even if it&#39;s frowned upon by the public.. if it needs to be done. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (so since he wasn't wearing underwear

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) nods. A good, solid answer. One with valuable foundations. A very good seedling in the making. These things are being noted.
That is his S-rank mission afterall.

The study each of them and gift them tasks and an environment that will benefit their growth.

<font color = white>&#34;Fine,&#34;</font> he starts, squeezing the boy&#39;s shoulder, <font color = white>&#34;Kraken Slayer must be earned.&#34;</font>

A punch occurs, far too fast to be seen by anyone around. It plants into Sogeki&#39;s stomach with cratering force.

His hand falls from the boy&#39;s shoulder, leaving them to relish in the impacts recoil.

<font color = white>&#34;Now. Why do I see someone giving wedgies?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) didn&#39;t care anymore. His face, having been pasted full of horror, stayed facing the ground. His tone speaking as if he was already dead.

     <font color = white>&#34;..Money.. For weapons..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) side-eyes the Hoshigaki whom had fallen victim to the bad example set by the laborer the day before. It was without a doubt that the Commaner was going to indeed enact some sort of wrath upon him for comitting such a heinous crime.

    Whilst everyone was looking towards the Hoshigaki Nahoko stole a moment to check up on her hair in the reflection of the monument north o fher.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh god..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: ..I humbly accept my fate..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He's punching people like Miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: its a bad sight to see people doing everything for money
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Hide!!
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You have no choice but to.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Both of you stand before me.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I am one who makes examples.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) 's eyes were glazed over as he witnessed Sogeki get the air knocked out of him. So much abuse, so much pain. Is this what it means to be a shinobi?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) epicly fails at hiding behind Blast.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) trudged forward, as the command was given.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (yahoo jutsu r being added slowly!!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: ( who's ready to learn FTG AND RAIKIRI)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) steps to the side. She gives the half-shark a reassuring pat on the shoulder to help ease the woes he felt; unaware that he was about to get thwarted by the commander himself.
   <font color = white>&#34;I--.. oh,&#34;</font> she says, only to watch him leave on command.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) prayed he <i>at least</i> got the fifty ryo. To pay for his future medical bills or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) yells: PUNISH HIM!!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (LMAO
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Come over here, boy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) points menacingly at his attempted assaulter.

<font color = white>&#34;..ok.&#34;</font>
Then he waddles over at impecable speed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s body jerks forward as the veteran&#39;s fist slams into his stomach with brutal force. The impact sends a shockwave of pain through him, causing him to grit his teeth and stagger backward. His hands instinctively clutch at his abdomen, trying to alleviate the intense ache that spreads from the point of impact.

Despite the pain, Sogeki locks eyes with the crimson-haired veteran, his gaze unwavering. His pride refuses to let him show weakness or back down, even in the face of such a harsh lesson. He takes a deep breath, swallowing his pride along with the pain, and straightens up slowly, though the discomfort is evident on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand,&#34;</font> Sogeki manages to say through clenched teeth, his voice strained but defiant. He exhales sharply, willing himself to remain composed despite the throbbing pain in his gut. His eyes remain fixed on the veteran, a silent acknowledgment of the respect he holds for the commander&#39;s authority.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: One of you will be punished for unorderly conduct.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Higane.

<font color = white>&#34;You are a scared cat,aren&#39;t you&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The other will be punched in the stomach by Sogeki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) Walked quickly over to the scene about to happen. Someone other than him getting abused by their elder? A sight to behold.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) asks: What are the other options?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Drainage of your chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: ..I shall take th'brunt of both punishments, if possible.. I am th'cause.. I'll accept th'just rights..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Silence.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Pick one of the three.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: And here I thought shinobi were supposed to take jobs for money...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) stood there silently.

Then he broke the silence.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m confused. Do we still have to be silent?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) regretably shakes her head. <i>How far we have fallen.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) felt bad that Blast-san was being punished but could only watch from a distance as he couldn't save the boy from his fate.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: That'd be hard y'know. Since we have to verbally choose.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Shh...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: If you had like a piece of paper I could point to pick.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He hasn't noticed I was somewhat involved.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) remained otherwise idle as the Hoshigaki made his way through the gathering of shinobi. The actual act wasn&#39;t her end goal here. Unfortunately...

     <font color = white>&#34;Oh.. That&#39;s..&#34;</font>

When he walked back over, she observed his demeanor and that call he made-- She, too, widened her eyes with shock. Not one ounce of her wanted to imagine what that felt like. 

Before she could offer a hand or deliver his justice..

He was gone.

<i>It seems her point had been made.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) whispers: shh

    His arm sliding out of his sleeve as his upper body laid bare. Turning southbound to face Sogeki. The student granted the privilege of hunting and punching him. This was perfectly fine to him.

The neck of his cracked as he readied himself. His right hand raising itself, motioning in a &#39;<i>come on, then</i>&#39; gesture. Thus he spoke finally.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Hunt me? Fine then, let&#39;s do it. Punch me? Do it..</b>&#34;</font>, his finger pointed in Najiro&#39;s direction, his face grinning widely as he continued.

               Finally, the gaze of the boy turned back to Sogeki, his grin spreading as his body flared up. His blue-scaled hand beated his chest as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;<b>Let&#39;s not hold th&#39;Commander up. Deliver yer blow.</b>&#34;</font>, he spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;..for the Commander,&#34;</font> Sogeki whispers.

The impact of his action is felt heavily in the tense silence that follows, hanging in the air as a testament to the Commander&#39;s authority and the consequences of crossing it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) thought about it. Questions. Questions are important. Questions get answers. Questions like 'How hard is he going to punch Haginini? Is the commander a man or woman? Where are my shoes?'</font></font></font>

        Moving along to the side, letting the next recipient take their turn in receiving the punch from the fellow student, Sogeki.
