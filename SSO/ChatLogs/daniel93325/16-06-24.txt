<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: You are but many Kenjutsu techniques when properly learned can be used with a Kunai.

They looked at the stern boy again for a moment.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) Fought the urge to swing on the stern boy and flashed them a smile.
<font color = white>&#34;Haha, right.&#34;</font>
The forced laughter was a painful reminder of the tension, a stark contrast to the attention they were trying to divert back to Chuunin Botan.
&#39;Ya, im targeting this kid first..&#39;
He thought to himself</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (if possible give it to me though ahelp 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) attempted to clarify, <font color = white>&#34;I was play tag earlier with another student and I think he was overthink it a bit.

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: As my mentor first showed me, so I show you.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (WELP
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) sniffed. His mouth twisted into something of disgust. <font color = white>&#34;My guy... Why do you smell like cabbage?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (I apologize to you all for this, I really do.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill(The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) OOCs: ah the good old beheading threat)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (wait
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (what's being rolled for
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) smirked. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You first,&#34;</font>

A brief blur of speed could be noted, fragmented lines of fabric-color as she seemingly vanished in a singular huff of momentum-fueled movement. She appeared directly in front of Bill.

A word not uttered, and she motioned to push her hand forward so that she could lift him up and off the ground before promptly THROWING him behind her back and into the nearby water. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (>:D who gets bullied first.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Maybe that will help clear the smell...
<br><font color=green>*Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) yells: !
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (kiddin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) felt a blush creep up their face at the sudden closeness of the chuunin, and they froze as they watched them reach out for him.
<font color = white>&#34;Um Miss Bota-&#34;</font>
Whatever they had planned to say died in their throat as they felt the wind pick up, and they realized Botan had just launched them through the air.
<font color = white>&#34;Aghh!&#34;</font>
a scream escaped their lips before they crashed head-first into the waiting water, sinking down.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: All of you join him, Suimen is a technique that requires some mannerism of control of Chakra flow.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: You form the Tiger Seal, focus, and even the flow of Chakra towards yer feet to counter-balance the water's movement.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Normally its harder to do this on water then a solid object due to the shifting currents but do not fret.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I have all day to watch you all try, fail, and eventually figure it out.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Don't drown.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: ...what if we don't have the nessecary control?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (it's E
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: You'll figure it out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff5050>Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) nods towards the Chuunin, a bit perplexed at the actions of the female chuunin. the brown haired boy would take a deep breath walking forward towards the water. 

<font color = white>&#34;...&#34;</font>

He felt deep down that he was still incapable of learning how to walk on water.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll give it a shot.&#34;</font>

the boy says sarcastically</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) resurfaced and spat the water out of their lungs as they gasped for air and caught Botan's basic explanation.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would go towards the water while wondering if was good idea to do it at all</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Don't drown huh...crazy chuunin...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) itched at the back of his neck as he watched Bill fly through the air towards the water, wincing as he hits the surface with a resounding splash. With a shrug, he stepped forwards towards the water, sending a glance back towards Najiro.
<font color = white>&#34;Then ye&#39;ll sink! Kahahah!&#34;</font>

With that resounding laugh, he threw up the Tiger seal as instructed. Unfortunately, instinct took over. Rather than attempting to step down onto the water&#39;s surface, his shark-like genetics drove him to instead toss himself into the water head-first, his body moving before his brain could stop the motions, and with a splash, he found himself in the water with Bill, remaining submerged as the orange-haired youth dragged himself up to the surface.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Massive Bull(The restored one-Kristuria) OOCs: (Is the hub working?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (it is I believe.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Afro(The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) OOCs: (waht we got to do for training?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (Hm?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (oh just have fun, I just told you all to get in the water and try.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would walk right towards the water. With a light step over the edge he steps onto the water. His traditional kimono flowing barely an inch off the surface of the waves. Yes, he was being a show off. He would look on over towards the teacher, then the other's struggling with the technique.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff5050>Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) squats down towards the water scanning the students. 

I wonder which one of these idiots is going to go in first the boy says to himself.

there's no way any of these guys can walk on water.. says in a low ton.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) says: Wow.....
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It seems the Yuki has control over their Chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: As expected.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) eventually resurfaced, letting out a gasp of air and a sharp cackle as his head floated out from the surface of the water. 
<font color = white>&#34;Man... I couldn&#39;t resist just diving in... This time I&#39;ll really try, for real.&#34;</font>

He pulled himself up from the water back to dry land, shaking off his clothing for a moment before throwing the tiger seal up once more, and this time hopping back down towards the water. He remained on the surface for a few moments, before slowly, surely sinking down as if he were standing on custard, rather than a solid surface. 

As he sunk, he gazed towards the Chuunin and shook his head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirked. <font color = white>&#34;Step aside, nimrods!&#34;</font> He said as he confidently scrolled to the side of the edge. Confident as always, he formed the necessary seal and channeled chakra to the soles of his feet. As a last effort to establish his superiority, he looked back at his colleagues. <font color = white>&#34;Watch and learn!&#34;</font> he said before jumping directly to the water.

As he hit the water, his feet slid right out from under him and he went face first into the water. <font color = white>&#34;Gyahh!&#34;</font> he exclaimed as he splashed dramatically. During all this nonsense, both of his shoes slipped off and went sailing above his head. One of them landing on the ground and one in the water, next to Bill. 

As Asa surfaced, his face was noticably red. <font color = white>&#34;Hmph...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) can be seen carrying a bunch of shopping bags.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s going on?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: One must be willing to fail before they can learn.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A lesson on Suimen.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (strolled*
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (Hm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff5050>Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) looks below into the water staring at his reflection taking a deep gulp.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahh... &#34;</font>

places his left foot on the surface of the water, as he stares at the Yuki.

His right foot gives out tumbling into the water..

<font color = white>&#34;Oh fu......k&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) felt themselves slowly rise in the water as their chakra pushed them up, and with a moment of concentration, they would spread the same amount of chakra to their hands as they pulled themself to the surface and stood atop the water with shaky legs.
<font color = white>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m about to fall right back in...&#34;</font>
They said, struggling to keep their balance atop the water&#39;s surface.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (KIRIN!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (it was I, the Ninja in the Dancer Outfit that was secretly Pein.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eyes narrow down on the chuunin as he begun the first lesson of the day. Taking notes on the instructions given, Afro marched over towards the edge of the water and replicated the same handseals for practice. Once content with his flow, he moved to a second attempt. This time, with a bit more confidence, he'd leap up over the rails with one hand and begin his descent, the sound of his shirt flapping in the wind would come to a stop once as both feet came crashing on the water's surface, generating a strong ripple. 

Just below his feet a school of fish can be seen scattering away from the academy students. Clearly they were disturbing the natural habitate of the area with this assignment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: While you are all down there, why not catch me a fish each. I'll show you how to properly start a campfire next.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) found himself stepping up onto the surface of the water as if he were walking up a staircase, each time he found himself on steady footing he began to sink down as if he were treading upon quicksand - However, with each step up, he remained upon the surface for an extended period. One second. Two. Five. Ten. Thirty. Sixty.

He was acclimating to the surface of the water, the feel of the current, and the feel of the Chakra as it padded the soles of his feet. After a whole minute and a half, he heard the Chuunin&#39;s words, and a shark-like grin spread upon his face.

<font color = white>&#34;Now that&#39;s something I&#39;m GOOD at.&#34;</font>

And in no time at all, he disappeared under the water&#39;s surface once more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (yo, bill
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Well Atleast I Don't think Saigosame can drown...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) had watched carefully as the dark-skinned dancer walked across the surface of the water showing off a high level of chakra control. After that, he saw many of his peers managing to follow suit and walk upon the surface of the water themselves. Tenjin then stepped forth.

He lept up into the air while weaving a handseal and focusing his chakra into his feet allowing it to be like an adhesive that made him stick to the surface of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm... &#34;</font> he hummed to himself as he noticed that he was standing on the surface but with too much instability. He needed to get to a point where the ebbing and flowing of the water was not constantly threatening to make him fall over.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) shook his head. Why would they be tasked to do such a thing after disrupting there ecosystem with commotion.

Attempting to maintain his balance, the student would begin walking, slowly advancing up the stream to create some distance between him and his peers. Spot some movement under the bridge, the boy would adjust his stance with his back hunched over as he hands over just inches over the whats surface before attempting to snatch his pray

Their gaze shifted to the stern boy as they went face-first into the water, and their gaze followed the boy&#39;s shoes as they flew off their feet.

They will do it without any major issues due to traning somewhat their chakra control,whoever it did drained them somewhat of their chakra to do anything besides walking,if they runned,or even worse attacked,they will simply fall into the water.

Though he wanted to see if perhaps he can increase the timer his chakra did,so he will stay,and check for himself.

Lurking under the murky surface like a predator, he found himself stalking the undercurrents for the fish that the Chuunin had requested.

He was no stranger to the canals of Amegakure, and he was no stranger to the sea life that called the waters around the village home. Plus, he had the natural advantage compared to his peers. While the surface was their domain, the waters belonged to the Hoshigaki, and in time, they surrendered to his will.

He finally re-emerged, holding a writhing, squirming eel in his left hand, and in the right, a fair-sized Yellowtail, of which he dropped down in front of the Chuunin.

Over and over the boy would continue his attempts. Failing over and over until he manage to capture a big fat and plump fish with broad fins.

   <font color = white>&#34;Here is fine,&#34;</font>

A shift, and suddenly she sent her fist directly into a nearby tree - one that was obviously nearly at the end of its span. A brief creak, and then suddenly it exploded with raw vigor. 

A shower of splintered, and now usable fire-wood was littered around it.

A brief SNAP could be noted. It was plopped down admist the others.
