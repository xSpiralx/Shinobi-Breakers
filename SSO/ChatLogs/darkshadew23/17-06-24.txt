    With the element of suprise, his friend had sprung into action. Catching the shark on the hook, per se. Grabbing the cheeks, though carefully missing his gills. 

Such a hold caused a cry to escape from his body. Yelping across the yard in a state of pure panic.
      <b><i><font color = white>&#34;Owowowowow.. Okay-okay-okay, you win, letgo-letgo-letgo&#34;</font></b></i>, his panic jibber-jabble multiplying as the pinch held on.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Huh.&#34;</font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: log isn't a tool..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) quickly moved to do as she had done before, and produced a singular shiny-metallic item from within her sleeve.

She handed it over.

blinked.

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned.

The Hozuki&#39;s brow furrows as she fervorously counts on her fingers. Just as she&#39;s about to kick the Chuunin&#39;s shin and call her a smelly cheater, she was spared and given a <i>feasible</i> question. She hisses out a sigh of relief before jutting a thumb towards herself.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) places her right hand on her chin and her left hand behind her back, quickly weaving a half seal with the hidden hand.

The veins, arteries and capilaries around her eyes bulge and slowly move across her face adorning them with jagged lines of raised skin. As her already sharp eagle eyes, awaken to their true state.

<font color = white>&#34;These are called Chakra nodes or Tenketsu.&#34;</font> As she spoke Higane, pointed straight towards Botan, her finger perfectly aimed at the Chunin&#39;s Tenketsu points.

<font color = white>&#34;The three most vital.. Hmm.. I&#39;d say the ones near the brain, heart and lungs.. Unless you mean the actual chakra gates, thats a different story!&#34;</font> She&#39;d say in a serious tone, not unlike her usual comments.</font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;That is correct, and for extra credit - what happens when you break these gates and allow Chakra to flow uncontrolled?,&#34;</font>

She had already moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve, but which weapon would she decide upon?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: Break the wha now yo?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) scans the Chunins body, scrutinizing her chakra network with the aid of the Byakugan. <font color = white>&#34;Hm..An interesting theory.. If possible, but that sounds like a fairy tale..  I&#39;ve never read about any of that in the medical books I&#39;ve sto-- I mean, borrowed.&#34;</font>

She&#39;d then slowly ponder the question for a few brief moments before offering a respone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d gues in theory, the gates would no longer impede the flow of chakra, allowing for its unrestricted flow.. So perhaps an increase in power?..&#34;</font> She&#39;d rationalyse the proposed theory.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hmm...Higane i got a question
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you can touch any tenketsu point
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why no hyuuga strikes the heart?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) smirked.

   <font color = white>&#34;That would be quite correct, unrestricted flow would allow someone to unleash the full length of their abilities unhindered,&#34;</font>

That young Hyuuga would see nothing out of the normal, outside the fact that her network was quite a raging wildfire of intensely flowing energy. She held her own secrets - and the network never lied. 

   <font color = white>&#34;In theory,&#34;</font>

A moment and her hand was presented, with -two- Senbon. They were tossed towards her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or any very lethal tenketsu point.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) catches the senbon with ease, tucking them inbetween her fingers as if she&#39;d practice it a thousand times before..

The vessels around her eyes relax as her Byakugan deactivates. <font color = white>&#34;I see.. Huh..&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment, tucking the senbon into her medic pouch.

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I&#39;d known you were gonna ask me about anatomy and stuff I&#39;d volunteer first! Miss Botan..!&#34;</font> She&#39;d jest returning to her playful demeanor as she backs off with a whistle.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: guess you won't answer that then.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Striking such a small point within a high speed close quarters situtation has its issues.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh Najiro, I'm only know of the Jyuuken in practice and theory. You'd have to inquire with Master Matsu about something like that.

His arms are folded, and he watches his classmates with a focused intensity. Unlike his usual assertive demeanor, he chooses silence over action, content to observe the unfolding events with a reserved demeanor.

In this moment of calm amidst chaos, Sogeki's presence is palpable yet understated. His eyes scan the surroundings, taking in every detail with a thoughtful and analytical gaze. It's clear he's not here to dominate or assert himself overtly but rather to understand and strategize. Amidst the charged atmosphere of determination and pride, Sogeki's measured approach stands out, hinting at a deeper calculation and readiness to act when the time is right.</font></font></font>

He blinks, with a little curious tilt from his own head as he watches Sogeki. The puzzled look on his soft features was giving away his uncertainty about the other's seeming attitude. He would look away should the other try to meet his gaze. He wasn't interested in picking a fight with someone who looked like they put rocks in their own shoes for fun.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) hopped toward the crowd, almost skipping. A suspiciously good mood, considering he was wedgied, robbed and thrown into the water recently. His eyes scanned the area and fell upon the pale-eyed rapper. <font color = white>&#34;Oh.&#34;</font> he said in a disappointed tone. He wasn&#39;t sure what he should expect. Hyuugas gonna Hyuuga, after all.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Bounce dat ass.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay, I&#39;ll wait for you to finish up then.&#34;</font>
They said, moving the torch closer to their face, their eyes filled with curiosity. They were trying to familiarize themselves with the feeling of the heat, inhaling and exhaling in a crude attempt to train their Katon affinity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (why meeeeee

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) was no better than the other people who clinged to their wallets. His lazy eye snapping back to look forward, he would emit a small chuckle.

     <font color = white>&#34;Pffttt.. I am wise, do not worryyy~.&#34;</font>, he spoke. His tone oozing a laid-back attitude along with it. However..
    You should be worried.

                                       He is not wise.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki stands amidst the bustling activity of his peers, a subtle awareness prickling at the edge of his senses. He feels the weight of someone's gaze upon him, a piercing stare trying to draw his attention. Keeping his arms folded across his chest, he remains outwardly composed, his expression unreadable.

His gaze drifts off into the distance, not directly meeting the source of the glare but aware of its presence. The atmosphere around him buzzes with energy, conversations blending into a low hum that he tunes out effortlessly. Sogeki's mind wanders briefly, contemplating the day's events and the tasks ahead.

Then, a movement catches his eye—a flicker of motion on the edge of the training ground. It's an interaction he hasn't seen before, unfolding with intrigue and curiosity. Intrigued, Sogeki's focus shifts, his analytical mind now fully engaged as he observes with a keen interest, temporarily forgetting the lingering sensation of someone's scrutiny.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (for some reason, my mouse position doesn't correspond to my hops on this laptop

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would spot the veteran and approach them, handing them a small bag with a pair of shoes inside.
<font color = white>&#34;I am still working on the last item.&#34;</font>
They said, passing it to the veteran.</font></font></font>
