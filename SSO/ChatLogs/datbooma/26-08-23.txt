At first, the Hyuuga seemed very supportive of the pinkette&#39;s endeavours- it was as if she was about to go fetch some for the gal right away. Alas, the optimism immedidately dropped as she&#39;d face away.

This was it, his new gear to rotate with the other three sets he owned for the next couple of months. Money is tight, and he wasn&#39;t holding his breath for that to change anytime soon.

But you know what? It didn&#39;t really seem to bug him. <font color = white>&#34;&lt;Already getting dark, huh?&gt;&#34;</font> he muttered to himself. His stomach rumbled like it was telling him to feed it! Its been four days since he&#39;s last ate anything!

<font color = white>&#34;Chill out, will you?&#34;</font> he half-whispered to his grumbling belly. One idea was hitting the mines, maybe get lucky and find something worth trading. But then again, there&#39;s always the chance he&#39;d bump into someone just as broke as him- But more desperate than him. A sufficient deterrent to keep him away from those mines for the time being.</font></font></font>
