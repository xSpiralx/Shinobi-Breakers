<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) As Daigen made his way through the training grounds, he noticed a small, tranquil body of water nearby. The surface was still, reflecting the cloudy sky and the surrounding trees with mirror-like clarity. Drawn to the calmness of the scene, he walked over and stood at the water&#39;s edge, gazing at his own reflection.

For a moment, he stared into his own eyes, seeing the determination and resolve that had driven him through countless hours of training. The reflection seemed to challenge him, a reminder of the strength he was striving to achieve.

<font color = white>&#34;Time to push myself even further,&#34;</font> he murmured to himself.

Taking a deep breath, Daigen stepped back from the water&#39;s edge and assumed a fighting stance. He began to practice shadow sparring, imagining an opponent in front of him. His movements were precise and fluid, each punch and kick executed with perfect form.

He moved swiftly, his fists slicing through the air as he threw a series of rapid punches. His legs followed with powerful kicks, each one controlled and focused. The reflection in the water provided a silent audience, mirroring his every move.

Daigen shifted his stance, incorporating dodges and counterattacks into his routine. He visualized his imaginary opponent&#39;s moves, reacting with speed and agility. His body moved instinctively, the countless hours of training evident in his fluid motions.

As he sparred, Daigen&#39;s mind focused entirely on his movements. The world around him seemed to fade away, leaving only the sound of his breath and the rhythm of his attacks. He pushed himself harder, his strikes becoming more intense and powerful.

Occasionally, he glanced at his reflection, using it as a guide to correct his form and technique. The still water provided a unique perspective, allowing him to see his own movements from a different angle. He adjusted his stance and strikes, ensuring each one was as effective as possible.

Minutes turned into an hour as Daigen continued his shadow sparring. Sweat began to bead on his forehead, but he paid it no mind, his focus unwavering. He practiced a variety of techniques, from basic punches and kicks to more complex combinations and maneuvers.

Finally, after an intense session, Daigen paused to catch his breath. He stood at the water&#39;s edge once more, his reflection now showing a shinobi who had pushed himself to the limit. The calmness of the scene contrasted sharply with the intensity of his training, creating a sense of balance and harmony.

<font color = white>&#34;One step at a time,&#34;</font> he repeated to himself, feeling a renewed sense of determination.

With a final nod to his reflection, Daigen turned away from the water and began to walk back towards the training grounds. He felt a deep sense of accomplishment, knowing that he had taken another important step on his journey to becoming one of the strongest shinobi Amegakure had ever seen.</font></font></font>

Her casual amusement at his presence and her focus on education sparked a familiar intensity within him, reminiscent of Bakugo&#39;s fiery determination.

<font color = white>&#34;Rose,&#34;</font> Sogeki acknowledged with a nod, his voice edged with a hint of challenge. He clasped her hand firmly, his grip assertive yet controlled. <font color = white>&#34;Education&#39;s important, sure. But so is proving yourself in the field,&#34;</font> he remarked, his tone carrying a confident edge.

He couldn&#39;t help but notice her lingering smile, and the thought that she considered him merely another challenge only fueled his competitive spirit. <font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll see how things unfold,&#34;</font> he thought to himself, a small smirk crossing his lips. Sogeki was determined to surpass her expectations, to demonstrate his strength and skill in ways that would demand respect.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s work together then,&#34;</font> he said aloud, his voice carrying a challenge disguised as cooperation. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure you remember me.&#34;</font> With that, Sogeki released her hand and stood tall, ready to prove himself in whatever challenges lay ahead.

Though their interaction turned out differently than he anticipated, Sogeki still holds himself to a reserved stature. Rose could be a better friend and ally-- prolly more than anything else. Only time will tell.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Might is not the only way 
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Some have great minds too.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: She is. Yet.. in every situation, even the smartest of folk have to rely on physical powers. One can't exist without the other.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) yells: Satetsu. We have five people now!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Without strategy and mind...might is nothing but a foolish tactic
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Without might, the execution and protection of the one planning is null.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Mind without body is just theory.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: but body without mind is just being a animal.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: I'm assuming due to how some of you guys look the winner would just have bragging rights huh?Instead make an entrance fee where you need to give five or ten ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Nothin' is for free.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ...?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Bragging rights and the winning pot is up for grabs.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) coughed, clearing their throat before inhaling deeply.
<font color = white>&#34;Last Call for the Tournament! All who want to join, now your chance!&#34;</font>
They yelled, trying to get the attention of anyone interested.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns around, now understanding what&#39;s going on. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll just spectate.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Maybe I could join...
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I dunno...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Eh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) blinks and looks away,
<font color = white>&#34;Sorry...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: What's the price?
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Are you going to join the tournament? We have a Chuunin who's going to oversee everything.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: May i ask who is that jonin?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) shrugged and went back into her head. She needed to figure out what her aesthetics were going to end up like.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: uhm,i mean chunin
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's Miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh...the crazy one
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: So it's a chance to show them what skills you have and maybe impress a chuunin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) holds in a laugh at Najiro's description of a Chunin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Plus you get to see how you stack up to your peers
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, his mind instantly racing to address Rose&#39;s inquiry with his signature arrogance and pride. This challenge was an opportunity to assert himself and motivate others to step up.

<font color = white>&#34;The way I see it,&#34;</font> Sogeki began, his voice carrying an edge of aggressiveness and determination. <font color = white>&#34;We pool our ryo into a pot. The top three winners of the tournament not only claim their share of the pot but earn the right to brag. But here&#39;s the real deal,&#34;</font> he continued, his smirk widening as his arrogance shone through. <font color = white>&#34;Those top three? They&#39;re not safe. Anyone who didn&#39;t make it can challenge them. It&#39;s about more than winning; it&#39;s about proving you&#39;re the best.&#34;</font>

He paused for a moment, his gaze sweeping over the gathered peers. <font color = white>&#34;This tournament isn&#39;t just a chance to compete. It&#39;s a chance to show who&#39;s at the top and who&#39;s willing to fight to stay there,&#34;</font> he declared boldly, his tone challenging yet encouraging. <font color = white>&#34;So if you&#39;ve got any guts, if you think you&#39;ve got what it takes, step up. Train hard. Because this isn&#39;t just about dominance--it&#39;s about maintaining it.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s words hung in the air, a call to action wrapped in his trademark arrogance and pride. He knew his aggressive approach might rub some the wrong way, but he also understood the necessity of pushing his peers to strive for excellence, both individually and collectively.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Sounds cool.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would nod their head which would give off the notion that she was considering in joining this little game of theirs.In reality Rose had already made up he mind and figured just by watchng the fight would give her a better out look on things compared to joining the action.

<font color = white>&#34;I see it does sound amazing,but i&#39;m going to have to decline.&#34;</font>A smile continued to linger on her face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Don't we all?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: What do you practice with?

<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I'm fine with using my fists though.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Higane, of the Hyuuga family.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) pointed at the boy behind Satetsu and then motioned to the Pearl eyed kid and lastly the boy beside him</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) wafts his hand about his nose, not much liking the smell of cabbage. Thankfully the smell didn’t really stick.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello young....student. What is all of this commotion....&#34;</font> he trails off, looking at the gathered many before continuing. But as if it were a new statement. <font color = white>&#34;About.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uzumaki, Nakagawa (The short red-headed boy-Godlike2909) glanced toward the commanding man, giving him a once over before he lowered down onto the ground, taking a seat.

<font color = white>&#34;Some kind of tournament is happening or something&#34;</font> He said as he raised and lowered his shoulders.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) spots the figure and offers a head nod. If he was luck it would be enough to lure him over to his side of the crowd. Should the jounin warp to his position a few words would be exchanged as they whispered to one another. Maintain a sense of privacy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) folds his arms while side-eyeing the jonin next to him. They reeked of something.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;They didn&#39;t offer one, so we were just going to try to pull whatever resources we had for the top three.&#34;</font>
They looked at the ground for a minute as so many high-ranking people appeared out of nowhere.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) kept herself still in the distance, their eyes seem to perk over towards the crowd with curiosity, the scroll carrier in the distance particularly catching up their attention, eyes press gently in a squeeze, only to widden again. They've managed to catch up the youngling's attention for the time being itseems.

A ceaseless, unblinking stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) noticing the boy nod to him he quickly walked around the group and made his way clumsily towards him. Not cool or interesting in the least. No teleporting or cool moves used. just akward <font color = white>&#34;excuse me, pardon me, sliding by&#34;</font> words as he made his way through the crowd. He would stop by the boy and smile. <font color = white>&#34;Need something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) had paid close attention to the jounin as he drew closer to the cluster of children from the north. His posture, demeanor and tone seemed far too mature to be a chuunin.

<br><font color=green>*Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) asks: A tournament? Now?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) He would present himself with a respecful standing expression and look at the young boy. <font color = white>&#34;You can call me-&#34;</font> He would hear the girl blurt out and he would stop looking respectful and start trying  to hide himself in his kimono.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Shion Aikawa nice to meet you.&#34;</font> He would say quickly trying to make his presense evaporate without success.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case...if they are given wooden weapons can i get wooden throwable ones.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) Looked to Higange Hyuuga as they shouted over the crowd for a moment before the commanding man spoke.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh...Of course, you can watch!&#34;</font> They yelled in excitement as it seemed they now had a prize.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Is he now. I am honoured. Uhm Higane was it. Could you lower your voice a little.&#34;</font>

He looked around hoping people would continue what they were doing. He gave her a polite yet akward smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Ah, you located a listing?
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I unfortunatly did not bring any weapons with me on my walk around the village.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (Because you did that that allowed me to get the upper hand)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (And attack you while my doddge resets)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Sogeki entered the arena, the atmosphere seemed to bend slightly to accommodate his presence. His stride was purposeful, each step echoing with a quiet confidence that demanded attention. The onlookers, a mix of curious students and seasoned shinobi, instinctively parted to make way for him, sensing the aura of determination and power that surrounded him.

His cloak billowed behind him, adding to his imposing figure, and his icy gaze swept across the arena, taking in every detail with a keen awareness. The sinister smirk on his face played at the corners of his lips, a subtle promise of impending action and calculated moves.

With a deliberate motion, Sogeki cracked his knuckles one by one, the sound echoing faintly in the silence. It was a gesture of readiness, a physical manifestation of the energy coursing through him. His eyes narrowed slightly, focusing on the challengers gathered in the arena, each one a potential obstacle to overcome.

A low murmur of anticipation rippled through the crowd as they sensed the imminent clash of wills. Some regarded him with apprehension, others with curiosity, but all acknowledged his presence with a mixture of respect and wariness.

Without a word, Sogeki positioned himself at the center of the arena, his stance firm and balanced. He exuded an aura of dominance and readiness, a silent challenge to anyone bold enough to face him. The smirk on his face widened imperceptibly as he awaited the beginning of the tournament, eager to prove his strength and assert his place at the top.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki methodically paces towards Higane, the air thickens with oppressive tension. His every step echoes with quiet menace, each footfall calculated and deliberate. The onlookers, usually boisterous and lively, fall into an uneasy silence as they witness the unfolding scene.

Sogeki's demeanor is chillingly calm, his eyes narrowed into icy slits that seem to pierce through the very soul of anyone who dares to meet his gaze. His presence exudes an aura of impending danger, like a predator stalking its prey with unwavering focus.

The sound of his footsteps reverberates ominously in the arena, setting off a cascade of nervous whispers among the spectators. Some shift uncomfortably, their instincts screaming at them to flee from the palpable threat emanating from Sogeki.

Higane, standing firm in the face of this approaching storm, can feel the weight of Sogeki's gaze bearing down on him like a heavy yoke. A cold sweat breaks out on his brow as he realizes the magnitude of the challenge before him.

With each passing moment, Sogeki closes the distance with a deliberate slowness that only heightens the tension in the air. His movements are fluid yet controlled, like a coiled serpent ready to strike at any moment.

Finally, he stands mere paces away from Higane. Sogeki's lips curl into a menacing smirk, devoid of warmth, a harbinger of impending turmoil and ruthless determination.

The arena falls into an eerie silence, anticipation hanging thick in the air like a suffocating fog. All eyes are fixed on Sogeki and Higane, two forces on a collision course destined to unleash chaos and turmoil upon the arena floor.</font></font></font>

He pivots smoothly, evading Higane&#39;s makeshift senbon with a sidestep that seems almost effortless. The wooden needles whistle past him harmlessly, grazing the air where he had stood just moments before.

A dark glint flashes in Sogeki&#39;s eyes as he retrieves a pair of wooden kunai from his own kit with a fluid motion. His expression remains stoic, but a simmering intensity radiates from him, an unsettling aura that seems to pulse with anticipation.

He takes a deliberate step forward, closing the distance between them with a predator&#39;s grace. The arena around them seems to hold its breath, the tension thickening with each passing second.

Sogeki moves decisively, launching one of the wooden kunai towards Higane. It cuts through the air with precision, a silent declaration of his intent and skill. The blade&#39;s trajectory is aimed to test her reflexes, a challenge laid down in the quiet confrontation unfolding between them.

<i>Woosh!</i> The kunai whistles past her long black hair as she ducks bellow it, entering a low stance and releasing a new set of senbon at her oponent with a swift step backwards. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. three left.&#34;</font> She mumbled as her fingers fidget with her shinobi kit.

Her determination and adaptability are evident as she enters a low stance, preparing her next move with a swift step backwards. He senses her calculating gaze and the tension in the air thickens as she readies her next set of senbon.

Moving with controlled aggression, Sogeki closes the distance between them with deliberate steps. He weaves and sidesteps, evading the incoming senbon with fluid movements that speak of honed skill and instinct. Each step he takes is purposeful, a silent dance of anticipation and readiness.

His focus remains locked on Higane, studying her movements and adjusting his strategy accordingly. Sogeki doesn&#39;t rush into action just yet, opting instead to observe and assess his opponent&#39;s tactics. His expression is unreadable, a mask of calm amidst the flurry of movement and tension surrounding them.

As Higane mutters to herself about her remaining senbon, Sogeki&#39;s smirk returns briefly, a silent acknowledgment of the challenge she presents. He knows this won&#39;t be an easy match, but that only fuels his determination to prove his strength and skill in the unfolding confrontation.

Her strategy of shoot and evade challenges him to adapt and respond with equal precision. The senbon fly towards him, propelled by her practiced technique, but Sogeki remains calm amidst the storm of needles.

He smirks faintly at her taunt, a glint of amusement dancing in his eyes. His steps are measured and deliberate as he continues to close the distance between them. Evading the projectiles with deft movements, he waits patiently, timing his response with calculated precision.

As the last senbon whizzes past him, Sogeki seizes the moment. With a sudden burst of speed and agility, he launches himself towards Higane. His movements are swift and decisive, closing the gap between them in a heartbeat. His hands blur as he prepares to strike, ready to test her defenses and assert his dominance in the arena.

Small beads of sweat form behind the girls nape.. <font color = white>&#34;Ah shit, last two huh..&#34;</font> She whimpered as she launched her second to last set of senbon at Sogeki.

His tactical adjustment had cost him footing, and in that moment of vulnerability, he saw Higane&#39;s senbon closing in.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn,&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath, his eyes narrowing with determination. Swiftly drawing one of his remaining sets of senbon from his own kit, he thrust them forward in a calculated clash of wood against wood, intercepting Higane&#39;s projectiles with precision.

The clash echoed through the arena, the sound of wood meeting wood reverberating in the tense silence. Sogeki held his ground, his movements deliberate and controlled as he advanced slowly. His focus intensified, a silent determination radiating from him despite the setback.

With each measured step forward, Sogeki recalibrated his strategy. He needed to close the distance effectively, relying on his remaining weaponry and his own skills to turn the tide in his favor. His eyes locked on Higane, calculating his next move as he prepared to engage with renewed resolve.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah!&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted through clenched teeth, feeling the sting of the senbon piercing his flesh. He quickly pulled it out with a swift motion, blood trickling down his arm. Ignoring the pain, he maintained his steady advance towards Higane.

His gaze locked onto her, his expression hardening with determination. The injury fueled his fighting spirit rather than weakening it. With a determined grunt, Sogeki pushed through the discomfort, his movements fluid and focused.

Closing the gap with unwavering resolve, he pressed forward despite the injury, ready to meet Higane&#39;s next move head-on. His mind raced with strategies, adapting to the evolving dynamics of their confrontation. Sogeki knew that every moment counted now, and he was determined to prove his strength and resilience in the face of adversity.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) does the unthinkable! The young kunoichi holds her ground as she flicks the last Senbon set at her opponent. <font color = white>&#34;You tough cookie! I&#39;m here waiting for you.. Let&#39;s do it!&#34;</font> She shouted as the wooden needle flew across the makeshift arena.

The moment the needle is released, Higane gets low to the ground, widening her stance into a peculiar one.. Her right leg trails behind her as her left knee bends ahead her arms extend out in opposite directons.

<font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font> She shoute with vigor.

Was this a bluff?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s relentless advance halts abruptly as he sees Higane&#39;s final set of senbon hurtling towards him. His eyes narrow with determination as he prepares to intercept or evade the incoming projectiles. However, just before he can react, Higane&#39;s voice rings out with unexpected intensity, shouting <font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font>

Confusion flickers across Sogeki&#39;s face for a moment. He doesn&#39;t recognize the term or understand its significance, but he senses the conviction in Higane&#39;s voice. Ignoring the unfamiliarity, he refocuses on the immediate threat of the senbon heading his way.

With a swift sidestep and a flick of his wrist, Sogeki manages to deflect some of the senbon, but one grazes his shoulder, drawing a sharp intake of breath from him. He winces at the pain but doesn&#39;t falter. His mind races, recalibrating his approach as he continues his determined advance towards Higane.

His strategy remains unchanged: assert dominance, prove his strength, and seize control of the confrontation. The unfamiliar technique Higane mentioned is momentarily set aside in his mind as he readies himself for the next exchange, focused on the immediate challenge before him.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) Focuses intently upon who he now found to be family. He places hands within his pockets before smirking. He watches his two clansmen spar looking at the form of their Jyuuken as he had yet to really train with the clans Taijutsu style.

'Might as well get a good idea of the foot work...', he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s smile slowly creeps up her face as she snickers outloud.. <font color = white>&#34;Whats wrong?! Not closing in anymore! You&#39;re in range!&#34;</font>

The young girl holds her stance, and remains still. Her resolve steadfast. It could have all ended here.. But Sogeki&#39;s attitude begun to irritate her.. slowly wilting away her patience. <font color = white>&#34;You talk so high and mighty, but you don&#39;t understand what its like to be revered! What it&#39;s truly like to be thought of as an elite...&#34;</font> She stopped herself halfway..

Her teeth audibly grit making a low grinding sound. <font color = white>&#34;The pressure... the damn pressure..&#34;</font> She concluded, as her stance seemed to waiver and almost crumble.. no longer did she look as agile and intimidating.
