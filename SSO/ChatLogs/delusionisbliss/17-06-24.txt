<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) nods-- mostly to herself.

     <font color = white>&#34;You made it sound like people don&#39;t really want to talk to you. That and you talk kind of..&#34;</font>

Her free hand idly moves as she searches for the word.

<font color = white>&#34;Proper?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: I don't know... Didn't Najiro just run your pockets?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: he accepted a dice game,so did i
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Don't worry about another Shinobis pockets.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both parties agree to it.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: But i stay with Ryo just so you know.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stretches his hand back and forth, massaging out the pain. <font color = white>&#34;Couldn&#39;t be me... That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (lol the irony of the amount of bullying Asa's taken mixed witht he fact he's currently shoeless
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Aren't you the one being thrown at a lake,got a wegie by a construction worker,and got your hand broken by trying to hit the croutch of said guy
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Did you see that guy?  He was a unit...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If im you? i might watch my words from now on
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I had a lapse in judgment. Won't happen again.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I was the one thrown in the lake.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: But it seems yall are fine over here so im heading to the cafe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) pursed his lips, looking at Najiro through slitted eyes. <font color = white>&#34;Naji, I&#39;m the biggest hater. I won&#39;t lower my tone because that guy was bricked up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) waves to the group before turning to depart</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) waved as the cabbage reeking individual left.

     <font color = white>&#34;Take care.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Hana and simply say

<font color = white>&#34;More of most people sleep,and i read alot.But anyway,i won&#39;t ask anymore questions,if thats what you want.&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (to react?
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Oh. I need to warn that guy about the shoe eating sharks.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He blames a fellow student for his missing shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Eh? We eat shoes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: News t'me.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Thats his issue.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns towards the voice.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a sha--..&#34;</font>

She trails off, the obvious note of his features coming into play.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh. Right.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Meh, I'm jus' here to make money, 'nd serve my nation, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Sounds simple enough to me!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Right?! Simple as all things should be, mhm-mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah,yeah...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Just don't act without a single thought inside your heads.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Eh? What would make you think I'd do that..?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I plan to live a fulfilled life - I can't be acting reckless.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: Is that the kind of energy I have..?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: No,but few people do
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm questioning that about myself, as well..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Especally the guy about eating shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: With how he acted today...im fully convinced he will just get into trouble always
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: As for you Hana,haven't seen enough of you to make a clear desicion on what type of person are you.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Well that's just..
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Hmm.. It kind of means a lot to judge the way someone's life is going to go after one day.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im weeks with the guy.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He begin their negativity against me after i  gave up in a sparring match
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: You.. gave up? How come?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It was a tournament set up by fellow students,hosted by one of the jounins.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I gave up cause the fight was simply dragging too damn much
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If one didn't pursuit the other they quickly regain their breath and continue to fight.Due to us being students this becomes too easy..so a strategic fight cannot really happen
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) folds her arms across her chest. Her head tilts as she follows the boy&#39;s words. Eventually, she--

     <font color = white>&#34;You say a lot of words..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Indeed!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Learn t'condense 'em!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: To put it in a simple manner,he hates how i didn't continued the fight and pursuit untill one of us loses.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And sees my actions as being a coward.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Blah blah blah blah blah.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Put simply, screw what other people say - jus' do you, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: The Shark has a point.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Jinbeisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you think i don't know this? Im not bothered by their words,im simply dissapointed by their behavior
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will call you Jinby.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) walked up to the still-gathered group and overheard the end of the conversation. He frowned, his brow furrowing. <font color = white>&#34;You have a bad opinion of me for wanting you to do better? Hm...&#34;</font> Asa shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets. <font color = white>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Jinbei or Jinby, I don't care which!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I like Jinby better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, raising a finger as she blurts out--

     <font color = white>&#34;Beisame!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Beisame.. Sure.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Kfhfhfh... Beisame has a ring to it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its the fact how you acted.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And what you faced as consequences today.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I am who I am.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Do you take me to be ashamed of what happened today? Embarrasses, maybe, Not ashamed. Every defeat is a lesson.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (embarrassed*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) I thought Jinby was pretty good...
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his chin. Repeating the name to himself multiple times. A multitude of names he would need to grow attached too.
     <font color = white>&#34;Jus&#39; call me whatever y&#39;like - so long as it&#39;s respectful - and I&#39;ll respond to it!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: So far 'Beisame' is in th'lead.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, you've got to include the 'same' part or thats just ignoring your family.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: hm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mhm, mhm. The 'Same' part is the most important bit.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Right! Exactly like I prefer 'Beisame', actually takes that factor into equation.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: And...why that part is so nessecary?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Wh-..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I think Jinby is the best.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (Shizuma is hoshigaki too ya know XD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, her brow narrowing at the boy&#39;s question. Her hand gestures towards Beisame-- mostly pointing towards the various visible shark features on his face.

     <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t tell?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (that hoshigaki from boruto
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Listen. Calling a Hoshigaki a name without 'same' is like calling a Senju a name without 'rama' , it's a bad omen.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: It'll ruin your karma.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will look at them both and say
<font color = white>&#34;Zama is also a name in their clan.Surprized nobody knows this&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: 'Rama is more relevant, though.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) nods, sagely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It's just the 'ama' part, isn't it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) nods in turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (*zuma
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Ame and Ama.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Im still going to call him, Jinby. Got it, sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sharky feels like a slur, almost.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It isn't?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm no rubber-ducky nor fuzzy plaything.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,what do you want to be your nickname
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I feel like they get a pass on account of the fact they're like... Small...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I'd be pretty upset if someone called me 'Sharky'.. Kind of down plays the whole family.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If it was anyone else it'd feel racially charged, but in this instance it feels like childlike innocence.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Oh shut your yapping, blondie.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmm, you may be right, cous'.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Sharky doesn't mind me calling him, Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: okay..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Now it's gettin' weird.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Do your, Sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: *you
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I don't feel th'need to repeat myself.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: i will go for a quick run across the village.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not talking to you, Jinby.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm talking to Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Keep up.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: So - my cousin?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: A.K.A., someone from my clan.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) dismissively waved her hand. Oddly enough, the comment didn&#39;t really have the same sting to it.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s just asking for one of them to get mad at you..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..just this group here.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: What does your clan have to do with knowing your name?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Or nickname rather? Nicknames are fun!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: What is this even about.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Nicknames for Hoshigaki.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I gave Jinby a nickname and someone said something about it being Ra-sh-a-ly charged.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I dont think they like me calling Sharky, Sharky....
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: But Sharky doesn't mind.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Uh-huh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....Anyway.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Well if they don't like it why not respect their wishes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I care less for it anymore.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: Who tells a little girl her nicknames are racist?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: thats a boy
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..Is it?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: It?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yuki clan have very feminine males.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) steps forward. Her hand comes to her chin as she glances over them.

    <font color = white>&#34;I.. can&#39;t really tell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: If it means anything.....I don't know any of you people names either.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Same, t'be fair.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Najiro. You need glasses my little shinobi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) loses their childlike innocense and glares at the profound blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Who are you calling it, you hag!?&#34;</font>, they exclaim, their face puffing and arms crossing across their small body.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: That's a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Both of them are sisters i think
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: How dare you misgender me cabbage breathe!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (OMIT)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) pointed at the two Yuki's</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....thats definatly a boy
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Oh with the exception of cabage breath over there.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (inserts 2024 lesson on gender pronouns into naruto game)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both are boys infact.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello Bill.
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Goya, Nahoko has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And My name is Najiro,Rose.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Hello, Perfume lady.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) gave Bill the senju nod of approval.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Little Girl tell Najiro to get his eyes checked.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Mind carrying my bags?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Little girl?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;H-Hag?&#34;</font>

The insult causes a visible recoil from the girl. Her entire aura shrinks as she recalls the second conversation she had with this group. There was no way she--

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not old! We&#39;re probably all the same age!&#34;</font> she shouts in protest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do it yourself
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm simply Jinbeisame, or as th'lady beside me called me, 'Beisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: They are not heavy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) points up at the older profound blonde. Their small frame still slightly dwarfed by the older child.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m 10. Your at least like...Like...16! You&#39;re ancient for a shinobi!&#34;</font>, he exclaims.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: And i'm Hannah Montana.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says:  Hey...can you tell him that you are a boy
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Everyone belives you are a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) asks: Hannah's a Boy?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Who is even Hannah?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Points at that Cold child</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) walked forward and stood beside the two students.
<font color = white>&#34;Aye, Hana, you are too old to get into it here with this kid, especially on the new bridge.&#34;</font>
He tucked away his touch and placed a hand on top of the cold child&#39;s head.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) feels a hand grasp the top of his head. Quickly, he scurries to the side to remove the unrequested touch and stands next to his cousin.

<font color = white>&#34;You mind your business too grandpa.&#34;</font>, he said, before turning his attention to the others who seemed to be debating over his gender.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t even look like a girl. I&#39;m clearly a boy!&#34;</font>, he says.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) glanced.. down? Wow. The kid really was shorter than her. Both of her fists came to her hips, her expression quickly shifting to showcase her brief stint of anger.

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only <i>thirteen</i>, smooth-bits! Don&#39;t get mad at me because you&#39;re stuck between a boy and a girl!&#34;</font>

She leans forward, an almost-visible spark of tension between the two shinobi. That was, well, until the cabbage-reeker stepped between them.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would move to stand next to his cousin. To be fair he himself looked far girlier than the other. But he wore traditional masculine clothes. That&#39;s probably what made him not be mistaken for a girl so often. He looks towards the other. <font color = white>&#34;Things could be far worse.&#34;</font>  He remarks with a little laugh, <font color = white>&#34;The real question is does our clan have any Girls, or will all the Hyuuga be too scared to check.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) squinted their eyes at the cold child, a thick vein appearing on their forehead at the kid&#39;s words.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only 13, you brat!&#34;</font>
Their hand shot into their pouch as they quickly lost their temper, not knowing why they tried to be the voice of reason when they had such a short fuse.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Cause the little brat is supposed to show their elders respect.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: don't you both got any toys to play with already kiddos.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: It probably doesn't have any! Their parents call tell if they should get them dolls or Action-Ninjas!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) brow twitched as the kid started making faces at them, and the veins on their forehead grew larger.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: To be honest, we should settle this with a game of 200, I'll hold the funds, too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) stops making faces and glares at Bill. The child-like jokes and aura instantly dissipating into an icy chill. His eyes would lock onto the cabbage haired elder child.

<font color = white>&#34;If you touch me, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</font>, he says, in a cold monotonous tone. His child-like immature visage being replaced with something much colder...Much more...sinister.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: ....
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his hands together.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) locked eyes with the cold child as their aura shifted around them, and they felt a slight chill wash over them as they saw a rather severe look in the child&#39;s eyes.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, ya.&#34;</font>
They moved their hand forward, disregarding the sudden shift in the air as he touched the cold child&#39;s forehead and flicked them with a finger.
<font color = white>&#34;Then make me.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) stands still, the air around them seemingly thickening at the intensity radiating from this child. He would watch keenly, the boys hand seemingly moving in slow motion. However, he would not even need to react as the girl with the enchanted aura grabbed the cabbage boys hand.

<font color = white>&#34;You even move like an old man. You couldn&#39;t hit me with a strike that slow if you tried&#34;</font>, he said coldly, still having not moved an inch from where he stood.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (you know they can dodge it right XD)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With one more insult, she probably would have done what the cabbage-perfumed boy was doing.

For both of their sake, it was a good thing that he went before she could. Now, she just remained back to watch that scene unfold.

<font color = white>&#34;Knock it out, cabbage kid!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well...see ya later
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shifted their arm slightly, avoiding Rose&#39;s hand as he stared at the cold child. He placed his hands behind his head and sighed.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I think she saved you...At that speed you'd be lucky to hit a tiger-turtle while its sleeping!

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: What is that you both gain from this convo?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) So much for letting things play out on their own.

Another insult tossed in the girl&#39;s direction immediately causes her to kiss her teeth. She rushes forward, the once-dying flame of anger relit within her spirit. It takes only a few strides for her to close the gap between herself and the androgynous youth. In that instant the gap is closed, her right hand curls into a fist.

     <font color = white>&#34;Shut... <b>UP!</b>&#34;</font>

Said fist is brought upward from the fiery blondes side. It rockets forward with accuracy and prowess unexpected of a girl of her stature and demeanor; danger lurking within just mere contact. All of that aggression is channeled into a mighty, organ rattling haymaker to the cold youth&#39;s stomach.

</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid insult when a lightning fast strike barrels toward their stomach. His senses pick up in the shift of the girl before she moves, however his small body is not trained enough for his reflexes to allow him to react. 

In an instant, he feels his stomach collapse in on itself, as a hand is buried into his abdomen. They feel themselves sent reeling backwards, their small hands grasping their stomach, as they fall to their knees.

<font color = white>&#34;Owww! How...How could you?! You evil, hag!&#34;</font>, he coughs and sputters attemping to catch his breathe. He would feebly get to his feet, spreading his legs in a battle stance. His cold intensity quickly returning, as he rushes the girl, his fist clenched as he attempts to punch her in her hag face.

<font color = white>&#34;Take this!&#34;</font>, he yells, as his fist surges towards her face at a speed that would only be impressive to a beginner academy shinobi.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) In that moment where her fist pushes into the cold youth's midsection, there's almost a euphoric feeling for the inflictor of pain. A sense of self-inflicted justice nearly erases that rage in just that one strike-- a proper punishment for an act that <i>surely</i> would lead to change.

It even reflects in her face; a pursed lip relaxes into an almost shit-eating grin.

<i>'Hag'</i>..

A shame that such 'happiness' is cut short by yet <i>another</i> insult upon her, this time paired with a strike at her person. She steps back, the gap in their height providing her an easy advantage to avoid its returned strike. All it takes is a simple lean to avoid that inexperienced strike.

The one that responds is nothing of the sort.

As fist fades past her face, her body drops down to <i>its</i> height. Her other hand curls up now and, yes again, poises to send yet another thunderous blow to his gut.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) grunts as he exerts his full force behind his strike, yet his fist is met with the cold emotionless embrace of empty space. This girl...She was no ordinary academy student, yet the young Yuki's pride would not let him give up as he quickl began formulating his next plan.

That would be in vain though, as in the same instant as his fist missed her face, he would be met by the thunderous impact of another fist to his midsection. The sickening sound of crunching bones, shattering ribs, and youthful screaming erupting into the air.

His cold eyes would roll to the back of his head, as he crumbled to the ground holding his stomach before lurching over face down. His mind would go blank as he met the cold embrace of oblivion..Or rather unconciousness.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) squints.

<font color = white>&#34;Oooh..Is he okay?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko(The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) OOCs: (mb got food. sec.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) Another devastating shot to its core. Another feeling of relaxation. That scream it releases doesn&#39;t even register in the girl&#39;s head. Her fist relaxes, the palm catching the unconcious student as they fall forward. There comes only the slightest push-- a nudge to cause him to fall backwards rather than onto her.

A sigh of true relief exits her. With that situation handled, she turns back towards Beisame. Her stance relaxes back to its casual, laid back demeanor. There wasn&#39;t exactly a need to be hostile anymore.

     <font color = white>&#34;Can you believe that thing? How crazy!&#34;</font> She suggests, her finger pointing down towards their unconcious state.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) side eyes the profound blonde. It was noted not to mess with her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) let out a small but audible chuckle as he looked at the unconcious Yuki. Then back towards the profound blonde. His shoulders shifting as he shrugged, beginning to speak.
    <font color = white>&#34;My thoughts exact, I&#39;m glad it was settled though. Y&#39;have fun?&#34;</font>, he muttered. 

His gaze unwavering as if he had front-row seats to a boxing match. Even if in reality, this was a <i>squash match</i>, as they do in wrestling federations. Some form of pity was shared for the cold child. However, it was ultimately shrugged off - the <b>did</b> call his cousin <i>&#39;Sharky&#39;</i> after all. 
              Child or not, that shit won&#39;t chill.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Fun..?&#34;</font>

She pauses, her pointing finger instead coming up to her cheek where she lightly taps. There wasn&#39;t any particular word for what she felt doing that. &#39;Fun&#39; almost felt too simple. Anything extra would be doing too much. Unable to come up with a solution, she merely shrugged in response.

    <font color = white>&#34;I feel he may be th&#39;type. Though, y&#39;can&#39;t help it I guess. Jus&#39; hope they don&#39;t try to jump you. Then again - I could join fighting &#39;em at that point.&#34;</font>, he spoke, beginning to chuckle a bit.

Fun via combat was something that didn&#39;t <i>fancy</i> him per se. But there wwas definitely monetary value when it comes to <b>combat</b> and the likes. Something this kid had an eye for.

Even with that threat and notion, she can&#39;t help but try and shrug it off again.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmn, yeah, hopefully. They might carry th'grudge, but I doubt they're dumb enough to try this charade again..
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Can I see your weird backpack?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Probably not with me.. but they'll try their luck with the cabbage kid..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Perhaps, perhaps. Maybe they'll have a better chance? Either way, out of our hands. However, I may call it a night.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Yer name was Hana right?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Hrm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) leans in. She brings her hand to the side of her face whilst her voice drops to a mere hush.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Huh. You going to sleep, cousin?
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean, I've been asleep this whole time, so. I can't blame you.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Did I miss anything?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hey excuse me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice before busting out into a fit of laughter. Whilst it may have been quite a small topic to laugh at - it was quite funny to him before he began to speak to his cousin.
     <font color = white>&#34;Nawl, other than some scuffling and such. Was entertaining for the most part. But now it&#39;s my turn to do that standing-and-sleeping routine. Oh, right.&#34;</font>
    After speaking he turned to lean to whisper back, his voice carrying his previous joyful tune. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I need to make 1000 ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Can someone help?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: A job maybe?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Sensei?

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's like.. Eight or nine construction shifts.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Its not cheap being a shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ..I don't think all of us combined have that kind of cash to throw around.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: What do you need it for? Maybe I can pitch in if its important.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Potentially jutsus and weapons.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: But mainly jutsus probably.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh..yeah, no.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: I was thinking it was something more important! Like medicine or something!

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Anyways what do I call you guys, shark boy was kinda rude, sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm Jinbeisame. Though y'can do like my friend 'ere and call me 'Beisame'.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Saisame.. Gosame..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Juts-- Anyway! If you're ever looking for me, just call out for 'Hana'. I'll answer. That or someone who knows me will.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s eyes seem to scrutinize the two males indiscriminetly. <font color = white>&#34;Sweet, cool names, I&#39;m Higane.&#34;</font> She paused, clicking her lips before continuing.

<font color = white>&#34;Hi-ga-ne&#34;</font> She&#39;d add as her name continues to be mispronounced by many for whatever reason.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hiii-gaaa-neee. Gotcha'.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) scratched at the side of her head. This wasn't supposed to be confusing!</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: What jutsu are you even interested in, Daigen.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: So.. Not Hee-Gaahh--Naay... but Hiii--Gaa--Nee?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm. Well Katon for one along with shurikenjutsu perhaps.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh... maybe I come up with a nickname instead-- Oh sweet, that sounds cool.. You have an affinity for that? I have no elemental affinity according to the chakra papers.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: No one from my clan really does, its weird. Maybe we're aliens.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, I don't think *everything* has a certain affinity for chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Like goats! You think every goat would utilize a different element? That'd be too complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I feel as though it'd be easy to guess my affinity.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Erm.. guess you're right.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Lets see..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Though I plan t'use nothing but weapons and shit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) comes closer to Jinbeisame.. a sharp pair of eyes clock even the most minute of details from his visage.

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: But, well.. There's a problem.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Hmm..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) laxly pointed a finger towards the male&#39;s gills.

     <font color = white>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t breathing Katon mess with your chest? You&#39;d be turnin&#39; yourself into seafood!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) inhaled and exhaled. This was such a worry he did <i>NOT</i> take into place.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: ...!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would look over to the martial artist. Blinking all of the while. <font color = white>&#34;Training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I guess a shinobi's work is never done.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) flexes his muscles, his opened robes displaying his chest and abdomen. The clearly older man with pupil-less eyes seemed to be smiling brightly.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) reeled his head back, placing his palms against his belly, and let out a loud guffaw.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: The only!

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I beat up that puppet so hard!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would hold his chin thinking on it, <font color = white>&#34;I always imagined you&#39;d have the same kind of dark hair of the hyuuga. You must have seen something so terrifying it dyed your hair white.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I actually used to be bed-ridden as a child! You could say I saw myself dying daily! So I must always keep training!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hoooh, interesting, I must say.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Maybe that's why my hair is also white, I might've been sickly
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: We gotta train that sickness out of you!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: I'd say I'm preeetty buff for right now, but I plan to get even stronger!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to be unwrapping his belt from around his middle.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Oh so you think you're buff huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: WELL TRAINING BEGINS NOW!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: N.. not as buff as yo--.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Eh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) launches his belt at the boy. The belt was deceivingly long, reaching all the way from where Matsu stood to where the shark-ish boy was caught off guard.

The belt wrapped around the boy's body and restricted all movement unless he was somehow able to dodge the attack.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oi, oi! Don't- Don't whap my cousin with a belt, just because OUR clan head isn't here doesn't mean tha-
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oh man...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) drops the skill immediately after.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (you can RP the few seconds of the wrap)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Because I am not sealing a genin)
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Oh that seems like a jutsu I might want to look into.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he would see the other launch a spare bolt of cloth from their clothing. Watching the belt wrap around them. He would huh quietly, <font color = white>&#34;That is some quick clothe right there.&#34;</font>&#34; </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) The eyes of the boy flashed open as the cloth came and immediately wrapped around him. The life of this twelve year old breezed through his mind. All. Twelve. Years. By the time he had finished reliving every moment - the cloth  had returned back to its owner, seemingly. 

        Whilst others would be wary or on edge - Jinbeisame was.. surprisngly wholehearted. His arms pumped as he relives on that moment that played on him momentarily. 

     <i><font color = white>&#34;That was soooo~ cool..! I want that technique, man! Though, I doubt I&#39;ll ever try and learn it for now..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) wraps the belt back around himself, nodding all the while. When his robes are once more fully secured around his waste, he folds his arms one over the other and puffs out his muscular chest.

<font color = white>&#34;You should never assume you are not in danger at every possible moment! You should always strive to be the strongest, like me!&#34;</font> He would then look around to the nearby students, hoping to have impressed them.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I am a master at many arts!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Once you all graduate I shall pass on some of my secrets!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: You should see what I can do to people who can use elemental ninjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: What kind of arts interest you all?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I am interested in Elemental ninjitsu, as well as throwing weapons.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Though I am following a clan herritage.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I can demonstrate a shurinkenjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oh, right. I forgot to fill out that form.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Later, I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: A clan huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Which do you come from?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (back mb)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) took a glance back at the soft-featured boy, then at the Hyuuga. Then, back at the boy. And back at the Hyuuga. Once more, at the boy. And then, at the Hyuuga. 

<font color = white>&#34;... Really?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Yes!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink up at him, with a short bow from them. <font color = white>&#34;I am from the Yuki Clan, I believe Saigosame is making a note on my appearance being rather... Typical for my clan.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Man.. Y'got lucky, I could'a for sure broke out of that, maybe..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Though, I do plan on tailoring up some fine things for myself to wear. Maybe something in red? Blue would be very stereotypical.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean- I'm not one to judge, I'm blue. But the hair, the pale, fair skin, the soft jawline and the big, doe-like eyes were a bit of a giveaway.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) was standing there, perfectly still. The next moment, he had appeared infront of the half-shark boy. A trail of kicked up dirt could be spotted the base of the two spots he travelled between.

He looked down from his superior height and gave a sickly sweet smile, <font color = white>&#34;Want to try a harder one?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) answered dead fast.

<font color = white>&#34;N-.&#34;</font>

<b><i>He already closed the damned distance.</b></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) began to lift a finger to cast a sign, but stopped. <font color = white>&#34;Hm... Perhaps you&#39;re not brave enough!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Sup.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) placed his hands along his waist, his chest poking out. Whether it be a sense of bravado, or simply not wanting to look like a coward in front of the crowd, he shook his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Give it y-your best shot, bwahaha..ha..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Going to judge you forever Saigosame.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: there will be a day, when you are a tall gruff shark man.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: and you say outloud, 'I love fish sticks'
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: and I will stare wordlessly at you infront of your genin squadron.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Eh? I mean. I don't know, maybe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) pushed his head back and gaffawed once more. <font color = white>&#34;Attaboy!&#34;</font> He exclaimed, raising only one hand before forcing his chakra to the student before him.

At once, the ground around both of them seemed to be decorated in black markings- connecting the two of them. The boy would feel immense pressure on himself, glueing him to the spot and stopping any limb movement save for his mouth.

(B+ Power)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) simply stopped walking down the bridge as she watched the scene unfold, the girl blinked, deciding to simply shrug upon the sight of the death delievering Matsu was just practicing.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp, he&#39;s dead.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Goya, Nahoko has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Any sense of affirmation was quickly absorbed. Being praised for his courageous spirit - or pute stupidity, you choose - Jinbeisame stood still, and stood proud. Well, it wasn&#39;t like he had <i>much choice</i>.

Given the time to perform their next feat, the half-shark was frozen in place. Completely unmoving. Whilst his mouth retained its former motor functions - leaving him the ability to grunt whilst trying to regain his posture.

<font color = white>&#34;Th&#39;hell.. Is.. This..?! I&#39;m <b><i>frozen</b></i> of all things?! This is so disorientating but so.. coool~..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) released the sealing barrier and then slapped the boy HARD on the back. <font color = white>&#34;You did great! What&#39;s your name kiddo?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (i say hard but str is my dump)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) watches from the side as he watches the sealing jutsu. A little Oooo leaving him. He leans to the side a little as he begins to think on that. Sealing people in place.... freeezing them in place. Perfectly perserved.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stumbled forward, his face shining with a new light before looking up towards the figure. The thumb of the boy jabbing at himself.
            <i><font color = white>&#34;Why, I am Jinbeisame of the Hoshigaki Clan! Though, like my sleeping blonde friend, y&#39;can call me &#39;Beisame!&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Hoshigaki? Wow! I couldn't tell!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) did not seem to be sarcastic.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) nodded proudly.

<font color = white>&#34;Right?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Got t'be the hair, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Or something about the eyes!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Ah! Maybe, maybe!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Anyways! Someone here mentioned shurinkenjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Would you like to see a technique you could realistic learn after graduation, or perhaps something a bit more advanced?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: No takers it seems!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Oooh.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: SHow me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Alright! Mika, would you like realistic or advanced?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) tilts her head, she brings her hand up to her cheek, scratching it gently. <font color = white>&#34;Realistic.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would nod as he leans over thinking on that, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d be fine with seeing both realistic, and advanced....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: Aye why not both?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) removes the upper part of his robes, taking his arms out of the sleeves and letting the cloth fall down below his waste. His body was muscular as one would expect, but around the chest and ribs, several back markings decorated his skin. He pressed his hand against one near his armpit, and a puff of smoke was produced.

When the smoke cleared, he was holding a set of three shurinkens, he flipped them like one would a coin across his knuckles. <font color = white>&#34;Pretty standard run-of-the-mill throwing stars no?&#34;</font> He asked, smiling brightly. <font color = white>&#34;Well see if you can dodge this!&#34;</font>

He winked as he threw the high-speed shurinkens at Mikazuki!

The girl would have time to react before they seemingly missed her and went around her- though she would see the trick coming up if she had superior eyesight. A second of peace later, he pulled back his arm, ensaring the girl in wires.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki(The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) OOCs: (what speed this is coming in?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Uh for sake of roleplay, C+ if no sight, or E if sight)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) blinks, the girl widened her eyes as she witnessed Matsu summon ninja tools out of a seal in his body, she tilted her head a tad bit, the girl saw the Shuriken coming her way, the speed of the projectiles clearly made her surprised. Plaid eyes scan across the objects as she quickly goes inwards, advancing against the thrown weapons, she dashed forth in order to no longer be a standing target, so the trajectory of the projectiles would shift.

Though shrolled forward quickly in an attempt of dodging the weapons. <font color = white>&#34;Ugh!&#34;</font>

She immediately got up after the weapons passed away, though- As she got up and looked past the shuriken going forth in their normal trajectory, she&#39;d feel a strange, tangling wire wrapping about her torso.

Her arms were glued together right after quite immediately and she&#39;d find her arms restricted-

<font color = white>&#34;HEH?! OH WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) watches the other whip a flurry of shurriken out! He would watch as they would pull at the wires. He even didn&#39;t see them initially. An impressed, &#39;Ooooo&#39; leaving the boy as he watches them weave and change trajectories! Wrapping about the girl suddenly. <font color = white>&#34;Very neat!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) released his grip on the wires, releasing the young Hyuuga from the imprisonment. When the wires fell to the ground at her feet, Matsu slowly pulled them along with the shurinken back towards him, coiling it.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s Ayatsuito, really handy when people move around too much for you to hit em.&#34;</font>He then produced a small scroll and placed the weapons in the center. A flash of smoke appeared, and the weapons were now gone- leaving behind only the scroll with a different pattern written on it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Putting them back on my torso is a pain, but I wanted to show off a bit!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I'll have to restock that later!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Ha, certainly showing off.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I'm going to need a lot of senbon the more I think about it..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: They get expensive fast!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I have something planned for you all in a couple months!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I'll get Botan and Shion to help me show you all what a real battle is like!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) puffed his chest out, <font color = white>&#34;I wager I can take on BOTH of them on at the same time!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) spun as the wire was pulled like in a cartoon, on her own axis. She stopped on a perfect straight position as she was forth and glared Matsu like nothing has happened.

<font color = white>&#34;...Ooh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) stretched out, <font color = white>&#34;Well I should go hit the sack! I have an early mission tomorrow! But I will be around and about a bit later in the day!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Huh.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: What now?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Everyone's asleep?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: What do you want?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) asks: Is there anything to want from you, old guy?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your tongue is sharp but your teeth are not. You will be made example.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) folds his arms, appearing rather sheepish once his developmental flaw had been pointed out. The prepubescent sharkling looks down.

<font color = white>&#34;H-hey.. My teeth are still growing. You don&#39;t need to tell everyone else about that..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) takes a few steps closer to the blue-skinned boy. A blur is made before the sound of a thunderous smack occurs.
The boy had been slapped by speeds far greater than they could perceive.

<font color = white>&#34;<i>Silence.</i>&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) feels the sting of a thunderous slap echo across his face. Its sheer speed sends the preteen unconscious before he could process what happened!

All of this, just for greeting his superior... Was this, the feeling of discrimination against the blue-skinned folk?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You are learning.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You do not address me as old guy.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You call me Commander.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: Nngh...
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If you understand then nod.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) opens half an eye lid. It just barely fixes his vision onto the Uzumaki. 
  <i><font color = white>&#34;C-Commander..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) looked upwards from the ground. His head moving as slightly as it could.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Come with me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) takes some time to get up to his two feet. He silently follows behind his superior.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Onisame(The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) OOCs: (am following)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (word)
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Good morning.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: What'cha doin'?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: You asked me a question?
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Oh, I was just askin' what you were doin'.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: How rude of me not to answer.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I was only waiting.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: What'cha waitin' on?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Results.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) slides into a seat near the girl and casts his gaze forward. <font color = white>&#34;Do you understand the importance of results?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) curiously regarded the man. She hadn&#39;t really seen him around much, but he carried an aura of authority. Her head slowly turns to make eye contact with the Uzumaki as she ponders her answer whilst humming softly.

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d reckon there isn&#39;t much point in exerting effort wihout producing results, yeah?&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) nods in agreement. He holds up a single finger. <font color = white>&#34;You are correct. Results are the most important thing to a shinobi.&#34;</font>

He shifts in his seat.

<font color = white>&#34;It is all that will <i>ever</i> matter on the battlefield. That is my first lesson to you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) stopped humming altogether as the elder shinobi spoke. By using context clues and taking a closer look at the man the girl was able to realize his position.
    <font color = white>&#34;I see, is that why there&#39;s that one saying...history is written by the victor?&#34;</font>

   She canted her body slightly to more properly face the Uzumaki; a sign that she was diverting her full attention to this conversaiton.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) offers another simple nod. She is a good listener. A decent seedling. <font color = white>&#34;Most certainly. Tell me your name, seedling.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Nahoko.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Nahoko. You may call me Commander.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Commander...what?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is all.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Okay Commander that is all.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) giggles.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko(The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) OOCs: (The vein appears on his head...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (LOL)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) reveals only a thin grin. Humor is accepted. Disrespect would not be tolerated however. <font color = white>&#34;Yes, yes.&#34;</font> he joins along with a chuckling grunt of his own. <font color = white>&#34;I look to forge iron-born soldiers of this class of students. You will often see them battling one another. Can you give me a guess as to why I&#39;ve ordered such?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) tilted her head from side to side as she weighed his words. 
   <font color = white>&#34;Well with the threat that happened at the bridge i&#39;d assume you want to make sure everyone understands what they&#39;re signing up for...&#34;</font> she pauses, seeing if he&#39;s still listening, <font color = white>&#34;It sounds like there&#39;s some shady stuff happening and the world is coming to a boiling point around us with this hidden orb that abducts and kills kids and what not. The stakes seem to be quite high...&#34;</font>

     Nahoko was idly twirling her hair around her thumb as she looked from place to place, trying to organize her thoughts, <font color = white>&#34;You want to make sure everyone understands authority and will be capable of following orders so that they don&#39;t mess up and become another missing person?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) gifts her yet another nod before rising from his seat. <font color = white>&#34;Your thoughts are good. Some points are correct. It is not to avoid becoming a missing person however. The fighting is, however, to ensure quick-snap action is taken when an order is barked. Some times the enemy could be a comrade.&#34;</font>

He settles both hands behind his back and moves to depart. It is time to check on results.

<font color = white>&#34;Study well, Nahoko. And pay close attention at all times. I enjoyed the talk.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Of course, hope you find the results you were lookin' for.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) All in all, the blonde believed everything to be handled. She had obtained her mission objective; the small one had been punished for their injuries. All was <i>mostly</i> right with her world.

    <font color = white>&#34;See that, Beisame? That&#39;s how you--&#34;</font>

Unfortunately, that lock onto familiar faces cost her. Before she could even finish her sentence or identify the attack, a devastating shot rocked the tanned one&#39;s midsection. She immediatly lurched forward, her grip upon the boy&#39;s sandals <i>nearly</i> releasing from that shot of pain.

All of the energy within her body was forcefully knocked out of her. She nigh crumbled just from that singular strike alone-- forced to shaky knees. If the dancer wasn&#39;t holding back, it was certain that the blonde would have been reduced to the same unconcious state that she left the cold youth.

     <font color = white>&#34;W-Wait.. I-I&#39;m..&#34;</font> She tried to speak.. but that fresh damage made it impossible to formulate a sentence. Pained, weakened eyes mixed with her expression to convey a message;

Regret.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had already shifted, and turned in place - agile grace, and practiced movements could be noted while her hands instantly moved behind her back and furled into a locked grasp. 

She seemed as if nothing had occured. 

   <font color = white>&#34;When you can stand again, please do ensure that blood is cleaned up - and try not to let the Yuki die,&#34;</font>

The soft thuds of bare-feet with trimmed cloth could be noted while she eased back to her original location. She had finished what she needed to finish.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) throughout the use of the convienient diversion made by the higher up, Nahoko approached the profound blonde and looked down at her.
   Slowly, yet surely the girl bent over and grasped at the blonde's sandals. Without making much sound she attempted to yank the smelly things free of her feet before taking off like a bullet in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>

As he noticed the girl with blonde hair grasping the sandals of his good friend. Jinbeisame was not one to sit idly by as his friends were getting messed with. In such, the boy closed the distance from his previous position to the girl with blonde-hairs side.

The blue-scaled hand of the Hoshigaki grasping their wrist with somewhat decent strength. No where near his friends - but enough. With a face as dead-pan as the Uzumaki behind him, he began speaking.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) To say she was unconcious was an overstatement. She might not have been standing upright but she <i>was</i> sentient of her surroundings. As that hand reached towards her mission objective, her hand instinctively came down towards her torso where she clutched the two sandals.

     <font color = white>&#34;H-Hands.. off..&#34;</font> she called out as she slowly managed to rise to a standing position. Still dazed, she took note of <i>yet another</i> elder who brandished their prowess and power. Unfortunately, the blonde wasn&#39;t in any state to argue. She gave only a slow nod of understanding whilst her free hand nursed the freshly inflicted blow to her core.

     <font color = white>&#34;S-Shouldn&#39;t.. the so-called &#39;medic&#39; be helping this guy out..?&#34;</font> she inquired, her half-wrapped foot gesturing towards the Yuki covered in blood.</font></font></font>

He will grab two small bandaids,then place a fabric to the wound and keep it with the two bandaids.After the treatment was done he will simply wait for the unconcious person to awake,afterall he did what he can with his basic knowledge of the human body</font></font></font>

Shaking their head and attempting to get their bearings, they would stare up at Rose whom they assumed had just bandaged their wound.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you...&#34;</font>, they said, staring at the blonde who had attacked him. There would be an ominous look in their eyes something that most in this village would be all too familiar with. Vengeance.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Finally...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko(The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) OOCs: (Back)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) shook out of her daze and approached the Commander at his behest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) pulls out a single hand, gesturing towards Tsukiko and her shark-kin companion. <font color = white>&#34;If you can not follow simple orders then you are of no use. What if who you think to be your comrade is actually a mole? A mole only I know of. You would ruin an entire mission and operation. Can you handle that much? From the looks, I can&#39;t tell.&#34;</font>

He peers over to Nahoko.

<font color = white>&#34;Nahoko has good comprehensing skill.&#34;</font> He gestures toward her now. <font color = white>&#34;If I told you to attack Tsukiko right now. What is expected of you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) looked to her left, her gaze surverying those present.
    <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d figure out who Tsukiko is and attack them. Hesitation to follow an order can be the difference between a won and lost battle.&#34;</font> 

   The girl recalled her previous conversation with the Commander where he&#39;d drilled home the same point.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (feckin fake door.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (the building is a lie)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: ( at least now yk a hiding spot
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (they'll never see me
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (5ft off the ground
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Right....
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Well said.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess i will blindly follow orders then
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) fans the air dismissively. <font color = white>&#34;Yes. Yes, you shall. I will retract the expulsion.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and places their aching head in their hands. They did not like this lesson very much. This Uzumaki Commander was just as vicious as his elders had warned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Glad yer catching on now, Naji'.
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers: I don't think he's catching on at all.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Like I spoke of earlier, this is no world of rainbow and sunshines
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: I'm praying he does. Dumb or not, I'd rather not have a medic expelled from their stupidity.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yeah, its a world of older people beating on younger people because they know they can.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: One day, the roles will reverse.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is entirely untrue.
<br><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) whispers: It was an attempt at sarcasm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...sure..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) points to the ground in front of him. <font color = white>&#34;Come to me.&#34;</font> he says, both eyes locked onto the young Yuki.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: I'm quite dumb at times, my bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) weakly gets to his feet, his legs wobbling beneath him. His equilabrium was still shaky following the vicious blow to his head. His eyes would lock onto the hag who had assaulted him for a second time, as he approached the commander. 

The small child would radiate an aura of hatred towards the fellow villager. In his mind plans and ruminations of vengeance against her already had begun to take hold.

He would carefully approach the red haired commander, staring up at him with their small stature.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes....Sir..&#34;</font>, he said, begrudgingly knowing that this man&#39;s order was the reason that he had been so viciously assaulted and beaten.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You were targeted and beaten.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: How do you feel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Well my head hurts and I want to pay that ha...girl back.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) visibly twitches.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You have potential.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Potential?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your shoes are in their grasp forever. After graduation, you are to take them back.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How am I suppose to do that? She hits like a professional sumo wrestler.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm too small..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Figure it out.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Did he just call her a sumo wrestler...?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Do not become complacent.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep trying.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Just get bigger.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'll pay her back one day, no longer how long it takes.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep burning in the furnace that is my command until you've become something worthy of being made a blade.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Am I understood?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yes...Sir...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Sumo..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Enough of this weak persona. Shed it thoroughly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pinched at her own waist. She wasn't fat...

...was she?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You may leave.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) bows respectfully not wanting to be party to another beating. There was something about this elder man that unsettled him. His senses screamed at him to not anger this man, although he had not done or said anything outwardly hostile. It was just a feeling that he could not shake.

Turning to leave, he would glare at the profound blonde. His cold icy anger boiling over as he observed his shoes in her grasp. He would look down at his cold pale feet which were covered in dirt, as he grasped his fists and trembled.

<font color = white>&#34;You will pay...&#34;</font> ,he thought, as he walked around the 2 savages and stood next to Rose.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (why everyone calls me rose XD
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Weird stuff... Weird stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Tsukiko, you will do everything in your ability to keep those shoes from his grasp.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Another battle between you two will commence upon graduation.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ngl,hopefully admins allow resets of stats.I feel that me being 12 and turning into 13 gonna screw me up XD
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Oyi, what am I mission out now?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (could try GM-H'ing and asking @najiro)
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Right. Though, I have to ask..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (think to suggest that in disc to see if they like the idea XD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) When the Yuki walks past her, Tsukiko only gives him an arched eyebrow. What <i>would</i> convey confusion invites something else. A dare, almost, for them to try their luck once more.

     <font color = white>&#34;When they lose then.. What happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: It will happen again and again until you lose.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I'm off. Cease your battles in my absence.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Aye, aye.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: That.. sounds like it'll be annoying.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yeaaah, very tedious.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....this is so stupid
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: What even happened
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than the higher ups want us to be brainless
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: noting else.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Oh...
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Cool I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Brainless?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: You still don't get it, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think he ever will.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I get we shouldn't question what we do
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But i rather question why shall i kill someone from our village if im not given enough information
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Because it's an order.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think anyone said anything about doin' that.. but you'd just do it because you were told to. Its not that complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: See...thats my issue.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Precisely.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There needs to be a reason
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's what's bein' a Shinobi is about.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: There is a reason.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: They said so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Picture this; Red Commander tells Beisame to kiss you. I don't think he'd want to do it at all.. but an order is an order!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess you will realize it later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If he tries to kiss me i will kick them in the croutch
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Why is it always weird around here?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Kinda confused as to what really happened here
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Eh? I'm not kissing no man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: But that's Big Red
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko(The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) OOCs: (omit o god)
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: But that's Big Red's order! 
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: You'd have to smooch Naji' or deal with the consequences!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Well, if it's a order, nevermind.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: It's just getting weirder...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....i guess you don't got common sense then
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) nods sagely.

     <font color = white>&#34;Yep. I wouldn&#39;t judge you either.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Probably not, I'm jus' a kid who follows orders.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ...Unless you liked it or something. Then, well...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: You'd be one freaky fish, Beisame.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hell no. C'mon.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm no freaky frog.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Why don't kiss them hana
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ..I think your brain broke on that one.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: ..Yeaaah.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Don't think too much on th'subject, Naji'.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You are the people who love to hit eachother on the head,not me.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yaaaaawn. Don't dwell on such things.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't know about 'love'. I only did it because they kept callin' me old.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....Tsuki
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I will be honest 
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: 'Hana'.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The early puberty hit you pretty damn hard.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: So don't be shocked if someone calls you that.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) blinks. She was still quite short and lightweight.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i base what i said on the playby pic btw.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Well I guess everyone is busy. Najiro if you up for another rematch let me know.

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't..
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: A-Anyway. This street is getting pretty lame to look at. Think I'll go lounge around the park or something.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....im pretty sure i saw you being overwhelmingly annoyed.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'll join ya' in a bit. Might take a few laps.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case....i may hangout around you two,if allowed.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I don't care personally. So long as it doesn't pertain to bad-mouthing our superiors or somethin'.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Well.. Beisame's goin' somewhere else for a bit. Stick with the short-stack and make sure he won't pass out,
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I don't badmouth people for no reason.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) offered a two-finger salute to the Hoshigaki.

     <font color = white>&#34;Catch ya&#39; in a bit.&#34;</font>

The others? Just a nod of her head. She was off!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) chuckled a bit at the name of &#39;short-stack&#39; before he shoved his hands into his kimono. Returning the two-finger salute, bellowing back.

<font color = white>&#34;For sure.&#34;</font>

Then, he was off, not paying much mind to the other stragglers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ....Oooh.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: You.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) pays no mind to the &#39;assault&#39; happening to the north. As the boy shows interest, she steps between them and him to lift a finger.
   <font color = white>&#34;Oi! Remember- don&#39;t get involved unless ye&#39; know &#39;em, or you&#39;re gettin&#39; paid.&#34;</font>

With those words of wisdom(?) shared, the delinquent tucks her hands in her pockets and steps out from betweem him and them, to walk down the stairs.
   <font color = white>&#34;But-- I&#39;ve been good. Nothin&#39; changes... What about you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pipes up, the mention of the commander spurring the girl to action. She approaches the duo of off-white haired youth. Attached to her hip are a standard pair of sandals-- ones clearly too small for her to wear.

Her own feet bare nothing more than wraps. <i>Strange</i>

     <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that anymore. I took care of it.&#34;</font> she states to the reserved youth.</font></font></font>

She gives them a quick once-over before cracking a little grin. Turning to face them in earnest, she steps up and drops the tip of her finger down at the blonde&#39;s shoeless, dripless feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Hah! What&#39;sa matter, can&#39;t afford some <i>shoes?&#34;</font></i> She emphasizes the word by giving the sandles strapped at the blonde&#39;s hip a condescending flick.

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A mere slip of the tongue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: . . O-okay. Just makin' sure.

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Kunai, Shuriken and Senbon accordingly - if you use them and get blood on my pavements, streets, and so forth I believe I made my point earlier.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: No swearing.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) squints, her eyes taking note of the unfamiliar face. Her eyes needn&#39;t follow the finger-- the comment is something that the blonde had become accustomed to as of late.

     <font color = white>&#34;They&#39;re just a waste of money. Bunch of wraps&#39;ll get the job done.&#34;</font> She responds. Her own hands move towards the pair clipped to her person. She taps them once and then--

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Sides. These are bein&#39; held on Red Commanders orders.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) awaited her impending doom.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: enough gambling for today.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Yo Najiro, Spot me 20 ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: im collecting them for..something

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I just need 20 ryo. I'll pay you back double later.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: I think the Tournament was canceled?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...i won't buy stuff from the local blacksmiths bill
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Trust me..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) twitched. 

   <font color = white>&#34;It hasn&#39;t finished, so many people seemed to vanish,&#34;</font>

She then shifted towards the young Student, her hand easing back to nestle the hilt of a massive blade adorned across her back. An Odachi of gigantic mass, and weight yet she eased back once she realized what was about to occur. 

She had no reason to inflict lasting harm, not now but perhaps later.

   <font color = white>&#34;I forgive you,&#34;</font>

A cold-stir of words, and she moved to extend her hand and SLAM it into her stomach much as she had done someone else earlier today. A brief adjustment in behavior if anything. 

She then moved to ease back towards her spot, and her hand pushed back behind her back to meet the other one.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) push up off the ground and made his way over towards the hoshigaki.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Oh no they're dead.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (atm blacksmith npcs are broken
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko(The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) OOCs: (As they should be.)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill(The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) OOCs: Ya i noticed that yesterday)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i reported it today
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (yah, I'm trying to set it up with folks and get some items made to hand out.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's for something else.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Just help a fellow shinobi out.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (like headbands n stoof.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I won't give anymore money.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Considering today they didn't called us for work on that bridge.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Anyone want to pair up with me? Kinda want to make some reliable friends that I can depend on...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) <font color = white>&#34;A waste of money, huh...&#34;</font>
The sentiment didn&#39;t sit right with her. Instead of suggesting she nab the shoes off of another, the Hozuki opts to disprove the notion right then and there. Just as she was about to go dig up some sharp gravel for the girl to walk across, her attention was stolen by a blurred movement nearby.

By the time she got her eyes centered on the dancer, their fist had already connected, leaving her to watch in awe as the student, presumably, buckled and fell from the weight behind the strike.
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. Damn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Higane.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) knew that the moment following the slip of her tongue were simply the calm before the storm.
    As the muscular, odachi wielding shinobi approached her Nahoko remained as silent and as still as possible. Perhaps somewhere in the back of her mind she thought that if she didn&#39;t move or make a sound she wouldn&#39;t be the nail that got hammered.

   Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case as the act of the elder shinobi&#39;s fist slamming into her stomache at a speed far exceeding her contention instantly caused her to double over in agony.
       A few dry heaves reverberated through the area as an intense, burning pain spread through the girl&#39;s body in relation to the action.

<font color = white>&#34;T-that...scratched my itch.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) sharp eyes clock the lightning fast punch from afar, yet she failed to see when it was released..

She stared onwards with a blank look in her face. The words of Najiro snapping her out of it. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. huh? What&#39;s up Naji.&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I am glad to be of service.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) There&#39;s a familiarity in the dashing that takes place. In the instant that the blow connects with the fellow-blonde&#39;s stomach, her own hand moves to protect her gut.

     <font color = white>&#34;B-Believe me.. She&#39;s not walkin&#39; that off easily..&#34;</font> she comments absently, her palm nursing a freshly mended wound.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You missed some stuff happening recently
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The reconstruction of the bridge...the village announcement..that...weird commander.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: With that, I have a few small things to say.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh, did I? I took a trip with my parents to pray at a shrine. I was gone a few days.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Noting very important to be honest but...it was something
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: One, I would advise you all avoid loitering on the bridge for now - unless someone is with you.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Aye, aye!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Two, I want you all to find groups or figure out people you wish to work with. This will assist in formation of Squads.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A Squad is a group of people you will protect no matter the cost, this is a second family.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Aye, aye, times two!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: And, I want you all to consider who you wish to have lead that squad amongst the three of you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) lifts a hand.

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Once you become a Jonin? Then a squad is optional.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Totally cool..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: Fffffawww-- okay.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: Hmmmm The red haired dude?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Higane,do you want to work with me?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh? I don't think that would be a good idea.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (kidnap the blonde.

<br><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) whispers: Aye, shark. Wanna work together?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Correct, if you don't have a squad? I'll find you one.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: hm...why not?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: We should spread out our medical aid.. I read in one of the books I sto-- I mean, I heard that there's usually only one medic per squad.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Pfff...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Ahem.. Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I also believe a few of the higher ups may have favorites already.

<font color = white>&#34;Will there be another Tournament anytime soon?&#34;</font>
They asked, looking at a small scroll in their hand that they had found in the library.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I already know their..favorites.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its whoever follows blindly
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Are we still on this, man..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: You get me? Makes no sense for both of us to-- Oh...
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm? Perhaps Bill, once we have taught you all a few techniques.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: That sounds personal.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) asks: Don't those old crones have anything better to do than to lord over us kids?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: -- No offense.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Naji the type to get his squad killed because he stopped to think rather than acting.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: Maybe, blondie. I'm still deciding.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Who follows us blindly?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Naji is the type that will save his allies in battle! He's gonna be a great medic!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: The three I have my eye on are all the opposite.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: That was rude blondie!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Following blindly is different than following orders.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Nahoko,you the type of person to get their squad killed because someone told you to jump over the clifff,no offensve.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Yuck.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Are we in a genjutsu?

That twist of her flesh makes the girl recoil from the shock and pain.

     <font color = white>&#34;Y-Yowch! What the HECK, Beisame?!&#34;</font> She turns, that raised hand dropping down to lightly swat his away.</font></font></font>

They said to the chuunin as their gaze roamed the different faces gathered around this point of the village. Many he knew, but there were also some strangers whose names escaped him, a reminder of the ever-expanding community they were a part of.</font></font></font>

Such a hold caused a cry to escape from his body. Yelping across the yard in a state of pure panic.
      <b><i><font color = white>&#34;Owowowowow.. Okay-okay-okay, you win, letgo-letgo-letgo&#34;</font></b></i>, his panic jibber-jabble multiplying as the pinch held on.</font></font></font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) places her right hand on her chin and her left hand behind her back, quickly weaving a half seal with the hidden hand.

The veins, arteries and capilaries around her eyes bulge and slowly move across her face adorning them with jagged lines of raised skin. As her already sharp eagle eyes, awaken to their true state.

<font color = white>&#34;These are called Chakra nodes or Tenketsu.&#34;</font> As she spoke Higane, pointed straight towards Botan, her finger perfectly aimed at the Chunin&#39;s Tenketsu points.

<font color = white>&#34;The three most vital.. Hmm.. I&#39;d say the ones near the brain, heart and lungs.. Unless you mean the actual chakra gates, thats a different story!&#34;</font> She&#39;d say in a serious tone, not unlike her usual comments.</font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;That is correct, and for extra credit - what happens when you break these gates and allow Chakra to flow uncontrolled?,&#34;</font>

She had already moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve, but which weapon would she decide upon?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: Break the wha now yo?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) scans the Chunins body, scrutinizing her chakra network with the aid of the Byakugan. <font color = white>&#34;Hm..An interesting theory.. If possible, but that sounds like a fairy tale..  I&#39;ve never read about any of that in the medical books I&#39;ve sto-- I mean, borrowed.&#34;</font>

She&#39;d then slowly ponder the question for a few brief moments before offering a respone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d gues in theory, the gates would no longer impede the flow of chakra, allowing for its unrestricted flow.. So perhaps an increase in power?..&#34;</font> She&#39;d rationalyse the proposed theory.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hmm...Higane i got a question
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you can touch any tenketsu point
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why no hyuuga strikes the heart?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) smirked.

   <font color = white>&#34;That would be quite correct, unrestricted flow would allow someone to unleash the full length of their abilities unhindered,&#34;</font>

That young Hyuuga would see nothing out of the normal, outside the fact that her network was quite a raging wildfire of intensely flowing energy. She held her own secrets - and the network never lied. 

   <font color = white>&#34;In theory,&#34;</font>

A moment and her hand was presented, with -two- Senbon. They were tossed towards her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or any very lethal tenketsu point.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) catches the senbon with ease, tucking them inbetween her fingers as if she&#39;d practice it a thousand times before..

The vessels around her eyes relax as her Byakugan deactivates. <font color = white>&#34;I see.. Huh..&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment, tucking the senbon into her medic pouch.

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I&#39;d known you were gonna ask me about anatomy and stuff I&#39;d volunteer first! Miss Botan..!&#34;</font> She&#39;d jest returning to her playful demeanor as she backs off with a whistle.</font></font></font>

His arms are folded, and he watches his classmates with a focused intensity. Unlike his usual assertive demeanor, he chooses silence over action, content to observe the unfolding events with a reserved demeanor.

In this moment of calm amidst chaos, Sogeki's presence is palpable yet understated. His eyes scan the surroundings, taking in every detail with a thoughtful and analytical gaze. It's clear he's not here to dominate or assert himself overtly but rather to understand and strategize. Amidst the charged atmosphere of determination and pride, Sogeki's measured approach stands out, hinting at a deeper calculation and readiness to act when the time is right.</font></font></font>

He blinks, with a little curious tilt from his own head as he watches Sogeki. The puzzled look on his soft features was giving away his uncertainty about the other's seeming attitude. He would look away should the other try to meet his gaze. He wasn't interested in picking a fight with someone who looked like they put rocks in their own shoes for fun.</font></font></font>

They said, moving the torch closer to their face, their eyes filled with curiosity. They were trying to familiarize themselves with the feeling of the heat, inhaling and exhaling in a crude attempt to train their Katon affinity.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki stands amidst the bustling activity of his peers, a subtle awareness prickling at the edge of his senses. He feels the weight of someone's gaze upon him, a piercing stare trying to draw his attention. Keeping his arms folded across his chest, he remains outwardly composed, his expression unreadable.

His gaze drifts off into the distance, not directly meeting the source of the glare but aware of its presence. The atmosphere around him buzzes with energy, conversations blending into a low hum that he tunes out effortlessly. Sogeki's mind wanders briefly, contemplating the day's events and the tasks ahead.

Then, a movement catches his eye—a flicker of motion on the edge of the training ground. It's an interaction he hasn't seen before, unfolding with intrigue and curiosity. Intrigued, Sogeki's focus shifts, his analytical mind now fully engaged as he observes with a keen interest, temporarily forgetting the lingering sensation of someone's scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Jinbeisame's a cool guy! His favorite element was fire I believe.. or was that his cousin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki's gaze sharpened as he recognized the familiar aura—sharp, unyielding, like a blade slicing through the air. It was the stern bastard from a few days ago, the one who dared to challenge him openly. Without shifting his stance, Sogeki turned his attention towards the source of the voice, his eyes fixing on the shark-like boy.

Their eyes locked in a silent duel, each assessing the other with unspoken intensity. Sogeki's stare was icy, piercing, as if daring the other to meet his gaze head-on. He conveyed a silent challenge through his unwavering glare, a message of defiance and readiness to engage if provoked.

Despite the tension, Sogeki remained composed, arms folded across his chest, exuding an air of quiet confidence. He waited, patient yet vigilant, observing how the sharkboy would react under his unwavering scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And for your knowledge,i read medical books,but at other times a different sorts of ones aswell
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the veteran,the commander, as they spoke, and he wondered what fate they had just doomed his peer to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stared blankly at Sogeki. He pushed his glasses up, the sunlight glinting off the lenses dramatically. He pointed, positioning his body sideways. <font color = white>&#34;You act like a robot. I&#39;d fight you now but alas...&#34;</font> He tilted is head down sadly, <font color = white>&#34;I am without shoes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was being chased?! This was no good. His rolling wasn&#39;t taking him far.
<font color = white>&#34;New plan.&#34;</font>

He was going to do the most unstoppable means of escape. Springing out of his ball form and then going completely still. Like a...like uhh...-like a STATUE!!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) The squint didn&#39;t leave Sogeki&#39;s face. The embedding threat that stands before him.. it rocks Sogeki&#39;s core. Naturally, he&#39;s shaking in his boots.. But he refuses to dishonor the Satetsu name by back down.

Sogeki stands strong-- and steps forward even stronger.

The aggressive lad accepts his fate.
  <font color = white>&#34;Ready to accept my consequences. I simply allow for at least a two on one opportunity. I wish for my father to recognize my body after this.. Commander.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Satetsu, Sogeki(The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) OOCs: (by backing*)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) inched a bit forward.. still confused by what was developing infront of her, before asking. <font color = white>&#34;Help with what...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) approaches Sogeki and settles a large hand on their shoulder, his figure towering them easily. <font color = white>&#34;My soldiers do <i>not</i> yield. But I admire such personality.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The hunt will be retracted. Tell me your name.

The weight of the veteran&#39;s hand on his shoulder is both comforting and imposing, a reminder of the authority he carries. Sogeki meets the veteran&#39;s gaze with a defiant glare, the flames of determination burning fiercely in his eyes despite the fear that churns within him.

He stands his ground, unwilling to show weakness despite the overwhelming presence of the veteran. Sogeki knows the importance of respect in the shinobi world, especially when facing someone of higher rank. Yet, beneath the surface, his resolve remains unbroken, a testament to his unwavering spirit amidst the intimidating atmosphere.

<font color = white>&#34;..of the Satetsu. But soon everyone will call me the Kraken Slayer.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If my soldier says they will obtain a title then that it is how it will be.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Do you understand?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stared in complete astonishment. Beginning to wonder if this boy named <i>Blast</i> was sent here by some cosmic entity.. Though - sleep or not.. Still or not! 

                         <b><i>HE HAD A JOB TO DO.</b></i>

Manipulating his body in such a dramatic fashion as if he was a <i>snake</i>. His presence looming over behind him. It was time. <b><i>Fifty damned Ryo was at stake!</b></i>
      <i><font color = white>&#34;Pin him down as I~...!&#34;</font></i>

The half-shark would grasp the top of his briefs, wasting no time before hopping over his body soon after. Delivering a <i>vicious</i> <b><i>WEDGIE</b></i>! Certainly giving Asa some flashbacks of his very own from the day prior. Landing over the boy he would stand proud. A grin sprayed over his face.

<b><i>The job.. was done.</b></i></font></font></font>

Sogeki thinks for a moment, then shrugs. He eases into the comfort of the topic.
  <font color = white>&#34;I do.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;But not without cause. Even if it&#39;s frowned upon by the public.. if it needs to be done. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Fine,&#34;</font> he starts, squeezing the boy&#39;s shoulder, <font color = white>&#34;Kraken Slayer must be earned.&#34;</font>

A punch occurs, far too fast to be seen by anyone around. It plants into Sogeki&#39;s stomach with cratering force.

His hand falls from the boy&#39;s shoulder, leaving them to relish in the impacts recoil.

<font color = white>&#34;Now. Why do I see someone giving wedgies?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) didn&#39;t care anymore. His face, having been pasted full of horror, stayed facing the ground. His tone speaking as if he was already dead.

<font color = white>&#34;..ok.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s body jerks forward as the veteran&#39;s fist slams into his stomach with brutal force. The impact sends a shockwave of pain through him, causing him to grit his teeth and stagger backward. His hands instinctively clutch at his abdomen, trying to alleviate the intense ache that spreads from the point of impact.

Despite the pain, Sogeki locks eyes with the crimson-haired veteran, his gaze unwavering. His pride refuses to let him show weakness or back down, even in the face of such a harsh lesson. He takes a deep breath, swallowing his pride along with the pain, and straightens up slowly, though the discomfort is evident on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand,&#34;</font> Sogeki manages to say through clenched teeth, his voice strained but defiant. He exhales sharply, willing himself to remain composed despite the throbbing pain in his gut. His eyes remain fixed on the veteran, a silent acknowledgment of the respect he holds for the commander&#39;s authority.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: One of you will be punished for unorderly conduct.

Then he broke the silence.

When he walked back over, she observed his demeanor and that call he made-- She, too, widened her eyes with shock. Not one ounce of her wanted to imagine what that felt like. 

Before she could offer a hand or deliver his justice..

He was gone.

<i>It seems her point had been made.</i></font></font></font>

    His arm sliding out of his sleeve as his upper body laid bare. Turning southbound to face Sogeki. The student granted the privilege of hunting and punching him. This was perfectly fine to him.

The neck of his cracked as he readied himself. His right hand raising itself, motioning in a &#39;<i>come on, then</i>&#39; gesture. Thus he spoke finally.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Hunt me? Fine then, let&#39;s do it. Punch me? Do it..</b>&#34;</font>, his finger pointed in Najiro&#39;s direction, his face grinning widely as he continued.

<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers: Give me 7 ryo...i'll pay you back and let you join my team

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) paces up to the half-shark, admiration for their acceptance of judgment clear upon his face. Though respect is established and recognized to be mutual, duty calls. Sogeki cocks his arm back and sends it flying towards the aquatic hybrid.

<font color = white>&#34;..for the Commander,&#34;</font> Sogeki whispers.

The impact of his action is felt heavily in the tense silence that follows, hanging in the air as a testament to the Commander&#39;s authority and the consequences of crossing it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) thought about it. Questions. Questions are important. Questions get answers. Questions like 'How hard is he going to punch Haginini? Is the commander a man or woman? Where are my shoes?'</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is good, Sogeki. Remember the pain I inflicted and unleash it upon the enemy tenfold.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That goes for all of you.
<br><font color=teal>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) whispers: What even is your team?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The things I have you do here are all sport but it is also preparation on how you should handle the real enemies.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) watches as the blow is being delivered to the shark. The girl winces slightly, thinking back to the <b>abuse</b> she&#39;d been subjected to from the big sword wielding girl.
    Iwa was in trouble if they planned on hitting people in the stomache. <i>These kids were going through a training regimine similar to that of the Shaolin monks where they may gain immunity to pain in an area by repeated trauma.</i>

<font color = white>&#34;Oof.&#34;</font> The girl uttered under her breath.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: In the future, when you are punched in the stomach, you will shrug it off. You will laugh at it because your Commander conditioned you so.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko(The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) OOCs: (Aint no way)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) trembles in place as she watches the powerful blow sent towards Jinbeisame. In a panic her mind raced, all she could think was...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) flinched a bit as they watched the Satetsu swing at the hoshigaki, their eyes noticing the tension in the boy's arm, and they knew it would pack some power behind it.
'It's....the commander's orders...'
They thought solemnly, finding their resolve for the task after this, knowing that the commander's favor could change their fate significantly.</font></font></font>

She makes a mental note to hide something under her hoodie to cushion some of these punches in the future.
   <font color = white>&#34;Maybe a trash can lid,&#34;</font> she mumbles under her breath.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) took the hit full-on. His face grimacing for a moment. <i>Just one moment.</i> Before it morphed back into it&#39;s previous position. His teeth being gritted before his posture straightened up. 

        Moving along to the side, letting the next recipient take their turn in receiving the punch from the fellow student, Sogeki.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>I &#39;ave no plan on running for a head-start in th&#39;hunt.. That shows cowardice.. I&#39;ll take m&#39;stand &#39;ere..</b>&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Evade their traps and flee.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) clenched his teeth as the punch connects with the half-shark.

<font color = white>&#34;<i>I&#39;ll be the best psychopath.&#34;</font></i> he thought, trying to remain positive.</font></font></font>
