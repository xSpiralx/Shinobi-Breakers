<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (sorry, nearly done with this code.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) entered the bustling courtyard of the Ninja Academy of Amegakure, his tall figure draped in a dark cloak that contrasted sharply with the vibrant uniforms of the students. His demeanor exuded a controlled aggression, evident in the furrowed brows and the smug curl of his lips. Beside him walked Kryu, another figure clad in standard shinobi attire, blending into the background of the bustling academy scene.

As they moved among the academy students engaged in training, Sogeki's piercing gaze swept over them in a swift, calculated manner. Each glance was brief yet impactful, leaving an unmistakable impression of authority and power. Kryu, a mere silhouette beside Sogeki, mirrored his intensity with a quiet determination, contributing to the palpable tension in the air.

The students, accustomed to rigorous training and the presence of senior instructors, couldn't help but feel the weight of Sogeki and Kryu's presence. Some straightened instinctively under their scrutiny, while others exchanged nervous looks. Their silent observation seemed to cast a shadow over the courtyard, a reminder of the harsh realities of ninja life.

Amidst the training exercises and the senior instructor's commands, Sogeki and the shadowy figure of Kryu remained a focal point, their quiet yet formidable presence leaving an indelible mark on the young aspiring shinobi of Amegakure. Together, they embodied a potent combination of controlled aggression and disciplined resolve, setting a standard that few dared to challenge.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) smirked.

<font color = white>&#34;Got it.&#34;</font>
His finger finally landing a grappled connection with the booger. Then retreating from his nostril and removing it from the deep corner it was lodged in.

Flicking it off his finger in the direction of the two behind him without knowing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: Was bigger than I thought.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked; she didn&#39;t move nor did she react in any method. The young one was more then capable of raising his brow as he stared, and slowly her hands eased back behind her back. 

A softly tsk formed from her lips; the young looking yer older dark-skinned young woman appeared out of place. Her attire an oddity, and yet she adorned a massive assortment of weapons upon her frame. 

The most outstandish being a rather hefty looking ornate looking blade attached to her hip. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm...,&#34;</font>

Her eyes shifted, and she peered forth upon those around her - she held back for now on how she wished to speak. She was a vice, a woman of cold, and blunt nature yet she carried herself with the mannerisms of experience and aggressive training. 

A twist of her frame, agile, and daft while she turned to stare at everyone with a mere spin before she finally took a step forward, and shifted her back away from those within the area. 

She simply stared. She wanted to know who was speaking, so that she may hopefully avoid having to deal with such things. She hated long talks, and honestly hated most people. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I would advise against such outlandish and potentially harmful aspects.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Should one find reasons, many of which find reasons for no purpose they might just end up attacking you for flicking that about.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It would ruin my fun if you got hurt over such childish reasons.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) observes the interaction silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) After a minute or so of silent observation, Sogeki realized that this courtyard wasn&#39;t the one designated for the combat trials. Annoyance etched deeper lines onto his visage, furrowing his brows and tightening his lips into a displeased frown. His icy gaze swept across the surroundings with a hint of frustration, silently criticizing himself for the oversight.

The revelation disrupted the atmosphere of controlled tension he had cultivated, causing a momentary ripple of confusion among the academy students who had felt his intimidating presence. Finally breaking his silence, Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd.

<font color = white>&#34;Where&#39;s the fight happening?&#34;</font> His tone was clipped and assertive, demanding immediate clarity amidst the unexpected setback. The question hung in the air, drawing all eyes to him briefly before a senior instructor stepped forward to redirect everyone to the correct location.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) extends his left pinky out and then raises it. Moving it right to his ear and then beginning to dig inside of it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: Ah nice nice. Nothing beats digging out built up wax.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) drifts his gaze the crowd. As the various people he'd likely come to know as peers conversed and interacted there's a certain voice that cuts through the chatter. Sliding his gaze long the faceless mass it eventually falls on Sogeki.

The remnants of his question linger in the air for a moment and in response he simply blinks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) noticed the grandson of a revered hero actively ignoring him, which sparked a wave of frustration within him. How dare anyone dismiss him in such a manner? His annoyance turned to indignation as he locked his gaze on the white-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, you better clean out those crusted ears! I know you heard me, nerd!&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice carried across the courtyard, sharp with irritation. His words were a challenge, laced with authority and demanding respect. <font color = white>&#34;Where&#39;s the fight happening!?&#34;</font> He emphasized each word, his tone leaving no room for disobedience or evasion.

The students nearby glanced nervously between Sogeki and the white-haired boy, sensing the tension crackling in the air. The grandson of the hero hesitated for a moment, visibly caught off guard by Sogeki&#39;s direct approach. Before he could respond, a senior instructor intervened swiftly, redirecting attention to the correct location of the combat trials.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm, maybe all of you won't die after all.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: But, I'm going for a walk around the village - if you end up in a fight don't cause any damage to the village or I'll personally drown you in the lake.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s frustration simmered as he redirected his focus to the dark-skinned dancer, recognizing her as the only person who seemed truly present among the indifferent crowd. In his eyes, the others were mere zombies or filler, lacking the vitality he sought.

<font color = white>&#34;We can fight as long as no damages? Hmm.&#34;</font> Sogeki smirked, his tone challenging and provocative. <font color = white>&#34;No promises!&#34;</font>

He stepped forward with purpose, intending to intercept her departure and assert his presence, though not necessarily dominance.

<font color = white>&#34;G&#39;day,&#34;</font> he greeted, the aggression in his voice tempered with a hint of restraint. It was clear Sogeki possessed some degree of manners, even in his confrontational approach. His demeanor conveyed authority, yet there was a nuanced respect in his interaction with her, acknowledging her as a potential challenger rather than dismissing her outright.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Seems more people are here, right now... Odd, I thought the Monument-area would have been a more crowded area.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked, she had begun walking away to begin her joyous and rather calming walk amongst the village she lived within. A softly jingle of coin could be noted, a section of coins locked upon silk-threads were placed at her hip. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? Good day,&#34;</font>

She replied in a rather simple, blunt and cold method. Her head slowly turned to face him, and those hands fastened behind her back promptly. 

   <font color = white>&#34;All damages inflicted to the village will be inflicted to you,&#34;</font>

She reaffirmed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) takes his pinky out of his ear and wipes the wax off the tip of it on the wall nearby.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Welp.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (Welp*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s gaze narrowed slightly as he observed the dark-skinned dancer&#39;s demeanor, noting the jingle of coins at her hip and the poised stance she held. Her blunt and cold reply didn&#39;t faze him; if anything, it piqued his interest further.

<font color = white>&#34;All damages inflicted to the village will be inflicted to you,&#34;</font> she asserted firmly.

Sogeki&#39;s smirk deepened as he unfolded his arms and casually scanned her attire, assessing her as a shinobi based on what he could discern. Her silk-threaded coins hinted at a blend of agility and resourcefulness, likely indicating proficiency in movement-based techniques.

With a nonchalant shrug, Sogeki met her gaze evenly. <font color = white>&#34;How about this,&#34;</font> he began, his tone carrying a hint of challenge. <font color = white>&#34;You become my direct mentor. I&#39;m sure you have plenty to teach me.&#34;</font> His demand was bold and direct, reflecting his confidence and disregard for the consequences she warned of.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) walks to the group of civilians while sipping on her iced coffee.A loud slurping noise can be heard as the girl reached the bottom of her drink.

<font color = white>&#34;That was good,I can finally start my day.&#34;</font>she said while shaking her bottle causing the ice to bang on the inside of the bottle<font color = white>&#34;So how is everyone today?I hope all is good or are we just standing here waiting for something to happen?&#34;</font>

The girl seemed a bit snarky as if she was some type of mean girl or something.Her eyes would size everyone up and down before casting judgment on their fit.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh hello,how&#39;s it going miss?&#34;</font>she said while waving at the darkskin lady<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re never hard to find.....if we were in a book you&#39;d be considered a main character based off how you stick out.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) As Daigen made his way through the training grounds, he noticed a small, tranquil body of water nearby. The surface was still, reflecting the cloudy sky and the surrounding trees with mirror-like clarity. Drawn to the calmness of the scene, he walked over and stood at the water&#39;s edge, gazing at his own reflection.

For a moment, he stared into his own eyes, seeing the determination and resolve that had driven him through countless hours of training. The reflection seemed to challenge him, a reminder of the strength he was striving to achieve.

<font color = white>&#34;Time to push myself even further,&#34;</font> he murmured to himself.

Taking a deep breath, Daigen stepped back from the water&#39;s edge and assumed a fighting stance. He began to practice shadow sparring, imagining an opponent in front of him. His movements were precise and fluid, each punch and kick executed with perfect form.

He moved swiftly, his fists slicing through the air as he threw a series of rapid punches. His legs followed with powerful kicks, each one controlled and focused. The reflection in the water provided a silent audience, mirroring his every move.

Daigen shifted his stance, incorporating dodges and counterattacks into his routine. He visualized his imaginary opponent&#39;s moves, reacting with speed and agility. His body moved instinctively, the countless hours of training evident in his fluid motions.

As he sparred, Daigen&#39;s mind focused entirely on his movements. The world around him seemed to fade away, leaving only the sound of his breath and the rhythm of his attacks. He pushed himself harder, his strikes becoming more intense and powerful.

Occasionally, he glanced at his reflection, using it as a guide to correct his form and technique. The still water provided a unique perspective, allowing him to see his own movements from a different angle. He adjusted his stance and strikes, ensuring each one was as effective as possible.

Minutes turned into an hour as Daigen continued his shadow sparring. Sweat began to bead on his forehead, but he paid it no mind, his focus unwavering. He practiced a variety of techniques, from basic punches and kicks to more complex combinations and maneuvers.

Finally, after an intense session, Daigen paused to catch his breath. He stood at the water&#39;s edge once more, his reflection now showing a shinobi who had pushed himself to the limit. The calmness of the scene contrasted sharply with the intensity of his training, creating a sense of balance and harmony.

<font color = white>&#34;One step at a time,&#34;</font> he repeated to himself, feeling a renewed sense of determination.

With a final nod to his reflection, Daigen turned away from the water and began to walk back towards the training grounds. He felt a deep sense of accomplishment, knowing that he had taken another important step on his journey to becoming one of the strongest shinobi Amegakure had ever seen.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked. Her attention drawn for the moment, and slowly she smirked. 

   <font color = white>&#34;My mentorship requires one to earn it,&#34;</font>

She slowly moved towards this young man, the one that held the mettle of being the Grandson of a Hero. Those subtle steps were nearly silent, each step slow, and focused - if he didn&#39;t flee?

He would only know truly understand what she had planned to do. A hand extended, and if she wasn&#39;t stopped? She would rather easily motion to fling that man up and into the air. 

A rather jolting motion, and the direct was towards the nearby lake. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? A main character? I suppose my attire is noticable,&#34;</font>

She moved to return to her spot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would nod her head even though she was more so talking about her skin color compared to all the pale skinned people around her who seemed to hate the sun rays</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) narrows his eyes on Sogeki and the dancer from afar. He hadn't taken him for the type to ask for mentorship. In what he'd briefly seen of him he seemed closer to a brute of some kind. His head slowly tilts to the side as his eyes trail along the woman's movements.

In one swift motion she watches the woman attempt to throw them into the waters and in this he looks toward the newcomer on his right.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) waves at the group in the area before resuming his training regiment. 

The boy had plenty of time to increase his skills for the upcoming duties he would have a ninja so he would take advantage of it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would turn around and saw a boy standing behind her.As she took a look at him she would get scared a bit.

Blinking a few times he noticed he was mid air. Spiraling about like a ball thrown in the air. Not a single clue as to how he even got up here. <font color = white>&#34;Sheesh.

<font color = white>&#34;Wait wait wait... What...?&#34;</font>

He would raise his hands up and push away anything she would try to offer him.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you think I&#39;m a begger...?&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s focus remained unwavering amidst the chaos that often swirled around him. While his classmates indulged in various extracurricular activities, he remained singularly dedicated to forging a path towards a stronger future. The petty distractions of others held no sway over his ambitions or principles.

His determination to establish a solid foundation for himself was palpable, driving him to hone his skills relentlessly. Whether in combat training or mastering advanced techniques, Sogeki pushed himself with unwavering discipline. The fleeting pursuits and diversions of his peers were inconsequential in his pursuit of mastery and excellence.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me,&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the ambient noise, his tone laced with arrogance and confidence as he turned to the dark-skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;How does one earn the honor of becoming your first and most important pupil?&#34;</font> His gaze locked onto hers, challenging and expectant, as if daring her to recognize his potential and skill.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) would narrow his eyes at her once again, getting more and more confused by the second.

<font color = white>&#34;N-no... It&#39;s just my hairstyle and I like it... I don&#39;t need a haircut.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d proceed to raise his hands up to cover his head and protect his hair from the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Mugen, Yurei (The long-haired boy-Mirageman) kept his hands to his side and then looked over with a light smile to those of his right. His long tied hair swayed in the soft undiffused evening breeze.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had returned to her place, and stood there once more with her hands nestled behind her back. A poised stance, one of experience past her years, and it honestly showed. 

She didn&#39;t even make notice of the young lad drowning - he would learn to swim, or he would sink. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? My methods are harsh, brutal, and often end the lives of those wishing to learn to become like me if they survive? Often more then not they are crippled. Train, and show me that you can survive - then we can see,&#34;</font>

She answered simply.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) When the soft spoken lass leaped in to the water, they&#39;d see the white-haired boy with his legs and arms crossed relaxing in the water. As if taking a break before decided to resurface.

A wave given and then <font color = white>&#34;..hllphb.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say as air bubbles escaped his mouth when speaking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do not baby Genin, I am not here to coddle you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) 
As Daigen left the tranquil training area and walked towards the busier parts of Amegakure, he soon found himself in a crowded marketplace. The vibrant energy of the village was palpable, with merchants calling out their wares, villagers chatting animatedly, and children running about. The contrast to the solitude of his training ground was stark, but Daigen moved through the crowd with ease, his senses alert and focused.

His attention was drawn to a dark-skinned woman standing in the center of the bustling crowd. She had an air of confidence and charisma that seemed to captivate those around her. The crowd’s attention was firmly fixed on her, and she spoke with a commanding presence that demanded respect.

Daigen didn't approach her directly. Instead, he found a spot nearby where he could observe without drawing too much attention to himself. Leaning against a wall, he watched as the woman engaged with the people around her. She spoke passionately about something, her gestures animated and expressive. 

He tried to discern what she was saying from a distance. Her voice, though clear, was drowned out by the general noise of the market. However, her body language and the reactions of the crowd spoke volumes. She appeared to be a figure of some importance or influence, and the villagers seemed to hang on her every word.

Daigen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he observed. He noted the way she commanded the space around her, the way people leaned in to listen, the respect evident in their expressions. There was something about her that intrigued him, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. 

His thoughts wandered as he considered the possibilities. Who was this woman? What role did she play in the village? Was she a shinobi, a leader, or perhaps someone with a different kind of influence? 

For now, Daigen chose to remain an observer. He knew that understanding the people around him, especially those who commanded such attention, could be crucial. He continued to watch, taking in every detail, from her expressions to her interactions with the crowd.

Though he didn’t make a move to approach her, Daigen stored away this moment in his mind. One day, it might prove useful to know more about the influential figures within his village. For now, he would remain in the background, learning what he could from the shadows.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) shook his head silently as he turned toward the ongoing conversation between who he'd assumed to be the instructor and his peers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Then again.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) blinked again slolwy, at this point he was beginning to get self conscious about his hair, was it really that bad?

<font color = white>&#34;No... I love my family. What&#39;s wrong with my hair? I think it looks cool, I go out every day looking like this.&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t know how to deal with this, he had never experienced this sort of interaction before.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do believe I have to teach some method of fundamental Taijutsu and Kenjutsu.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) gave the white-haired boy a dumbfounded look, before pouting as she&#39;d fold her arms.
The boy was likely a Hozuki, Shinobi of Water.
<font color = white>&#34;Well crud...&#34;</font> She&#39;d think, seeing how her help wasn&#39;t even neccessary.

Then, the realization set in further, and she couldn&#39;t help but smile at the boy, waving back at him before pointing up, as she decides it was best to leave the boy in his &#39;area of expertise&#39;, and to have some fresh air, herself, climbing out of the water, soaking wet, afterwards.</font></font></font>

The boy picked up on a few key details, noticing how the woman often spoke about improvements and benefits for the village. It became cleaer that she was a local leader.
Satisfied with the information he had gathered, Daigen leaned back against a railing and took a deep breath while analyzing and channeling the information he had received.

He would mutter to himself before perking up again as she spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh uh... Um... Well... It&#39;s been going well? Nothing super exciting... Just some training. What about you...?&#34;</font>

He scrutinized Daigen for a solid minute, weighing the request and considering the implications.

Finally, Sogeki shrugged nonchalantly and extended his arm towards Daigen. <font color = white>&#34;If we train together, that makes us one step closer to being brothers. You understand that, right?&#34;</font> His tone was serious yet tinged with a hint of camaraderie. <font color = white>&#34;Only thing left is a nice cup of sake to seal the deal.&#34;</font>

They looked to Botan, who was still nearby.
<font color = white>&#34;Maybe even ask a chuunin to oversee it as well....it could get the other students interested in participating.&#34;</font>
It was a simple suggestion, but to them, it would give the students more motivation to join them as they could show off what they knew to the higher-ups.</font></font></font>

Sogeki&#39;s gaze sharpened as he assessed the girl with the enchanted aura who had just addressed him. Her confident demeanor and the way she sized him up did little to faze him; if anything, it sparked his interest.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Sogeki,&#34;</font> he replied evenly, his voice carrying a hint of curiosity and a touch of his usual assertiveness. He met her gaze squarely, his own aura of determination and readiness palpable. <font color = white>&#34;And I&#39;m interested in anyone who&#39;s worth knowing,&#34;</font> he added, a slight smirk playing on his lips. <font color = white>&#34;Anyone can be either a training partner.. punching bag.. or more.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s demeanor was akin to a tightly wound spring, his temper simmering just beneath the surface as he listened to Rose&#39;s assessment. Her casual amusement at his presence and her focus on education sparked a familiar intensity within him, reminiscent of Bakugo&#39;s fiery determination.

<font color = white>&#34;Rose,&#34;</font> Sogeki acknowledged with a nod, his voice edged with a hint of challenge. He clasped her hand firmly, his grip assertive yet controlled. <font color = white>&#34;Education&#39;s important, sure. But so is proving yourself in the field,&#34;</font> he remarked, his tone carrying a confident edge.

He couldn&#39;t help but notice her lingering smile, and the thought that she considered him merely another challenge only fueled his competitive spirit. <font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll see how things unfold,&#34;</font> he thought to himself, a small smirk crossing his lips. Sogeki was determined to surpass her expectations, to demonstrate his strength and skill in ways that would demand respect.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s work together then,&#34;</font> he said aloud, his voice carrying a challenge disguised as cooperation. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure you remember me.&#34;</font> With that, Sogeki released her hand and stood tall, ready to prove himself in whatever challenges lay ahead.

Though their interaction turned out differently than he anticipated, Sogeki still holds himself to a reserved stature. Rose could be a better friend and ally-- prolly more than anything else. Only time will tell.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Plus you get to see how you stack up to your peers
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, his mind instantly racing to address Rose&#39;s inquiry with his signature arrogance and pride. This challenge was an opportunity to assert himself and motivate others to step up.

<font color = white>&#34;The way I see it,&#34;</font> Sogeki began, his voice carrying an edge of aggressiveness and determination. <font color = white>&#34;We pool our ryo into a pot. The top three winners of the tournament not only claim their share of the pot but earn the right to brag. But here&#39;s the real deal,&#34;</font> he continued, his smirk widening as his arrogance shone through. <font color = white>&#34;Those top three? They&#39;re not safe. Anyone who didn&#39;t make it can challenge them. It&#39;s about more than winning; it&#39;s about proving you&#39;re the best.&#34;</font>

He paused for a moment, his gaze sweeping over the gathered peers. <font color = white>&#34;This tournament isn&#39;t just a chance to compete. It&#39;s a chance to show who&#39;s at the top and who&#39;s willing to fight to stay there,&#34;</font> he declared boldly, his tone challenging yet encouraging. <font color = white>&#34;So if you&#39;ve got any guts, if you think you&#39;ve got what it takes, step up. Train hard. Because this isn&#39;t just about dominance--it&#39;s about maintaining it.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s words hung in the air, a call to action wrapped in his trademark arrogance and pride. He knew his aggressive approach might rub some the wrong way, but he also understood the necessity of pushing his peers to strive for excellence, both individually and collectively.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would nod their head which would give off the notion that she was considering in joining this little game of theirs.In reality Rose had already made up he mind and figured just by watchng the fight would give her a better out look on things compared to joining the action.

<font color = white>&#34;I see it does sound amazing,but i&#39;m going to have to decline.&#34;</font>A smile continued to linger on her face.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eye would squint at the short red-heared boy, <font color = white>&#34;Oh your Uzumaki too?

Higane&#39;s right hand meets her chin, slightly obscurring her lips as she chuckles.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Nice to meet you and I&#39;m sure it will be easy to remember your name cousin!&#34;</font> He yelled out a bit, looking towards his cousin&#39;s head.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) arrives on the scene of the streets, where it seemed students were eager to start some kind of something. As an elder of the village, it wouldn’t go unnoticed.

<font color = white>&#34;And what have we here?&#34;</font> He asks in a very skeptical tone, brow raised behind the darkness of the hood and mask</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Alright ima go hand in the scroll then.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (test
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the mask man stopping mid step with a scroll in his hand.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh...Hello.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) wafts his hand about his nose, not much liking the smell of cabbage. Thankfully the smell didn’t really stick.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello young....student. What is all of this commotion....&#34;</font> he trails off, looking at the gathered many before continuing. But as if it were a new statement. <font color = white>&#34;About.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uzumaki, Nakagawa (The short red-headed boy-Godlike2909) glanced toward the commanding man, giving him a once over before he lowered down onto the ground, taking a seat.

<font color = white>&#34;Some kind of tournament is happening or something&#34;</font> He said as he raised and lowered his shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked flinched a bit as the commanding man waved his hand, and they felt self-conscious about their smell for a moment.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh, We are organizing a tournament amongst us students.
Miss Botan is going to oversee it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) Walks up to the group after hearing about a tournament and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh the kids are working on a little tourny, isnt that just fun.&#34;</font>

He continued to watch them to see how it woud progress.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) itches his chin for a moment, before loooking between the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Botan also going to be providing a reward?&#34;</font> He looks over to the Jonin, who would know this wasn’t a spectator from within the village. But one sent by the Shogun for the youth</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...i wonder if i can get wooden shurikens
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) spots the figure and offers a head nod. If he was luck it would be enough to lure him over to his side of the crowd. Should the jounin warp to his position a few words would be exchanged as they whispered to one another. Maintain a sense of privacy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) folds his arms while side-eyeing the jonin next to him. They reeked of something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) walks off to the side, half listening to what's going on behind him, while also just observing the body of water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shook their head.
<font color = white>&#34;They didn&#39;t offer one, so we were just going to try to pull whatever resources we had for the top three.&#34;</font>
They looked at the ground for a minute as so many high-ranking people appeared out of nowhere.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) kept herself still in the distance, their eyes seem to perk over towards the crowd with curiosity, the scroll carrier in the distance particularly catching up their attention, eyes press gently in a squeeze, only to widden again. They've managed to catch up the youngling's attention for the time being itseems.

A ceaseless, unblinking stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) noticing the boy nod to him he quickly walked around the group and made his way clumsily towards him. Not cool or interesting in the least. No teleporting or cool moves used. just akward <font color = white>&#34;excuse me, pardon me, sliding by&#34;</font> words as he made his way through the crowd. He would stop by the boy and smile. <font color = white>&#34;Need something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says:  We have nine people so if everyone pitched in it should be a nice little reward...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would pass the scroll to the commanding man showing them all the names</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I don't have any ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I am a jonin a rank above Chunin its nice to see so many new faces around here feels like this year is going to be an interesting one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) had paid close attention to the jounin as he drew closer to the cluster of children from the north. His posture, demeanor and tone seemed far too mature to be a chuunin. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Kryu&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You tell me..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Earlier people called themselfs bitch
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) squints her eyes from afar, nothing escapes the young girls vision.. Let alone a big celebrity like Shion.

<font color = white>&#34;Holy crap! It&#39;s Master Shion! He&#39;s like famous you know!?&#34;</font> She shouted over the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And their mother being a hoe
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Oh...another of the famous ones?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) reads through the scroll swiftly, with something tucked between the parchment now

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I can watch then 500 ryo goes to the victor, 250 to the runner-up&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) asks: A tournament? Now?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) He would present himself with a respecful standing expression and look at the young boy. <font color = white>&#34;You can call me-&#34;</font> He would hear the girl blurt out and he would stop looking respectful and start trying  to hide himself in his kimono.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Shion Aikawa nice to meet you.&#34;</font> He would say quickly trying to make his presense evaporate without success.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case...if they are given wooden weapons can i get wooden throwable ones.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) Looked to Higange Hyuuga as they shouted over the crowd for a moment before the commanding man spoke.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh...Of course, you can watch!&#34;</font> They yelled in excitement as it seemed they now had a prize.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: I'm Higane! Of the Hyuuga family, my brother is a big fan of yours!
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) yells: Miss Botan!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: Pathetic.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) ran up to the Chuunin with a scroll in his hands.
<font color = white>&#34;We did.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (Someone drop me a single ryo pls rq u will get it back)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) takes a deep breath and sighs.

<font color = white>&#34;Is he now. I am honoured. Uhm Higane was it. Could you lower your voice a little.&#34;</font>

He looked around hoping people would continue what they were doing. He gave her a polite yet akward smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Ah, you located a listing?
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I unfortunatly did not bring any weapons with me on my walk around the village.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) took a moment to obtain said scroll before she moved to unroll it, and thus begin to examine it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Nicely done and in a quick fashion,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It took a lot of work but we have Nine People for the Tournament.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It seems to make it even, we need one more.

He pivots smoothly, evading Higane&#39;s makeshift senbon with a sidestep that seems almost effortless. The wooden needles whistle past him harmlessly, grazing the air where he had stood just moments before.

A dark glint flashes in Sogeki&#39;s eyes as he retrieves a pair of wooden kunai from his own kit with a fluid motion. His expression remains stoic, but a simmering intensity radiates from him, an unsettling aura that seems to pulse with anticipation.

He takes a deliberate step forward, closing the distance between them with a predator&#39;s grace. The arena around them seems to hold its breath, the tension thickening with each passing second.

Sogeki moves decisively, launching one of the wooden kunai towards Higane. It cuts through the air with precision, a silent declaration of his intent and skill. The blade&#39;s trajectory is aimed to test her reflexes, a challenge laid down in the quiet confrontation unfolding between them.

<i>Woosh!</i> The kunai whistles past her long black hair as she ducks bellow it, entering a low stance and releasing a new set of senbon at her oponent with a swift step backwards. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. three left.&#34;</font> She mumbled as her fingers fidget with her shinobi kit.

Her determination and adaptability are evident as she enters a low stance, preparing her next move with a swift step backwards. He senses her calculating gaze and the tension in the air thickens as she readies her next set of senbon.

Moving with controlled aggression, Sogeki closes the distance between them with deliberate steps. He weaves and sidesteps, evading the incoming senbon with fluid movements that speak of honed skill and instinct. Each step he takes is purposeful, a silent dance of anticipation and readiness.

His focus remains locked on Higane, studying her movements and adjusting his strategy accordingly. Sogeki doesn&#39;t rush into action just yet, opting instead to observe and assess his opponent&#39;s tactics. His expression is unreadable, a mask of calm amidst the flurry of movement and tension surrounding them.

As Higane mutters to herself about her remaining senbon, Sogeki&#39;s smirk returns briefly, a silent acknowledgment of the challenge she presents. He knows this won&#39;t be an easy match, but that only fuels his determination to prove his strength and skill in the unfolding confrontation.

A swift step back into a shallow rotation of her hips allows her to launch the next set of senbon at her opponent with haste using the centrifugal force of her spin.

Her strategy of shoot and evade challenges him to adapt and respond with equal precision. The senbon fly towards him, propelled by her practiced technique, but Sogeki remains calm amidst the storm of needles.

He smirks faintly at her taunt, a glint of amusement dancing in his eyes. His steps are measured and deliberate as he continues to close the distance between them. Evading the projectiles with deft movements, he waits patiently, timing his response with calculated precision.

As the last senbon whizzes past him, Sogeki seizes the moment. With a sudden burst of speed and agility, he launches himself towards Higane. His movements are swift and decisive, closing the gap between them in a heartbeat. His hands blur as he prepares to strike, ready to test her defenses and assert his dominance in the arena.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s brow furls in confusion. Regardless of her ongoing attacks, Sogeki&#39;s heart seemed as charismatic as his words. His fightning spirit unwavered as he begun to close the gap.

Small beads of sweat form behind the girls nape.. <font color = white>&#34;Ah shit, last two huh..&#34;</font> She whimpered as she launched her second to last set of senbon at Sogeki.

The moment it was released from her flicked wrist, Higane&#39;s eyes narrowed realizing that this would be a direct <i>hit!</i>

<font color = white>&#34;Thats gona be a nasty splinter!&#34;</font> She shouted out to her classmate as a nervous smile painted her face.

His tactical adjustment had cost him footing, and in that moment of vulnerability, he saw Higane&#39;s senbon closing in.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn,&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath, his eyes narrowing with determination. Swiftly drawing one of his remaining sets of senbon from his own kit, he thrust them forward in a calculated clash of wood against wood, intercepting Higane&#39;s projectiles with precision.

The clash echoed through the arena, the sound of wood meeting wood reverberating in the tense silence. Sogeki held his ground, his movements deliberate and controlled as he advanced slowly. His focus intensified, a silent determination radiating from him despite the setback.

With each measured step forward, Sogeki recalibrated his strategy. He needed to close the distance effectively, relying on his remaining weaponry and his own skills to turn the tide in his favor. His eyes locked on Higane, calculating his next move as he prepared to engage with renewed resolve.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As the senbon flew towards him, Sogeki&#39;s focus intensified. Despite his efforts to intercept them, one of the needles found its mark, grazing his arm and embedding itself deeply. He winced at the sharp sting, but his resolve remained unbroken.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah!&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted through clenched teeth, feeling the sting of the senbon piercing his flesh. He quickly pulled it out with a swift motion, blood trickling down his arm. Ignoring the pain, he maintained his steady advance towards Higane.

His gaze locked onto her, his expression hardening with determination. The injury fueled his fighting spirit rather than weakening it. With a determined grunt, Sogeki pushed through the discomfort, his movements fluid and focused.

Closing the gap with unwavering resolve, he pressed forward despite the injury, ready to meet Higane&#39;s next move head-on. His mind raced with strategies, adapting to the evolving dynamics of their confrontation. Sogeki knew that every moment counted now, and he was determined to prove his strength and resilience in the face of adversity.

Let&#39;s do it!&#34;</font> She shouted as the wooden needle flew across the makeshift arena.

The moment the needle is released, Higane gets low to the ground, widening her stance into a peculiar one.. Her right leg trails behind her as her left knee bends ahead her arms extend out in opposite directons.

<font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font> She shoute with vigor.

His eyes narrow with determination as he prepares to intercept or evade the incoming projectiles. However, just before he can react, Higane&#39;s voice rings out with unexpected intensity, shouting <font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font>

Confusion flickers across Sogeki&#39;s face for a moment. He doesn&#39;t recognize the term or understand its significance, but he senses the conviction in Higane&#39;s voice. Ignoring the unfamiliarity, he refocuses on the immediate threat of the senbon heading his way.

With a swift sidestep and a flick of his wrist, Sogeki manages to deflect some of the senbon, but one grazes his shoulder, drawing a sharp intake of breath from him. He winces at the pain but doesn&#39;t falter. His mind races, recalibrating his approach as he continues his determined advance towards Higane.

His strategy remains unchanged: assert dominance, prove his strength, and seize control of the confrontation. The unfamiliar technique Higane mentioned is momentarily set aside in his mind as he readies himself for the next exchange, focused on the immediate challenge before him.

'Might as well get a good idea of the foot work...', he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s smile slowly creeps up her face as she snickers outloud.. <font color = white>&#34;Whats wrong?! Not closing in anymore! You&#39;re in range!&#34;</font>

The young girl holds her stance, and remains still. Her resolve steadfast. It could have all ended here.. But Sogeki&#39;s attitude begun to irritate her.. slowly wilting away her patience. <font color = white>&#34;You talk so high and mighty, but you don&#39;t understand what its like to be revered! What it&#39;s truly like to be thought of as an elite...&#34;</font> She stopped herself halfway..

Her teeth audibly grit making a low grinding sound. <font color = white>&#34;The pressure... the damn pressure..&#34;</font> She concluded, as her stance seemed to waiver and almost crumble.. no longer did she look as agile and intimidating.
