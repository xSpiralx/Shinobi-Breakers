<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) nods-- mostly to herself.

     <font color = white>&#34;You made it sound like people don&#39;t really want to talk to you. That and you talk kind of..&#34;</font>

Her free hand idly moves as she searches for the word.

<font color = white>&#34;Proper?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: I don't know... Didn't Najiro just run your pockets?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: he accepted a dice game,so did i
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Don't worry about another Shinobis pockets.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both parties agree to it.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: But i stay with Ryo just so you know.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stretches his hand back and forth, massaging out the pain. <font color = white>&#34;Couldn&#39;t be me... That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (lol the irony of the amount of bullying Asa's taken mixed witht he fact he's currently shoeless
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Aren't you the one being thrown at a lake,got a wegie by a construction worker,and got your hand broken by trying to hit the croutch of said guy
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Did you see that guy?  He was a unit...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If im you? i might watch my words from now on
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I had a lapse in judgment. Won't happen again.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I was the one thrown in the lake.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: But it seems yall are fine over here so im heading to the cafe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) pursed his lips, looking at Najiro through slitted eyes. <font color = white>&#34;Naji, I&#39;m the biggest hater. I won&#39;t lower my tone because that guy was bricked up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) waves to the group before turning to depart</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) waved as the cabbage reeking individual left.

     <font color = white>&#34;Take care.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Hana and simply say

<font color = white>&#34;More of most people sleep,and i read alot.But anyway,i won&#39;t ask anymore questions,if thats what you want.&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (to react?
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Oh. I need to warn that guy about the shoe eating sharks.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He blames a fellow student for his missing shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Eh? We eat shoes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: News t'me.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Thats his issue.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns towards the voice.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a sha--..&#34;</font>

She trails off, the obvious note of his features coming into play.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh. Right.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Meh, I'm jus' here to make money, 'nd serve my nation, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Sounds simple enough to me!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Right?! Simple as all things should be, mhm-mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah,yeah...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Just don't act without a single thought inside your heads.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Eh? What would make you think I'd do that..?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I plan to live a fulfilled life - I can't be acting reckless.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: Is that the kind of energy I have..?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: No,but few people do
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm questioning that about myself, as well..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Especally the guy about eating shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: With how he acted today...im fully convinced he will just get into trouble always
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: As for you Hana,haven't seen enough of you to make a clear desicion on what type of person are you.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Well that's just..
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Hmm.. It kind of means a lot to judge the way someone's life is going to go after one day.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im weeks with the guy.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He begin their negativity against me after i  gave up in a sparring match
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: You.. gave up? How come?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It was a tournament set up by fellow students,hosted by one of the jounins.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I gave up cause the fight was simply dragging too damn much
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If one didn't pursuit the other they quickly regain their breath and continue to fight.Due to us being students this becomes too easy..so a strategic fight cannot really happen
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) folds her arms across her chest. Her head tilts as she follows the boy&#39;s words. Eventually, she--

     <font color = white>&#34;You say a lot of words..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Indeed!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Learn t'condense 'em!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: To put it in a simple manner,he hates how i didn't continued the fight and pursuit untill one of us loses.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And sees my actions as being a coward.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Blah blah blah blah blah.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Put simply, screw what other people say - jus' do you, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: The Shark has a point.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Jinbeisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you think i don't know this? Im not bothered by their words,im simply dissapointed by their behavior
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will call you Jinby.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) walked up to the still-gathered group and overheard the end of the conversation. He frowned, his brow furrowing. <font color = white>&#34;You have a bad opinion of me for wanting you to do better? Hm...&#34;</font> Asa shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets. <font color = white>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Jinbei or Jinby, I don't care which!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I like Jinby better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, raising a finger as she blurts out--

     <font color = white>&#34;Beisame!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Beisame.. Sure.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Kfhfhfh... Beisame has a ring to it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its the fact how you acted.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And what you faced as consequences today.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I am who I am.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Do you take me to be ashamed of what happened today? Embarrasses, maybe, Not ashamed. Every defeat is a lesson.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (embarrassed*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) I thought Jinby was pretty good...
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his chin. Repeating the name to himself multiple times. A multitude of names he would need to grow attached too.
     <font color = white>&#34;Jus&#39; call me whatever y&#39;like - so long as it&#39;s respectful - and I&#39;ll respond to it!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: So far 'Beisame' is in th'lead.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, you've got to include the 'same' part or thats just ignoring your family.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: hm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mhm, mhm. The 'Same' part is the most important bit.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Right! Exactly like I prefer 'Beisame', actually takes that factor into equation.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: And...why that part is so nessecary?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Wh-..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I think Jinby is the best.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (Shizuma is hoshigaki too ya know XD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, her brow narrowing at the boy&#39;s question. Her hand gestures towards Beisame-- mostly pointing towards the various visible shark features on his face.

     <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t tell?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (that hoshigaki from boruto
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Listen. Calling a Hoshigaki a name without 'same' is like calling a Senju a name without 'rama' , it's a bad omen.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: It'll ruin your karma.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will look at them both and say
<font color = white>&#34;Zama is also a name in their clan.Surprized nobody knows this&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: 'Rama is more relevant, though.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) nods, sagely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It's just the 'ama' part, isn't it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) nods in turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (*zuma
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Ame and Ama.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Im still going to call him, Jinby. Got it, sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sharky feels like a slur, almost.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It isn't?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm no rubber-ducky nor fuzzy plaything.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,what do you want to be your nickname
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I feel like they get a pass on account of the fact they're like... Small...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I'd be pretty upset if someone called me 'Sharky'.. Kind of down plays the whole family.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If it was anyone else it'd feel racially charged, but in this instance it feels like childlike innocence.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Oh shut your yapping, blondie.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmm, you may be right, cous'.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Sharky doesn't mind me calling him, Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: okay..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Now it's gettin' weird.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Do your, Sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: *you
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I don't feel th'need to repeat myself.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: i will go for a quick run across the village.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not talking to you, Jinby.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm talking to Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Keep up.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: So - my cousin?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: A.K.A., someone from my clan.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) dismissively waved her hand. Oddly enough, the comment didn&#39;t really have the same sting to it.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s just asking for one of them to get mad at you..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..just this group here.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: What does your clan have to do with knowing your name?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Or nickname rather? Nicknames are fun!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: What is this even about.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Nicknames for Hoshigaki.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I gave Jinby a nickname and someone said something about it being Ra-sh-a-ly charged.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I dont think they like me calling Sharky, Sharky....
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: But Sharky doesn't mind.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Uh-huh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....Anyway.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Well if they don't like it why not respect their wishes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I care less for it anymore.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: Who tells a little girl her nicknames are racist?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: thats a boy
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..Is it?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: It?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yuki clan have very feminine males.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) steps forward. Her hand comes to her chin as she glances over them.

    <font color = white>&#34;I.. can&#39;t really tell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: If it means anything.....I don't know any of you people names either.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Same, t'be fair.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Najiro. You need glasses my little shinobi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) loses their childlike innocense and glares at the profound blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Who are you calling it, you hag!?&#34;</font>, they exclaim, their face puffing and arms crossing across their small body.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: That's a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Both of them are sisters i think
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: How dare you misgender me cabbage breathe!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (OMIT)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) pointed at the two Yuki's</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....thats definatly a boy
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Oh with the exception of cabage breath over there.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (inserts 2024 lesson on gender pronouns into naruto game)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both are boys infact.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello Bill.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And My name is Najiro,Rose.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Hello, Perfume lady.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) gave Bill the senju nod of approval.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Little Girl tell Najiro to get his eyes checked.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Mind carrying my bags?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Little girl?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;H-Hag?&#34;</font>

The insult causes a visible recoil from the girl. Her entire aura shrinks as she recalls the second conversation she had with this group. There was no way she--

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not old! We&#39;re probably all the same age!&#34;</font> she shouts in protest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do it yourself
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm simply Jinbeisame, or as th'lady beside me called me, 'Beisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: They are not heavy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) points up at the older profound blonde. Their small frame still slightly dwarfed by the older child.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m 10. Your at least like...Like...16! You&#39;re ancient for a shinobi!&#34;</font>, he exclaims.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: And i'm Hannah Montana.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says:  Hey...can you tell him that you are a boy
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Everyone belives you are a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) asks: Hannah's a Boy?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Who is even Hannah?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Points at that Cold child</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) walked forward and stood beside the two students.
<font color = white>&#34;Aye, Hana, you are too old to get into it here with this kid, especially on the new bridge.&#34;</font>
He tucked away his touch and placed a hand on top of the cold child&#39;s head.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not a hag but...that early puberty hit you hard.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) feels a hand grasp the top of his head. Quickly, he scurries to the side to remove the unrequested touch and stands next to his cousin.

<font color = white>&#34;You mind your business too grandpa.&#34;</font>, he said, before turning his attention to the others who seemed to be debating over his gender.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t even look like a girl. I&#39;m clearly a boy!&#34;</font>, he says.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) glanced.. down? Wow. The kid really was shorter than her. Both of her fists came to her hips, her expression quickly shifting to showcase her brief stint of anger.

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only <i>thirteen</i>, smooth-bits! Don&#39;t get mad at me because you&#39;re stuck between a boy and a girl!&#34;</font>

She leans forward, an almost-visible spark of tension between the two shinobi. That was, well, until the cabbage-reeker stepped between them.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would move to stand next to his cousin. To be fair he himself looked far girlier than the other. But he wore traditional masculine clothes. That&#39;s probably what made him not be mistaken for a girl so often. He looks towards the other. <font color = white>&#34;Things could be far worse.&#34;</font>  He remarks with a little laugh, <font color = white>&#34;The real question is does our clan have any Girls, or will all the Hyuuga be too scared to check.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) squinted their eyes at the cold child, a thick vein appearing on their forehead at the kid&#39;s words.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only 13, you brat!&#34;</font>
Their hand shot into their pouch as they quickly lost their temper, not knowing why they tried to be the voice of reason when they had such a short fuse.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) brow twitched as the kid started making faces at them, and the veins on their forehead grew larger.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: To be honest, we should settle this with a game of 200, I'll hold the funds, too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) stops making faces and glares at Bill. The child-like jokes and aura instantly dissipating into an icy chill. His eyes would lock onto the cabbage haired elder child.

<font color = white>&#34;If you touch me, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</font>, he says, in a cold monotonous tone. His child-like immature visage being replaced with something much colder...Much more...sinister.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his hands together.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) locked eyes with the cold child as their aura shifted around them, and they felt a slight chill wash over them as they saw a rather severe look in the child&#39;s eyes.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, ya.&#34;</font>
They moved their hand forward, disregarding the sudden shift in the air as he touched the cold child&#39;s forehead and flicked them with a finger.
<font color = white>&#34;Then make me.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) stands still, the air around them seemingly thickening at the intensity radiating from this child. He would watch keenly, the boys hand seemingly moving in slow motion. However, he would not even need to react as the girl with the enchanted aura grabbed the cabbage boys hand.

<font color = white>&#34;You even move like an old man. You couldn&#39;t hit me with a strike that slow if you tried&#34;</font>, he said coldly, still having not moved an inch from where he stood.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With one more insult, she probably would have done what the cabbage-perfumed boy was doing.

For both of their sake, it was a good thing that he went before she could. Now, she just remained back to watch that scene unfold.

<font color = white>&#34;Knock it out, cabbage kid!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shifted their arm slightly, avoiding Rose&#39;s hand as he stared at the cold child. He placed his hands behind his head and sighed.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I think she saved you...At that speed you'd be lucky to hit a tiger-turtle while its sleeping!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) So much for letting things play out on their own.

Another insult tossed in the girl&#39;s direction immediately causes her to kiss her teeth. She rushes forward, the once-dying flame of anger relit within her spirit. It takes only a few strides for her to close the gap between herself and the androgynous youth. In that instant the gap is closed, her right hand curls into a fist.

     <font color = white>&#34;Shut... <b>UP!</b>&#34;</font>

Said fist is brought upward from the fiery blondes side. It rockets forward with accuracy and prowess unexpected of a girl of her stature and demeanor; danger lurking within just mere contact. All of that aggression is channeled into a mighty, organ rattling haymaker to the cold youth&#39;s stomach.

</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid insult when a lightning fast strike barrels toward their stomach. His senses pick up in the shift of the girl before she moves, however his small body is not trained enough for his reflexes to allow him to react. 

In an instant, he feels his stomach collapse in on itself, as a hand is buried into his abdomen. They feel themselves sent reeling backwards, their small hands grasping their stomach, as they fall to their knees.

<font color = white>&#34;Owww! How...How could you?! You evil, hag!&#34;</font>, he coughs and sputters attemping to catch his breathe. He would feebly get to his feet, spreading his legs in a battle stance. His cold intensity quickly returning, as he rushes the girl, his fist clenched as he attempts to punch her in her hag face.

<font color = white>&#34;Take this!&#34;</font>, he yells, as his fist surges towards her face at a speed that would only be impressive to a beginner academy shinobi.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) In that moment where her fist pushes into the cold youth's midsection, there's almost a euphoric feeling for the inflictor of pain. A sense of self-inflicted justice nearly erases that rage in just that one strike-- a proper punishment for an act that <i>surely</i> would lead to change.

It even reflects in her face; a pursed lip relaxes into an almost shit-eating grin.

<i>'Hag'</i>..

A shame that such 'happiness' is cut short by yet <i>another</i> insult upon her, this time paired with a strike at her person. She steps back, the gap in their height providing her an easy advantage to avoid its returned strike. All it takes is a simple lean to avoid that inexperienced strike.

The one that responds is nothing of the sort.

As fist fades past her face, her body drops down to <i>its</i> height. Her other hand curls up now and, yes again, poises to send yet another thunderous blow to his gut.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) grunts as he exerts his full force behind his strike, yet his fist is met with the cold emotionless embrace of empty space. This girl...She was no ordinary academy student, yet the young Yuki's pride would not let him give up as he quickl began formulating his next plan.

That would be in vain though, as in the same instant as his fist missed her face, he would be met by the thunderous impact of another fist to his midsection. The sickening sound of crunching bones, shattering ribs, and youthful screaming erupting into the air.

His cold eyes would roll to the back of his head, as he crumbled to the ground holding his stomach before lurching over face down. His mind would go blank as he met the cold embrace of oblivion..Or rather unconciousness.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) Another devastating shot to its core. Another feeling of relaxation. That scream it releases doesn&#39;t even register in the girl&#39;s head. Her fist relaxes, the palm catching the unconcious student as they fall forward. There comes only the slightest push-- a nudge to cause him to fall backwards rather than onto her.

A sigh of true relief exits her. With that situation handled, she turns back towards Beisame. Her stance relaxes back to its casual, laid back demeanor. There wasn&#39;t exactly a need to be hostile anymore.

     <font color = white>&#34;Can you believe that thing? How crazy!&#34;</font> She suggests, her finger pointing down towards their unconcious state.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) side eyes the profound blonde. It was noted not to mess with her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) let out a small but audible chuckle as he looked at the unconcious Yuki. Then back towards the profound blonde. His shoulders shifting as he shrugged, beginning to speak.
    <font color = white>&#34;My thoughts exact, I&#39;m glad it was settled though. Y&#39;have fun?&#34;</font>, he muttered. 

His gaze unwavering as if he had front-row seats to a boxing match. Even if in reality, this was a <i>squash match</i>, as they do in wrestling federations. Some form of pity was shared for the cold child. However, it was ultimately shrugged off - the <b>did</b> call his cousin <i>&#39;Sharky&#39;</i> after all. 
              Child or not, that shit won&#39;t chill.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Fun..?&#34;</font>

She pauses, her pointing finger instead coming up to her cheek where she lightly taps. There wasn&#39;t any particular word for what she felt doing that. &#39;Fun&#39; almost felt too simple. Anything extra would be doing too much. Unable to come up with a solution, she merely shrugged in response.

     <font color = white>&#34;I guess. He&#39;d just better watch his mouth next time...&#34;</font> she grumbles.</font></font></font>

Fun via combat was something that didn&#39;t <i>fancy</i> him per se. But there wwas definitely monetary value when it comes to <b>combat</b> and the likes. Something this kid had an eye for.

Was she joking? Or was this the start of her peeping era.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) scoffed at the very notion.

     <font color = white>&#34;If <i>it</i> decides <i>it</i> wants to jump me, that&#39;ll be the day I make <i>its</i> face a permanent part of the bridge.&#34;</font> she responds.

Even with that threat and notion, she can&#39;t help but try and shrug it off again.
