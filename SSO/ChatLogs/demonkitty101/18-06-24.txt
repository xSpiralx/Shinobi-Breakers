Ethereal golden chains materialize and shoot to keenly coil around Sogeki, the black-haired boy, and the stern boy.

They are held high into the air.

A muffled <i>clink, clank</i>

Parts of her black kimono have small torn pieces which expose the skin.. Small trails of blood drip down the three points of injury.

The young Hyuuga, quietly looks around, seemingly assessing the situation once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn.. chains..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Higane...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) descended gracefully towards the ground, the rush of air and the exhilaration of movement surrounding him. His keen senses and eagle-like eyesight allowed him to anticipate every detail, every motion around him, as if time slowed down. With precision honed through rigorous training, he prepared to land.

Just as he was about to touch down, an unexpected surge of chakra-infused chains wrapped around his limbs with startling force. His descent halted abruptly, twisting his body mid-air. Sogeki's eyes widened in surprise as he realized he was suddenly restrained, suspended in the air by unseen forces.

The chains held him firmly in place, suspending him above the ground. Sogeki's muscles tensed instinctively, his mind racing to comprehend the situation. Frustration and defiance welled up within him, yet he knew resisting now would only escalate the confrontation further.

Caught in the grip of the chakra chains, Sogeki's breaths came quick and controlled. He grappled with a mix of emotionsâ€”frustration at being restrained, respect for the Commander's authority, and a burgeoning sense of understanding the consequences of his actions.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You attacked first.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Throwing petty things like some ape.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Wait....I need someone to help me with my clothes.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Eh?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Order them to follow me around.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Am I gettin' paid for it..?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will not budge so much as a muscle until I say so.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: You probably shouldn't be helping people shop for clothes, man.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...maybe later rose,maybe later..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: Y'aint even have a shirt.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: I sure do need help with these bags.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) was plucked mid punch from his trajectory and hoisted into the air. He was far from pleased. He struggled against the chains, spouting insults and vulgarities. He didn&#39;t understand why this injustice was being allowed or why the commander himself was hurting Higane in that way. 

It would be fair to say he was quite ignorant to the nuances of the Hyuuga clans traditions. Even so, he wouldn&#39;t be happy with them regardless. He stopped struggling and narrowed his eyes, looking down at the Uzumaki. <font color = white>&#34;How dishonorable...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: Hard to object to something I've never heard of
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: So all of us against whoever hunts us down huh..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Naji is expelled and not to be treated as a student.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) dips a hand into her pocket and glances calculatively at the stern boy behind her.</font></font></font>
