<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to fight me right now?&#34;</font>

He turns to face Kyoko on that note, and takes a step away from the Hyuuga, turning his back towards her.

It was simply instilled at a young age he was to protect them, simply because the nobles were born with strong traits and nothing more. Mental conditioning was strong in this one, though he wasn&#39;t ruled by it.

<font color = white>&#34;I do, too... Just don&#39;t push yourselves too much, hard work is fine until you pull a muscle. It happens to everyone eventually.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) nimbly steps backward, putting some space between herself and the blonde.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Interesting...

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Though it isn't necessary for some techniques, the formation of handseals knead chakra into various natures-- the sequence creates the techniques.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: ...Is that sufficient, sir?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) turned his gaze from the three, almost dismissing them all, untill the gloomy one surprises him with a half answer. 

<font color = white>&#34;Half right Miss?. . .&#34;</font>

He paused to give her time to give her name, before continueing

<font color = white>&#34;Anyone else want to try and answer my pop quiz? How do you utilize chakra? First to answer completely gets a prize.&#34;</font>

He took note of the gloomy girl, weather she gave a name or not. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Kurorama, sir. Ah, forgive me if the answer wasn't sufficient.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) starts to think that getting embarassed over not understanding chakra control will become a common occurance in the future.

<font color = white>&#34;You gave the cloesest to the right answer.&#34;</font>

He nodded to the girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;Chakra is essential to even the most basic technique; it is the moulding of the physical energy present in every cell of the body and the spiritual energy gained from exercise and experience. Most shinobi utilize handsigns to utlize proper techniques and guide your chakra.&#34;</font>

He gave an impromptu lesson on the very very basics. 

<font color = white>&#34;Come here, Kurorama.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (I'll give a sheet of chakra paper to the first person who makes me a profile. )

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninjaest ninja-HoboCat) approached the child, intent to beat her at her own game. That was his ninja way. Someone had to be humbled at-least once in a week.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) reached into his jacket and pulled free a small wad of Ryo, and a ticket with a note. The note simply said One Question Answered. Then he&#39;d pass them over to the girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Captain Akitaru, A jounin of the village and leader of the twelve shinobi guardians. Take care of this. You can give it away, should you choose to do so, but I trust someone smart like you will understand it&#39;s value.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) accepted both! Whether she recognised the name or not was hard to gauge however, but she remained respectfully court either way.

<font color = white>&#34;Understood, sir. I&#39;ll make certain the trade is worth its value if such a thing becomes necessary.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninjaest ninja-HoboCat) drew a set of dice and showed them. It didn't seem like the ninja was a man of many words.</font></font></font>

He paused, giving the children around him a brief look.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would walk towarfs the kage and would gently elbo bump him.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (same for me, goodnight everyone

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) climbs out, having been zoned all this time! <font color = white>&#34;Sure. Here I am!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) looked over to his side and then looked down at the smaller child who elbowed him. He&#39;d cock a brow before furrowing both of his brows. 

<font color = white>&#34;Is this the disrespect you show your hokage? To just elbow bump themwhen they are deep in thought?&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) turned to look towards the young girl casually make her way towards the lord Hokage and attempt to elbow bump him. A subtle shifting of himself and the single utilizeation of a handsign would place him betweem the pair in a flash of smoke, preventing her from doing so. 

<font color = white>&#34;Please show proper decorum when addressing and getting close to the lord hokage.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (ah, you beat me too it, I wasn't gonna let her actually touch you )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) parted with a gentle sigh, the girl just wasn&#39;t getting it...! A hand raised, pressing to her chest respectfully.

<font color = white>&#34;Please forgive her doofy nature, Captain Akitaru. She&#39;s not quite accustomed. As said my name is Kurorama, of the Senju. My goal is to become a valuable asset of the village-- a pillar that strives to keep the Will of Fire burning. And, one day, if I may be so bold, I would wish to hold office as the Hokage.&#34;</font>

Sssspeeeaaaking of, said Kage had just appeared. Oh no, this was quite the audience.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would side eye the senju as he wanted to stand inbtween the duo.The girl would burst into laughter.

<font color = white>&#34;Geesh I see you&#39;re going with the dull kage huh?Come on,I know you like to have a bit of fun.&#34;</font>they would nudgethe hokage once more again.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) Huh. Wait. Captain?! Oh-- This guy. This guy must be someone important. Whoops!

She straightened her posture and stood at attention-- wait. He was no longer standing here. He was.. down the road now?! Fast. Well, for now, she just continued standing stiff as a wooden plank, not saying a word! Observing the events play out. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) didn&#39;t even blink, as the girl attempted to once more touch the hokage, he moved swiftly, grabbing her by the shoulder and waist and, almost artisticly, tossing her over the wall into the water. His face remained impartial and stoic, never once betraying emotion. His voice was much the same as he spoke. 

<font color = white>&#34;You will not be warned a third time. Do not attempt to touch the lord Hokage without his express consent.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) nods eight times in the span of one second. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would sigh at the senju as they some how became the voice for the kage.

<font color = white>&#34;Since your hand is there mind giving me a rub?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) showed a smirk as he turned to the two. 

<font color = white>&#34;Ah.. its okay, they are young afterall. Not many know the correct ways of decorum when addressing their superious. It will need to be taught in the academy.&#34;</font> The man slightly tilted his head back as his chin was raised, lowering his gaze onto the young Uchiha more. 

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me child, what is your name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) removed himself from the situation at that point, the lord Hokage now had this handled. His job had been completed in a manner approptiate his station. 

<font color = white>&#34;Of course, Lord Hokage&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) parted with a quiet &#39;Hemm&#39;, and tried to nudge the blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Introduce yourself.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would frown once seeing that the older senju didn&#39;t bless her with an awsome back rub.

<font color = white>&#34;My name is Senju Kumirama,pleasure to meet you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) had exactly zero refined etiquette skills. Naturally. She&#39;s has yet to even enter the Academy. Addressing individuals of note was beyond her limited skill range. But! She was able to follow helpful instructions, at the very least. 

A nudge and direction was just what she needed!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Hanako. I&#39;m, uh.. planning to join the Academy soon? Your.. <i>Captainship</i>?&#34;</font> She strained the last word together, having zero idea how to work with titles beyond what she&#39;s seen in novels about Lords. Surely that&#39;s how all titles worked, right? Lord equals Lordship! 

<font color = white>&#34;I, uh, look forward to learning!&#34;</font> She folds her hands at her waist and gauged their expression. Searching for any tells that she&#39;s scuffed up this introduction! </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcccc>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) nodded his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Interesting, I mistook you for an Uchiha. Your clans seem to have more and more similiar features with every passing generation. Noted. Senju Kumirama, ill be sure to have the Academy Sensei properly train you in your decorum.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d sigh as he looked up to the sky. <font color = white>&#34;Anyways,  I Should be off, the  hour is late and I am sure that we will have a very busy day tomorrow.&#34;</font> The Kaguya paused as he looked toward the older Senju. 

<font color = white>&#34;Captain, please be sure that this one specifically is made an example of infront of the class. I will not have soldier in Konoha&#39;s army that do not know proper decorum. Those who lack decorum, lack discpline, those who lack discpline do not follow orders, those who do not follow orders get their comrades killed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Koppun(The hokage-Taigodwushu) OOCs: (im checking out to rest. been at it for a long while now
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) regarded Hanako for a short while. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am the lead jounin of the village, and Commander of the twelve Guardians, Senju, Akitaru. You may Address me as Commander Senju or Akitaru Sensei, whichever you prefer.&#34;</font>

He nodded to the girl and the other senju standing beside her, giving them both a chance to say something in response. His head turned to bow towards the Hokage and nod. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll let the teachers know. Thank you for her oppertunity to learn, Lord Hokage.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Welp...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) skips away.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) can be seen walking towards the bridge while counting a wad of ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm....Oh cool glasses.....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was crossing the bridge when he spotted the gambler, a smile appearing on his face at the compliment. <font color = white>&#34;Thanks!&#34;</font> He didn&#39;t know how to properly answer that, but still managed a compliment back as well. <font color = white>&#34;Nice robes, they suit you well.&#34;</font>

Then he remembered she was there when the Captain had showed up when they were around the ramen stall. <font color = white>&#34;By the way, now that I think about it, I never caught your name. I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> He approaches the girl and offers her a fist bump.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would look at the Uchiha weird as he begin to walk closer to her.Just in case this person was crazy she would tuck her ryo into her bra causing the twins to jiggle a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;Riiiiiiight.......Um it&#39;s cus I never told you my name.&#34;</font>she said while blushing at the boy<font color = white>&#34;Care to play a game for rock papper scissors?If you win i&#39;ll tell you my name,but if I win.....Hmm..&#34;</font>the gambler would size the teen up and down<font color = white>&#34;How about I get your shade?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) retracts his fist upon receiving no fist bump. Was she the more formal kind?

Resisting the urge to say that much was obvious to her first sentence, he simply crossed his arms as she suggested a game for them to play. <font color = white>&#34;Hmmm... so your name is that valuable huh?&#34;</font>

With a smile on his face he agreed. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, that sounds good, rock paper scissors. I like those odds.&#34;</font> He was confident when it came to his luck, although he shouldn&#39;t, it was terrible. He didn&#39;t want to lose his shades but this sounded too fun to pass up on.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) begins to laugh at her brother&#39;s underling as she would prepare her first battle of the art of rock papper scissors.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s duel!&#34;</font>she scream as she begin to shake her hand to confuse the Uchiha.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kumirama(The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) OOCs: (1 beats 2,2 beats 3, 3 beats 1

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (as expected
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was still smiling in confidence even as the girl began to shake her hand. He instantly began to imitate her, and to be honest, there was no process to his thoughts, this was simply about luck.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;</font> Throwing his hand out at the same time as her, he had chosen to paper! His confidence, however, was instantly shattered when he saw she had chosen scissors.

And he theatrically fell to his knees, defeated! <font color = white>&#34;Noooo.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) 
A dark cloud would appear behind the gambler as she begin to laugh maliciously

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s mine!IT&#39;S ALL MINE!&#34;</font>she said as she reach towards the boy&#39;s shades.The clouds would now turn to thunder clouds once putting the glasses on.

<font color = white>&#34;So tell me do I look cool?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) looked up at the girl as his shades were snatched. As dark clouds gathered behind her and thunder struck in the distance, she looked truly evil! Still, he couldn&#39;t lose hope!

The Uchiha jumped to his feet. <font color = white>&#34;I admit it, you look amazing with those.&#34;</font> She really did, stylish, nice. <font color = white>&#34;But I can&#39;t simply let you walk away with those shades! I challenge for a rematch.&#34;</font>

After declaring his intent, he revealed what he would bet this turn. <font color = white>&#34;If you win, I will give you my Clan Jacket.&#34;</font> It had the symbol of the Uchiha on it, and it was pretty valuable, at least in his eyes. <font color = white>&#34;If I win, you give me back my shades AND tell me your name.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;What say you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (btw, i noticed you called Shishorama 'brother', pretty sure he's a girl actually

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would pat the Uchiha&#39;s head while laughing which caused her boobs to shake bit.

<font color = white>&#34;There There!I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t know my name after being my brother&#39;s underling.&#34;</font>its clear that the girl wasn&#39;t trying to return the shades she won<font color = white>&#34;Deal but i&#39;ll need something in return.If I win you have to walk around in a dress.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: I mean sister.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Sometimes they can be super strong and I forget they/'re a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: But you didn't hear that from me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) turned red when he received that pat to the head, he didn&#39;t even notice her boobs, it still made them embarassed and a bit ashamed though. <font color = white>&#34;First of all, I am no one&#39;s Underling! I could definitely beat your Brothe-I mean Sister, yeah.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And it seems my jacket is not enough for you and you want something more extreme. I&#39;m not gonna lie, this doesn&#39;t sound like a fair bet at all.&#34;</font> Would he take it though, well, if he&#39;s anything... it&#39;s overconfident. He had already lost once, it meant he had higher chances of winning this time.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, I accept, but why would you even want me to go around in a dress? Are you one of those who just likes humiliating others?&#34;</font> Scrunching up his nose, he began to nervously tap his foot on the ground, damn, he didn&#39;t wanna go around in a dress.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hmm....
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: You're right.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) felt a wave of excitement rushing through his body, a small blush coming to his cheeks as he barely contained a bright smile. <font color = white>&#34;Hahahaha!&#34;</font> With a hearty laugh, the previous dark thuner cloud quickly drifted away from the sky as the sun began to shine behind him as if to say it had been watching that and it was proud of the boy.

With that done, he snatched his shades back. <font color = white>&#34;Back where they belong! Now then...&#34;</font> He waited for the girl to introduce herself.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would fall to her knees as the shades were snatched from her.

<font color = white>&#34;Nooo!I guess the gods blessed you this time.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Care to go again?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Samething.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: If I win I get the shades again and if you win you get my name.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Hm... seems like we'll keep going at this for a while, but it sounds good to me.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: GUUUUH!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) stood tall and proud. The girl had now learned, he only knew how to play paper.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would look gloomy as she was beaten by the Uchiha.

<font color = white>&#34;Fiiiine....my name is Senju Kumirama.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: A deal is a deal.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Kinda wonder what sort of bets you're gonna come up during our academy year. I'll be looking forward to it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) a single tear fell down their face as they lost their chance of getting cool shades.

<font color = white>&#34;You think so?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Yea!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: There's a guy there.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: He's been just looking off in the distance.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) felt no pity as she shed a tear. It was a shame, but these shades are his. <font color = white>&#34;Trust me, I never lie.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And yeah, there is a guy there.&#34;</font> He turns to face that masked boy.<font color = white>&#34; Raising a hand, he waved at them. &#34;</font>Hey! What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Hm... they must be daydreaming.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello.&#34;</font> He stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Pleasure to meet ya.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: You as well.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Nice to meet you! Everything okay? You just been standing there for a while.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: It seems I was lost, then I froze.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: It's a animal instict when you are scared.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Are you scared?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: MWAHAHAHA!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Terrified.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Did you need to cross the bridge?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) gave a glance toward the crimson eyed gambler, noticing them getting closer as he took a few steps back, Keeping his distance.


<font color = white>&#34;Bridge?&#34;</font> He questioned before looking in the distance, noticing it before shaking his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Nope.&#34;</font> He stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) throws a pokeball at the teen hoping that she'll capture her a rare one.In reality it was just a balled up paper which said freeze.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watched the interaction with curiosity, the girl sure was an eccentric one. <font color = white>&#34;Welll...&#34;</font> He watched the paper ball sail through the air towards the dark haired boy. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re still lost, need help getting somewhere? Are you going to take part in the academy as well?&#34;</font>

He aassumed that last part due to their attire, some people like to dress the part, and he found that to be pretty cool.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Yea we can help ya.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: You seem cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, noticing the paper ball coming towards him, wacking him in the side of his face with no reaction. He blinked once, reaching down for the paper ball before tossing it back towards the crimon eyed gambler.

<font color = white>&#34;I...I am a bit lost and my parents told me to go to the...&#34;</font> He mumbled off thinking about it. <font color = white>&#34;The academy...&#34;</font> He stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) tried to run away from the pokeball,but adly she was captured.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh?I&#39;m Kumirama,it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.Did your parents fill out the paper work for you to join?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) approached the boy rather than just standing to the side. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s always nice to meet a new classmate. I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> Then he offered the kid a fistbump.

<font color = white>&#34;We can take you to the academy, but yeah, you need the paperwork filledo ut. Should&#39;ve gotten to your household through mail.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: KURIRAMA IS DATING MY CHILDHOOD FRIEND!?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) glanced down at Yuuto&#39;s hand, raising his fist and connected the fist bump before rubbing the back of his head yawning.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you both, I&#39;m Kaito.&#34;</font> He stated before the looking at the sky. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah...sadly I am going to the academy.&#34;</font> He mumbled.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would give the child a thumbs up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Positive would be me sleeping.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Is this your way of asking for a slumber party?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: We should all just sleep.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Kumirama*
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) asks: What is a slumber party?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) looked at the piece of paper that Kaito held but then his sights went towards small pebble on the ground. Okay, he could throw it pretty far... picking it up, he looked at the direction Shishorama was in and just tossed it while aiming at her. He was very likely to miss, but could at the very least make her realize he had seen her. <font color = white>&#34;She&#39;s so loud.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wait... you two missed the first day of class? I can fill you in on what happened if you&#39;re both curious. I took part in most of it. I got the gist of what it was about.&#34;</font> If they were willing to hear, he was up for a rather extensive explanation of what happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Oh?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hey, Kumirama!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: A slumber party is a sleep over.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Guess what!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) looks over at the strong girl on top of the building.

<font color = white>&#34;How did she even get up there?See.....i&#39;m convinced she has something supernatural about her.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) a single glance went toward the intense youngster before he looked back at Yuuto, the words processing in his head for a second before he quickly shook it and covered his ears, not wanting to listen to any lesson.

<font color = white>&#34;No...Don&#39;t do it..&#34;</font>He mumbled.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: But what happened!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Huh? What's going on?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Not sure, trying to explain what went on in class yesterday.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Oh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) smiled as she clambered down the building. Alas, she topples down to the cobblestone floor below. <font color = white>&#34;I got in a fight!&#34;</font> She roars as she lifts herself from the ground, unphased and unharmed.

<font color = white>&#34;I got in a fight and it was fun!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) heard the small mumble from the dark haired boy, and saw him shaking his head. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you only have to gain from listening to this kid. Trust me, it&#39;s not that bad.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;We just saw the Hokage Manor and the Fire Monument with some explanations from the teacher. Then we had to climb a mountain, the exercise had us helping each other.&#34;</font> They had formed a system pretty easily. <font color = white>&#34;We just made a system to help get everyone to the top, helping pull and throw people upwards.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t terrible.

<font color = white>&#34;Somethings will be easier by just relying on your classmates like that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) nodded his head a few times, pretending to listen to Yuuto as he kept his hands on his ears, blocking out all the noise, when he seemed like he was done talking he lowered his hands.

<font color = white>&#34;Wowwww...Sounds cool.&#34;</font> he stated, raising a hand to block his yawn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would scratch their head while looking at their sister wonder why she was in the streets fighting people.,but either way she was proud of her super buff sister.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah!I&#39;ll have to treat you out for some pork buns later then.....wait.&#34;</font>the gambler would wrap their arm around the Uchiha<font color = white>&#34;Heeey Yuuto wanna treat my sister and myself to some pork buns?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Paled orbs bounce from the group to the one who had just abruptly collided with the ground, clearly lacking the skill to land like a shinobi would. Her arms crossed, canting her visage ever so slightly to one side, <font color = white>&#34;Top of the academy, but landing like that... Hmh.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Was the fight with that red-haired boy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yeah, Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Dog..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Treat us to some pork buns!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was listening to everyone and was about to answer Kumirama until he noticed a familiar sigh. His hand was instantly raised and pointed at the dog. <b><font color = white>&#34;You!&#34;</font></b>

The lost dog, this time he was going to catch it! He charged at it! That 50 ryo bounty was his!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) ignores the loudness. <font color = white>&#34;Good morning. Most in the arena have fallen to the lull of sleep.&#34;</font>

She idly watched the dog, surely this could be entertaining if nothing else.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) did no move a muscle, it merely tilted its head to the side in confusion as the overconfident kid charged at it. With a dumb look on its face as he pants joyfully.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Is that your dog?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Hmm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) got in front of the dog and instantly tried to swipe the dog from the ground as gently as he could, because he obviously didn&#39;t want to hurt it. He just needed to catch it and return it to an old lady as far as he remembers.

<font color = white>&#34;No, not my dog, he&#39;s wanted though! He&#39;s Miss Kome&#39;s missing dog, apparently he goes missing every week. It was on the newspaper. Me and some others tried to catch him last night but we failed.&#34;</font> He didn&#39;t expect him to be caught this easily.

Yuuto had been sure this dog was the most elusive creature ever until now.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, noticing everyone&#39;s focus was on something else, a small smirk formed under his mask. First he took a few steps back then if no one noticed his getaway it turned into a full blown sprint somewhere he could take a nap.

<font color = white>&#34;Wow...what a cool looking dog...&#34;</font> he mumbled...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) gets her pokeball ready.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Oh, get him!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Powerful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) froze in place, he felt a scary presence behind him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) rushes toward the dog in a manic fashion, clearly intent on having fun moreso than actually capturing it. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (yo dogmin, love your icon
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Looks like you found the dog, huh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) shrugged as she would similarly make her way over, arms crossed behind her back as she drew nearer and nearer. Caution was stuck to her features, as she didn&#39;t quite want to touch a random dog. That would get her hands and attire dirty - or worse... catching something from it.

<font color = white>&#34;It looks like it bites.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) was picked up without no issue. It seemed pretty dumb, just looking at all the new faces he has never seen before with clueless stares. Even with the intense youngster rushing at it, the dog seemed to have no common sense or any feel for potential danger... Or what it that confident in it's own abilities...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) yells: Urrrf!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: That thing is gonna bite you, Yuuto.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) <font color = white>&#34;Let me see the dog!&#34;</font> Shisorama demands as she attempts to rip the poor thing from Yuuto&#39;s grasp. <font color = white>&#34;I want to hold him!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) found this to be incredibly easy... either way, one thing was certain. <font color = white>&#34;So fluffy!&#34;</font> He wanted to squeeze this dog in a hug, but didn&#39;t want to hurt him. <font color = white>&#34;Let him bite me then, look at him! It would be worth it.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Nope, you can&#39;t hold him.&#34;</font> He told Shishorama. <font color = white>&#34;I caught him, try next week.&#34;</font> She should know by now she was not stronger than him, even if she tried to get the dog from his grasp, his arms simply wouldn&#39;t budge.

<font color = white>&#34;Now... Kohaku, any clue where we take this thing. I can get the bounty and treat all of us for some pork buns.&#34;</font> He nodded at Kumirama, he would get her those pork buns she seemed to want.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) was like a motionless doll as the two bickered for him. Clearly, he wasn't fighting it at all.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) rested her hands behind her head, watching this scene, unfortunately it was no where near as entertaining as she had hoped.. such is life it seems.

<font color = white>&#34;What a calm dog..&#34;</font> She observed the fluffy mass, perhaps it was only waiting for the right time?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) continues to wave at the dog, he was just happy to be there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) rubbed the side of his cheek as he watched Shishorama be herself, acting before thinking in the situation. At least this one did&#39;t seem to endanger anyone, just a puppy with a lack of survival instincts. As for  where to take the dog really?

He&#39;d shrug, <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know- The lady&#39;s house probably, at least that&#39;s what common sense dictate but i don&#39;t know where she even lives.&#34;</font> The younger Uchiha admitted, he was actually looking around through the town to get a read of the other areas outside the Uchiha Compound.

He&#39;s at least foud everything of importance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) fell asleep, snoring every once in a while.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) already felt regret at the thought of returning this dog... but he can't keep it... he can't.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So cute..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) would take a few steps nearer, squinting at the dog as she inspects it for visible signs of rabies or something. She heard every animal you see running around has that, and it&#39;s not pleasant.

<font color = white>&#34;Then it looks like you have a new pet for now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tried and tried to get Yuuto budge. He was stronger, sure, but he wasn&#39;t so much stronger that she couldn&#39;t budge him at all. She only two letter grades away!  <font color = white>&#34;Come on! Let me hold him!&#34;</font> She complains loudly.

If something didn&#39;t give, physical violence might be the only option.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) skips her way down the bridge&#39;s guard rail, using it as a gymnast would a balance-beam. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hmm, hum, ha-hum, hm, hm-- hm??&#34;</font> 

She noticed a collective of dog admirers beyond the end. And-- <font color = white>&#34;Hey! You guys found the always-runs-away pooch! Cool beans.&#34;</font> A hop sends her back to solid ground. She posts up in the general vicinity, deciding it best to keep her distance. Animals hated being crowded. Right? Right. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: You're gonna break the dog...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm not!
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) asks: Can..I pet him...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It didn't even try to run away.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just let him take a swim. He'll be fine after.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: You should bathe it.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I don't think it would stop you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) That was true, but damn was she stubborn! <font color = white>&#34;You know I would&#39;ve actually let you hold the dog if you simply asked nicely, right?&#34;</font> He just squinted at the girl as his arms actually began to budge.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s sleeping right now, when he wakes up, I&#39;ll let you, now stop yelling, Shishorama.&#34;</font> Now he had to treat her like she was a younger kid. <font color = white>&#34;You can hold him before we find the old lady or when he wakes up, until then,, calm down.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And yeah, Hanako, wanna help us go look for the owner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) shuffles his feet toward the sleeping dog, intent on petting it's fluffy head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) immediately relents and allows her arms to flop lifelessely at her side. <font color = white>&#34;Can I please hold him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So soft..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Is Senju, Kumirama among you guys?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's my sister!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Kumirama, Komo-sense is calling for you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was alive to witness this historical moment. Shishorama actually relented. She gave up on something, he had convinced her to step down. <font color = white>&#34;See? Was that so hard?&#34;</font> With that said, he gently slid the dog onto her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Sensei. We found the dog, where do we take him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I didn't even know you had a sister...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Sure. I'm the forty-first best person in the village at finding dog owners. I'll lend you my skills.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Oh. Give it here, I'll give him back to Miss Korme.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I haven't seen my sister at all.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Alright, Shishorama, hand the dog over to Sensei, then we can go for some pork buns.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hm. My skills say Sensei will handle the rest. Mission accomplished.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Good job, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I did my best! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah, here's the other half of the academy.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Yes, Batsu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) was a polite young woman at her core. She had no need to be violent against her friends unless absolutely necessary. To ask and use manners was not beneath her. 

<font color = white>&#34;Nice!&#34;</font> She says as she takes hold of the big fluffy boy. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s so fluffy!&#34;</font> She shrieks in excitement before handing the pup to the Sensei. <font color = white>&#34;Here you go, Sensei. Yuuto was able to grab him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Farewell...doggy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i love this dog icon
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (looks a lot like my dog irl)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Were you at the lesson?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) asks: We had a lesson already?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I had a supervised spar today Sensei! I did you proud!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: You mean the rock climbing?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) had no idea if Komo would actually be proud or not. She just assumed that would be the case.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It wwas mainly a team work exercise.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Well, how did you do?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I was carried up, sadly my strength didn't do much for climbing. I helped pull people up once there with a group.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) picked up the pup with her lazed eyes gazed upon the creature. It seem like she was all to used to this puppy, clearly did not have the same effects of its presence effecting her at all.

The puppy seemed familar with the Chuunin, easily hopping into her hands and climbing on top of her head as if it was one of its hangout places.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, Ko... Time for you to go back home.&#34;</font> She said, digging into her pocket and handing the &#39;bounty&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see. Unfortunate but shows true teamwork.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would clear their throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Soooo Yuuta what about those pork buns.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tossed the money to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, <font color = white>&#34;I hope we deal more with Chakra next lesson, while my Physical Strength isn&#39;t anything too special I can make that up with my chakra control.&#34;</font>

He was more than sure of that.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: We shall see.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: There goes that word again. Chakra...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) nodded at the dog, bidding it goodbye with a final pet. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we should go for those pork buns now-&#34;</font> Then he caught the money tossed his way. <font color = white>&#34;My treat! Let&#39;s go?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Kibo, you don't know what chakra is?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...Makes sense for him.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Heeey there, Maya. Who's your friend?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yup! Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh? No idea.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I think it's more becase we are from a clan, yes... It's an energy Shinobi use for Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, and even enhancing Taijutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: An unknown friend. I see, I see.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) approaches with pocketed hands...!

He briefly hesitates, but eventually nods a couple of times.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know what it is, no. Am I supposed to?&#34;</font> He questions, while taking steps forth.

He raises a hand to high five Hanako as he walks past.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, friend..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Where is the weapon shop?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It can be morhed into a physical shape if you train hard enough, too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Friend. Make yourself known! Oh-- hi, other friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I've been demoted from friend to other friend, it seems.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) plops his bottom onto the wooden bench, kicking his feet along.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hajime of the twenty ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: So it's energy, right? What's it look like?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Ah.. we my introductions missed previously..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) moves along with puppy in head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How goes your day?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It's going well! I just learned another piece of key knowledge that I need to beat the clans at their own game. This Chakra stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ha ha! Of course not. I miss nothing. Ever.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It's kind of bright, and blue-ish.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) missed a lot. All the time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) held a hand to her forehead for a moment, with a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Okiku. I was walking around the academy stuff with you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ohh..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I remember that!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Certainly..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) barely remembers what she had for breakfast this morning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah yes, this is Okiku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wwould make a flame between his hands to demonstrate, <font color = white>&#34;My Chakra takes on the properties of fire like all of the Uchiha- It&#39;s used to use Katon based Ninjutsu.&#34;</font> He stated before putting the flame out, the demonstration was simple but more effective than his explainations of it as a whole.

<font color = white>&#34;It basically runs through all of us, taking different forms based on the individual or in some cases the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hello, Okiku.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Fire...?!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Yes!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) started make his way past the bridge with his friends. <font color = white>&#34;So, I don&#39;t really know any other restaurant or anything, but I love this place!&#34;</font> As soon as he plopped down on his seat, he could see the Chef already with a smirk on his face. He was always quick with a tip and an upbeat attitude after all.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Chef! Send three servings of pork buns our way! And whatever else these two may want. Some orange juice too.&#34;</font> And with that, they would wait.

<font color = white>&#34;It feels a bit strange to just pay for your food though.&#34;</font> He glances at Kumirama for a smirk. <font color = white>&#34;Maybe next time I should make you a bet for it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yakeru!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Join us, Yuuto's treating.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Hey, nice to meet you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would take some of the pork bun and would do a little dance because the food was oh so good.

<font color = white>&#34;Yuuuummmm&#34;</font>the girl would begin to blush as she continued to munch on the bun.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) smiled while waving to the trio.

<font color = white>&#34;H-hey guys.&#34;</font> he said before taking his seat.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) giggled at the little dance done by Kumirama before taking up a pork bun served to him. Delicious~! His expression instantly brightened at the warmth that spread through his body in this rather cold day.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Chef, another serving of pork buns.&#34;</font> Tapping his chopsticks, he pointed at Yakeru. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto by the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) waited for her food, kicking her legs around aimlessly while sitting on the stool.  After the food finally came, she obliterated the lot of it within seconds, not taking a single second to actually enjoy the taste. She was quite hungry after being busy all day long.

<font color = white>&#34;Mmmmhmmm! This is good stuff! Good idea convincing Yuuto to come here, Kumirama!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Don't forget Yakeru, Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -Oh, he's already getting food.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Must've missed you ordering it.~
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Laro!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Join!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (brb)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (I hunger irl)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) walks by the village with his hands tucked in his pockets, noticing a familiar voice calling out to him. Turning around, he&#39;d notice Shishorama at the ramen shop along with a few other students. Slowly, he&#39;d join up with them.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys. What are you eating? It sure smells nice. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) would place some change on the table, ordering their fill.

<font color = white>&#34;Pork b-buns please.&#34;</font> he said with a nod, they&#39;d then look over his shoulder, smiling to the one who introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nice to meet you, I&#39;m Sarutobi, Yakeru.&#34;</font> he&#39;d introduce himself with a weak smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Nice to meet you Yakeru.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) wets his lips as he sees Yakeru&#39;s food arrive. It sure got him hungry in an instant. Placing his hand in his pocket, he&#39;d get his money pouch, only to open it and see -- there was nothing inside, or rather not enough Ryo to get a proper meal.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh. &#34;</font> he mumbled to himself dissapointed, before returning the pouch back into his pocket.

<font color = white>&#34;You know what, nothing for me please, I&#39;ll just hang out. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d say to the shopkeepers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Have you guys already figured out what path you'll take on your journey?
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) asks: It's nice to meet you too... Uh.. What's your name?
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: My name is Laro.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Heya Yuuto.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) yells: Well, Laro. It's n-nice to meet you pal!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Can we get something else?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was just enjoying the pork buns through their time here. He had barely noticed the moment Laro arrived, another person to introduce himself. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, nice to meet you, Laro. I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;You sure you don&#39;t want anything? It&#39;s my treat.&#34;</font> He said that without really waiting for an answer. <font color = white>&#34;Hey chef, another serving for our buddy Laro there.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Sure, I still got some more money from the bounty. What should we get this time Kumirama?&#34;</font> Thankfully, as a street stall of sorts, this place&#39;s prices were rather cheap, and the food quality was still great.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would clear their throat as she slips the uchiha a list of food she wanted.The list contained three order of seaweed salad,ten chicken wings and some green tea ice cream.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) flops over the guard rail, entirely lacking in grace, and sploshed into the river. 

A minute later, she emerged, blowing on the recovered bill, trying and failing to air-dry it. A soggy set of sandal-prints were left in her trail as she made her way back to Position A! Lurking beneath the street light. 

Drenched, but the grin she wore says she's elated by her mission accomplished. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) had to hold back a laughter. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you&#39;re quite the glutton, arin&#39;t you?&#34;</font> That would really burn a hole through his pockets. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, but next time we&#39;re out eating, it&#39;s your treat, sounds fair?&#34;</font> And he wouildn&#39;t have mercy on her.

The list of food was quite appealing, and he decided to order it just to try some of those things as well. Thankfully, even if he ran out of the bounty money, he still had some pocket money as well since despite his relationship with his family, he&#39;s still an Uchiha.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Chef, serve these over here, please!&#34;</font> Sliding the paper to the cook, he just waited a little bit before food started being served, each one with a smell more appetizing than the one before it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s eyes lit up as Yuuto ordered food for him. A small gesture, but had a great effect. Forming a smile on his face, his eyes slightly getting teary, he&#39;d down a nod to the Uchiha boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you Yuuto, I owe you one. &#34;</font>

After a while another ration of pork buns would arrive, letting the smell fill out the area. He&#39;d quickly dig into his food.

<font color = white>&#34;Mhmm this is woo gwood. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d talk with his mouth full.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Back!)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hey! Laro!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Hey Shisho.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Eating well?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You should spar with Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Oh no, not again.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You two are more each others speed!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) would walk up to where a lot of people were..

<font color = white>&#34;So this is where everyone went!&#34;</font> She would say as she munched on a strawberry mochi!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would munch on his food, now properly swallowing it before he talked. He&#39;d also look down the table at everyone who sat around.

<font color = white>&#34;Did you guys figure out what you want to do as shinobi? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Taijutsu!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would sway side to side as she watched her food be made.This caused the girl to begin to blush as sweat can also be seen dripping from her face<font color = white>&#34;Looks....looks soooo good.&#34;</font>The first thing Kumi would dive into would be the wings.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...it&#39;s soooo crispy too!I can kiss this cook!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) shook his head,

<font color = white>&#34;Not really, I kind of want to do it all....&#34;</font> he said nervously looking around, he knew how foolish it might sound aloud.

<font color = white>&#34;A generalist...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Kumirama.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Howdy?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Ku-
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: She didn't do it, I swear!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I've been with her the entire time!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks:  Ooo~ Someone's in trouble?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: If anyone say I stole their money they're lying!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: I won it!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yeah, she has an addiction!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked at the crowd. Ignoring all the other statements being said.

<font color = white>&#34;Kumirama, I need you to come with me.&#34;</font> She eerily smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Can I go? She's my sister!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) puts down the food as he slowly turns around.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh, busted big time. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d mumble under his breath. But then it hit him. They were all noble clans so it would probably look quite bad on them, whatever it was. Him? He was nothing special. 

So he decided to step forward.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Chuunin, it was me. It wasn&#39;t Kumirama. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: I'm equally responsible for her actions..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Well... I'll save some food for you Kumirama. Good luck. We'll be waiting here.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Oh? I wasn't told about anything, I just wanted to reward Kumirama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) gulped.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh boy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) was about to run away,but an invisible force would cause her to trip.

<font color = white>&#34;Ugh....I guess it&#39;s a sign for me to come....Can I take my food with me?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn't think he could argue against a Chuunin when he didn't even know what this was about-And hey! It was about a reward!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Oh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh of relief.

<font color = white>&#34;Back to my food it is then. &#34;</font>

He&#39;d instantly dart towards the pork buns. not letting them get cold. Almost as if he had the Flying Raijin. &#34;</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Go ahead, take your food.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Bye, Kumi!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would take wings,but would leave the rest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) had a scared expression on her face as she turned to her sister.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Are you all set to recieve your reward?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Lead the way my good sir.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Fight?! Choking...?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) a single weak hand raised towards her chest as she began to pound it with a closed fist whilst being dragged away by Hanako.

It was indeed a pin bone that she had swallowed, a sharp end had lodged itself within the base of her esophagus and needed to be dislodged.

However she was too weak to dislodge it herself, causing each weak dull thump to just cause her to choke loudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I will need you for a demonstration later today.
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) thinks: Oh my god..are they gonna drown me.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Have an extra set of clothes.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Was this about the kage thingy?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: I promise.....I was just joking with him.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Wanted to see if he had luck on his side.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Please don't drown me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) nods her head. Infact she seem more annoying having to deal with it than she initiately expressed.
  Her grin lowered as she swatted down.

<font color = white>&#34;Look. I was ordered to do something about it, and I will. I must carry it out, however my conscience won&#39;t allow me to let a child drown. So, don&#39;t worry about it.

You must understand that some people we work with will not take kindly to casual banter as the rest of us. Just do your best to endure it, yeah?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would tug on the chunin&#39;s vest.

<font color = white>&#34;Please I can only hold my breath for five seconds.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Move around your arms.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: You did nothing to offend me. If you're truly sorry, you wouldn't do what you did again..
<br><font color=teal>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) whispers: In all honestly, it seemed very minor to me. But keep that a secret.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: I just nudged the kage.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Yeah.. Well, maybe.
<br><font color=teal>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) whispers: He's just scared of your power.
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) whispers: W-what?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) gave a child a wink before patting her on the shoulder.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: And it's a good time to learn how to swim.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would fear for their life as they belived it was their last days on Earth.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: I guess I should start now huh?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Just move around your arms like you're trying to push the water underneath ya.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Nah, not yet. I'll have something in mind.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Each time you say something my fear level increases.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: You're dismissed, but I expect you to be attending the next class.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Yeah, it's a natural gift of mine.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah...

<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Maybe you will stop throwing paper balls.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: It's because I nudge the kage!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: And old geezer is holding a grudge?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You did what?!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: ...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would grip Shish shirt.

<font color = white>&#34;I can only hold my breath for five seconds.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Well, you aren't drowned right -now-, sothere's that...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between them.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Mm?
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: Sounds... Risky.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) scratches his chin as he thinks to himself.

<font color = white>&#34;I got it. We can draw some mustaches on some picture or a poster. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Right!
