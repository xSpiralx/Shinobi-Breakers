<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) wanders into what should be described as a square of sorts.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey.&#34;</font> He greeted the group already there before moving his hands into his pockets.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckled once more as more and more people came to be around.
<font color = white>&#34;Hello, everyone. Nice to see more people around again.
I wonder, though, if the Hyuuga Clan Head will be around, soon, as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) is found staring at the sky, arms across his chest. The voice of the approaching boy snaps him to attention. <font color = white>&#34;Oh... hey.&#34;</font> 
He then looks to the stranger girl. <font color = white>&#34;Why, is there some sort of special occasion?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He gives the scrolls.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) shakes her head slowly, yet her smile would not fade.
Instead, her eyes would scan the two recently arrived.

A green-haired individual, and a black-haired one.
The Green-haired one seemed taller, more mature than herself, or even more-so than the other person.

As for the black-haired one, they seemed feminine, at least, to her.
<font color = white>&#34;Nothing too big should be happening, unless the Festival of Water has begun - But I think it has yet to begin... I believe. As for other activities, it would be the academy.&#34;</font>

The girl moved a hand through her hair before continuing.
<font color = white>&#34;Are you both students as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (hanamura,where did you got that profile code?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (A friend. ^^ Why?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i might need it XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (wondering if it will prevent that discord annoyance of changing their link every couple of days
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) turned to his side, looking at the green-haired male before looking around some more, noticing the shark-boy as well.
He'd raise his hand in greeting towards them, a light smirk visable, before he'd listen to the girl some more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded his head, taking a bit of time to read the soft spoken person on the bench. He took note of the courteous smile, which caused him to stare for a bit too long, but then he quickly averted his gaze once their gazes met. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (The profile sadly won't accept Discord Pictures, hence why my first playby failed. But it should work with other sites' pictures, I think.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) got up from her seat, taking a position more centered on the group, rather than sticking to one side of it.
<font color = white>&#34;I do assume you&#39;re both students, as well? What about you?&#34;</font> She&#39;d ask, looking over to the Shark-like boy.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mmmm-hm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well...is nice to finally see more people.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I'm a student, yes. Yuki, Subaru. Pleasure.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...oh,explains your
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Feminine look
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) offered a nod in confirmation towards the lass, shifting his form to avoid a particularly annoying beam of sunlight breaking through the tree-leaves.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Nice to meet you too, Subaru. I am Hanamura.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked around, taking note of everyone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kusahara. Student.&#34;</font> He said briefly, but with a bit more volume in his voice this time so everyone could hear.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well Hanamura,is seems we found out  other students.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That's correct, yes. And I do hope more will come, as well. Even so, I am pleased to see more and more are waking up.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Either way, nice to meet you, as well, Kusahara.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded in response. <font color = white>&#34;And you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) let out a sharp wan, reclining back somewhat, the pale-skinned individual almost threatening to fall back onto the ground from his seated position. 
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, right. Introductions, uh... Hello. I&#39;m Saigosame. Of the Hoshigaki clan. Just, you know, in case there was any doubt.&#34;</font>, he remarked, following with a brief chuckle at his own joke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Might I ask, have either of you decided on a goal or focus, yet? For myself, I like to train in Ninjutsu and Taijutsu. But I am also still open for learning other paths, of course. - And pleasure to meet you, Saigosame, as well.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nice to meet you all. Good to see a Hoshigaki about, and glad my eyes didn't fool me, heheh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) scratches the back of his head, smirking lightly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank stare to the question stated, looking back up at the sky to find some sort of sign or answer, finding none. In the end he just shrugged, looking at the others and listening to their answers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Ah, sorry, as far your question...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) yells: I suppose Ninjutsu, yes. Maybe some additions for self-defense in close-combat could be great!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: We have one blacksmith and one future medic besides her
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Cool, well, medics are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah,medics and blacksmiths are more uncommon aswell.

<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, if any of you have questions, or need anything, feel free to ask. -- Then again, I'm sure we're all on equal level, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: After what ive seen from you Hanamura? Im unsure,atleast for myself
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) noticably entered a thoughtscape that painted his expression a bit grim, but it faded in a few moments, possibly snapped out of it by Hanamura. <font color = white>&#34;I wonder about that.&#34;</font> He would respond to her assumption. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) clapped his hands together.
<font color = white>&#34;You know what? This place needs a map. It&#39;s like a maze, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I agree.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its fine.Perhaps you guys need to go out more
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It can be confusing, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can easily remember it.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Exploring does help.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Be back soon a moment, sorry.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looks at Saigosame with narrowed lips, and shrugs as if to say <font color = white>&#34;I guess it&#39;s just you and me.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I could do with some sightseeing later, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: But it shouldn't be too difficult to remember everything, heh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) took a glance back at Subaru, and let out a defeated sigh. Now as forever, the Yuki and the Hoshigaki were united.
<font color = white>&#34;Man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) noticed the Hoshigaki&#39;s glance, making him blink a couple times.
<font color = white>&#34;Something wrong?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (oh, i'm cooked, that was meant for kusahara. my bad. i misread the chat.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (No worries. xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Huh? No. I mistook you for Kusahara. Listen- I'm REALLY tired.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) closed his eyes and took a deep whiff of the chill dusk air. 
<font color = white>&#34;Getting late.&#34;</font> He muttered to himself. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) eyes Kusahara and then looks down his own form.
<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we do look similar.&#34;</font> He&#39;d jest before shrugging.
<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, all is fine, really.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: More like getting early if you ask me, though.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (i missed wipe start last time i played srp so i was getting catchup and shit, but this.....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Early, late... It's all good time for sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Sounds like you'll need a pillow on your desk at the Academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) said with a slight smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I guess everyone is traning?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If I sleep through the lessons I'll end up super-behind.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or you guys just study inside the academy only
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I'm not some sort of super-genius... You know?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not either,but is good to practice what you have learned.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shrugged once more. <font color = white>&#34;I study on my own, but nothing too serious.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns to acknowledge the newly arrived person.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I see...then,what do you want to do after the academy ends?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Has...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Has the academy even STARTED yet?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank look to that question. <font color = white>&#34;What does a bird want to do when it&#39;s no longer a chick? We are Shinobi, most of us here will be fighting and probably dying for the village.&#34;</font> He said plainly. <font color = white>&#34;Hopefully dying later than sooner...&#34;</font> he added in a low tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It did started.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It will end in a year.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And...not everyone is a fighter.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: It is why I said "most of us here."
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: True..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case..hopefully we meet each other thoughout the year and inside the battlefield.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded and tried to shake off the grimness of his words, almost as if they were not his own. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: By the way, did I not catch your name, or...?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yakushi,Najiro
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I am back.)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Future medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, sorry, I must have been deep in thought, I see we have another fellow student? Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded. <font color = white>&#34;Ah... so you&#39;ll be trying to keep us among the living.&#34;</font> He said with a soft smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked once again at the child in the kimono, who has not said a word since they arrived.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: More of keeping people who are worthy to live.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But yes,trying to keep people alive.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Noted.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I would say all lifes are worthy, really...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) pulled his sunhat over his eyes, mostly to avoid the glaring light of the streetlamp above him.
<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s a kinda weird way of looking at it, I mean... I think choosing who&#39;s worthy of living, that&#39;s not on us to decide as people.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I mean, if I had to kill someone? Sure. But it's not because I chose to, it's because their bad choices in life led them to that moment where karma decided they weren't worthy of continuing on, right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its a certain view Hanamura.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can explain it later..but for now guess i will relax on the bench
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So the recent genin killings were karma too?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man... I didn't hear nothing about that, don't quote me on anything.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked at Saigosame with some seriousness on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: That's been talked about all over the village...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: ... A-anyways...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I wonder if any of the teachers are going to be around soon. It would be amazing to learn more.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: For real? This is the first I'm hearing about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Anyway- Killing for the SAKE of killing is a sure-fire way to end up in bad karma. So, whoever DID do all that will get theirs soon enough.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) let the topic go, as he didn't want to sour the mood further, but nodded at Saigosame in response. Then, he turned to Hanamura. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hanamura,i will see you later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Think to do the whole..zoning out.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Are you alright, Najiro?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: im fine.Just gonna do some..napping
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Very well. We'll talk more later, then.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, I guess the Hyuuga have no trouble seeing at night, so they are fine appearing in the dark.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Ughhh... Hello, mister Sun.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Please shine ANYWHERE other than my face, thank you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) cast a lofty gaze on those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckles softly, looking over towards the Hoshigaki again.
<font color = white>&#34;You really are not a morning, or maybe even day person, are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yamaki (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: No such thing as karma...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shuddered for a moment, as he realized someone was observing them from behind, then turned around slowly.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean. When I get my good and proper eight to twelve hours a day...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Then I'm chipper as can be. Today is not one of those days...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: I'm sorry to hear that. If there's a way I can cheer your day up, I'd be willing to try?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) generalize gaze would slowly hone in on the person seeking eye contact with him.
  <font color = white>&#34;....?&#34;</font> - he tilts his head to the side.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (Back. Freaking cat jumped on my PC's Power Button. xD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) ponders, for a few moments. Eventually, he raises a hand, and points up at the sun.
<font color = white>&#34;Make THAT go away.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) he lifted one hand in a greeting at the newly arrived person. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Kfh, no, I'm kidding. I'm going to head back home and get some actual sleep. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) picked himself up from the ground with a grumble, stretching his arms for a few moments before lumbering over towards the wall to his west. Without a second thought, he steps over the threshhold into the water, and disappears under the current.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) leans his head over ever so slightly in that of a nod.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: He must be -really- tired, huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) took a few more moments to size the fellow student up, then nodded and turned back to the centre of the gathering place.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I suppose so. He was quite tired when he arrived. I suppose he really needs a long nap, then. Which is fine, no classes have begun yet - today at least. As far as I am aware.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Hm? Oh, hey there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) looks from side to side. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay then.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Since there aren't much of any teacher awake or around, should we try to train, like, spar or something?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: ...Oh that's where everyone is.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: And I suppose we could spar, if any of you are interested. Could even make a sort of 'team spar' to see how well we work together. But, do not feel forced to, of course.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns his head back to look at the finely dressed kid, then put up a hand as a greeting.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) muttered something beneath his breath and began advancing forward towards the crowd. Maintaining his silence he'd hope to melt into the group seamlessly as they continued their discussion. However it seemed as though there was about to be a spar between two of the children. 

Closing his distance tween him and the others, the child began assessing the two. Maybe they were the top boys of Amegakure, or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) folds his arms and watches the bout from afar.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets again.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m fine with a spar or anything, really. Team or not. But yeah, I do wish the teachers would wake up and such, heh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm up for it. Would be nice to know what and who I'm working with in the future.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) looked towards the Yuki and the green-haired person before chuckling, covering her mouth as she did.
<font color = white>&#34;Three of us, then... Well, I suppose you two could spar, if you&#39;d like, and I&#39;ll just watch? That is, unless someone would like to join in?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Sure, I'll be up for that. You, Kusahara?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, sounds good.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Well, shal we do it here, or wanna go elsewhere? You got an idea, Hana?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm fine either way, but we don't want to go too far, in case the teacher arrives.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: When I sparred earlier, we went west a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Lead the way, then.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Follow me, hahaha. -- Anyone wanting to watch, feel free to watch along, as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) stretches his arms then follows briskly after the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Here's where I sparred, so, go ahead and face each other.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) settles into a closed fist, narrow fighting stance, gaze locked with his sparring partner.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) smirks as he enters a most simplistic stance.
<font color = white>&#34;Alright, just a spar, no need for any &#39;cool stuff&#39; or, well, serious injuries.
Can&#39;t wait to see how we&#39;ll do, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) smirks as he watces the other student get closer as well.
His own movement slowing down just a bit, only to get closer still.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) slowly advances, his fists in front of his body to deliver quick jabs once he is near enough. Once Yuki is close enough, Kushara would charge, upper body leant forward, ready to deliver quick upward strikes at the jaw of his opponent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) watches the two of them closely, seeing as their speed wasn&#39;t much different than her own speed, the two must have other capabilities that improve them.
Her eyes squint as Subaru would slow down a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what he&#39;s planning...&#34;</font> She&#39;d whisper softly, only to watch Kusahara next.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) draws near, mild curiosity along his visage. As the sparring match of sorts commenses he'd allow his eyes to traces both of the trainers movements.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) didn&#39;t let his smirk fade. Not even in the slightest, as he would weave himself past the uppercut-attempt coming from Kusahara, before aiming a jab of his own at the taller&#39;s stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice try!&#34;</font>

[Agility: E+]
[Dodged: 1/4 ]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) snarls and catches Yuki's fist, using the momentum of his strike to pull him closer, ready to deliver an elbow strike at the back of his head.

[Dodged: 1/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) kept his smirk up even when his own strike did not land.
Nimble movements, at least, for their comparitive levels, would allow him to move around his sparring partner, aiming to reach his side, dodging the attack once more before aiming a strike at their hip.

[Dodged: 2/4]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gasped swiftly at the incoming strike, taking a step back to reposition himself away from the attack and gather his strength.

[Dodged 2/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) didn&#39;t hold back, he&#39;d rush forward, ready to strike again.
His feet would slide over the dirt below, before his elbow would aim its way towards Kusahara&#39;s chest.

<font color = white>&#34;Heh, trying to get away, are we?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) focused his gaze and waited for the Yuki to get closer, before taking a risky gamble, sidestepping just before the attack landed, hoping to deliver a punch to the cheeks and knocking his opponent on the ground.

[Dodged 3/3] </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) would move away just in time, moving his left arm to intercept the upcoming blow, moving it out of the way before his own fist would aim at the center of the other&#39;s stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;Not bad! But I&#39;m not going to take any of your hits if I can prevent them!&#34;</font>

[Dodged again]
[Strength E]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) could not move fast enough to avoid the confident fist stabbing into his stomach! It had enough force to knock the air out of him, and leaving him crumbled on the ground, gasping and coughing.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah.... okay... you win!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) blinked as the blow did it for him.
Subaru would scratch the back of his head, however, before holding a hand out for his sparring partner.
<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t give up so fast, but, uh, yeah... We&#39;ll both get stronger, for sure.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It seems that went well? Are you both alright? It is a noble thing to see that you don't persist further, Subaru. And don't worry, Kusahara, I'm sure you'll have another chance later on to show how good you are, or how much you've improved then.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) , still clutching his stomach with one hand, allowed the Yuki to help him up from the ground. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah... well I am not sure I&#39;m cut out to be a taijutsu master... sorry to disappoint.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) yells: Hey, now, not disappointed at all!
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Heh, it was fun though.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: And I'm alright, Hanamura. Thanks.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) wiped the saliva off his face. <font color = white>&#34;Hm... it was.&#34;</font> He smiled softly, trying his best to hide it though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded at the young girl, then nursed his aching belly as he aimed to walk back to the monument where they gathered previously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Everyone has left it seems? Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I will have a look around.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Well, a couple of them were hiding in the trees, observing us.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, yes, I did notice such...
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Not sure if they are still there.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, I shall be back soon.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I feel like a wimp after going down like that.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Don't be like that, you're fine.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly approaches the bench where the other two individuals are situated. Their eyes never averting their gaze away from the bench where they are approaching. She slowly sits on the bench, clasping his palms together and resting their chin on their hands.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) takes a deep breath, the pain in his stomach now only a mild sensation reminding him of his sparring match. As he heard the child approaching and sitting down, his attention was drawn to her. Noting the bored posture, he raised an eyebrow. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) looked towards the child, a slight ponder was made before he&#39;d speak up.
<font color = white>&#34;You okay? Got bored or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly turns their head towards the two boys situated on the opposite end of the bench. His soft features seemingly slightly shimmering against the bright sunlight. A small sigh escapes their lips, as they begin to speak.

<font color = white>&#34;Boring? Yes, I guess that is a good way to describe it. Nothing ever happens around here...&#34;</font>, they say with the tone of an irritant child.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nothing happens? What do you mean? A lot has been going on, and a festival is starting soon, as well...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) frowns slightly. <font color = white>&#34;I would enjoy the peace while it lasts, personally.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a small yawn as they sat near the monument his hazel eyes scanning the other faces nearby</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: All of that is...boring.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So what do you consider exciting?
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Anyways, Kusahara, got any plans?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: I dont know..Something...fun maybe?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turned to Subaru. <font color = white>&#34;Not really.&#34;</font> He said, leaning back on the bench, and turning to the new kid. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, like what? There are many things one can find fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I dont know.. Maybe playing? Like ninja tag!
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Right...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) almost chuckled at that. Despite being thirteen, he already felt like it was a lifetime ago when he found childish things fun. <font color = white>&#34;I mean, I guess that&#39;s fun. We&#39;ll be needing to catch people when we go out on missions anyway, so in a way... it&#39;s training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) slowly rises up and stretches before sighing. <font color = white>&#34;Anyway, I&#39;ll go home and read something. That&#39;s my idea of fun on a sunny morning. See ya!&#34;</font> He&#39;d say and walk off towards his house.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) yells: Satetsu. We have five people now!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Without strategy and mind...might is nothing but a foolish tactic
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Without might, the execution and protection of the one planning is null.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Mind without body is just theory.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: but body without mind is just being a animal.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looks at the gathering of people as he passes by, and decides to hang around by the waterside.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: ..FIVE!?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: WE NEED MORE, BILL.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: THAT'S NOT ENOUGH.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Am I counted in those five..
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Are you?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Question......
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I dunno.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Possible answer....
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Never mind it's Six now
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mitaki, Totsu(The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) OOCs: [Remade
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: ....Six??
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Well.. okay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) rubs his ears after that shout.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) taps his chin for a few seconds as he deadpans Bill.
  <font color = white>&#34;....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ...GOOD JOB, CABBAGE BOY.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: I'm assuming due to how some of you guys look the winner would just have bragging rights huh?Instead make an entrance fee where you need to give five or ten ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Nothin' is for free.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ...?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Bragging rights and the winning pot is up for grabs.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) coughed, clearing their throat before inhaling deeply.
<font color = white>&#34;Last Call for the Tournament! All who want to join, now your chance!&#34;</font>
They yelled, trying to get the attention of anyone interested.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns around, now understanding what&#39;s going on. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll just spectate.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) asks: You starin' me down?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Maybe I could join...
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I dunno...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Eh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) blinks and looks away,
<font color = white>&#34;Sorry...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: What's the price?
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Are you going to join the tournament? We have a Chuunin who's going to oversee everything.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: May i ask who is that jonin?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) shrugged and went back into her head. She needed to figure out what her aesthetics were going to end up like.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: uhm,i mean chunin
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's Miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh...the crazy one
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: So it's a chance to show them what skills you have and maybe impress a chuunin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) holds in a laugh at Najiro's description of a Chunin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Plus you get to see how you stack up to your peers
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, his mind instantly racing to address Rose&#39;s inquiry with his signature arrogance and pride. This challenge was an opportunity to assert himself and motivate others to step up.

<font color = white>&#34;The way I see it,&#34;</font> Sogeki began, his voice carrying an edge of aggressiveness and determination. <font color = white>&#34;We pool our ryo into a pot. The top three winners of the tournament not only claim their share of the pot but earn the right to brag. But here&#39;s the real deal,&#34;</font> he continued, his smirk widening as his arrogance shone through. <font color = white>&#34;Those top three? They&#39;re not safe. Anyone who didn&#39;t make it can challenge them. It&#39;s about more than winning; it&#39;s about proving you&#39;re the best.&#34;</font>

He paused for a moment, his gaze sweeping over the gathered peers. <font color = white>&#34;This tournament isn&#39;t just a chance to compete. It&#39;s a chance to show who&#39;s at the top and who&#39;s willing to fight to stay there,&#34;</font> he declared boldly, his tone challenging yet encouraging. <font color = white>&#34;So if you&#39;ve got any guts, if you think you&#39;ve got what it takes, step up. Train hard. Because this isn&#39;t just about dominance--it&#39;s about maintaining it.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s words hung in the air, a call to action wrapped in his trademark arrogance and pride. He knew his aggressive approach might rub some the wrong way, but he also understood the necessity of pushing his peers to strive for excellence, both individually and collectively.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Sounds cool.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He's kinda inspiring.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: He said it way better than i could have...
<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm...well hopefully the teacher allows us some free weapons
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: She said our wooden training ones are fine.
<br><font color=red>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Does she got wooden shurikens?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would nod their head which would give off the notion that she was considering in joining this little game of theirs.In reality Rose had already made up he mind and figured just by watchng the fight would give her a better out look on things compared to joining the action.

<font color = white>&#34;I see it does sound amazing,but i&#39;m going to have to decline.&#34;</font>A smile continued to linger on her face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Don't we all?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: What do you practice with?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Very well. Cabbage Boy! Did you gather everyone's names
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Throwable stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: ?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Shurikens,kunais,senbons.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Some shuriken would be cool.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I'm fine with using my fists though.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Wooden ones! I'm not throwing real weapons at you all-- Erm.. nor do I have any.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Names?...oh right names.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) says: I'm Nahoko.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Huh...surprized to see you talk

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eye would squint at the short red-heared boy, <font color = white>&#34;Oh your Uzumaki too?

Higane&#39;s right hand meets her chin, slightly obscurring her lips as she chuckles.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uzumaki, Nakagawa (The short red-headed boy-Godlike2909) rubbed the back of his head, his eyes moving onto the afro man as he waived, nodding his head to his words before giving a slight wave back, a small smile under his mask.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Nice to meet you and I&#39;m sure it will be easy to remember your name cousin!&#34;</font> He yelled out a bit, looking towards his cousin&#39;s head.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) arrives on the scene of the streets, where it seemed students were eager to start some kind of something. As an elder of the village, it wouldn’t go unnoticed.

<font color = white>&#34;And what have we here?&#34;</font> He asks in a very skeptical tone, brow raised behind the darkness of the hood and mask</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Alright ima go hand in the scroll then.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (test
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the mask man stopping mid step with a scroll in his hand.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh...Hello.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) wafts his hand about his nose, not much liking the smell of cabbage. Thankfully the smell didn’t really stick.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello young....student. What is all of this commotion....&#34;</font> he trails off, looking at the gathered many before continuing. But as if it were a new statement. <font color = white>&#34;About.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uzumaki, Nakagawa (The short red-headed boy-Godlike2909) glanced toward the commanding man, giving him a once over before he lowered down onto the ground, taking a seat.

<font color = white>&#34;Some kind of tournament is happening or something&#34;</font> He said as he raised and lowered his shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked flinched a bit as the commanding man waved his hand, and they felt self-conscious about their smell for a moment.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh, We are organizing a tournament amongst us students.
Miss Botan is going to oversee it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) Walks up to the group after hearing about a tournament and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh the kids are working on a little tourny, isnt that just fun.&#34;</font>

He continued to watch them to see how it woud progress.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) itches his chin for a moment, before loooking between the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Botan also going to be providing a reward?&#34;</font> He looks over to the Jonin, who would know this wasn’t a spectator from within the village. But one sent by the Shogun for the youth</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...i wonder if i can get wooden shurikens
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) spots the figure and offers a head nod. If he was luck it would be enough to lure him over to his side of the crowd. Should the jounin warp to his position a few words would be exchanged as they whispered to one another. Maintain a sense of privacy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) folds his arms while side-eyeing the jonin next to him. They reeked of something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) walks off to the side, half listening to what's going on behind him, while also just observing the body of water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shook their head.
<font color = white>&#34;They didn&#39;t offer one, so we were just going to try to pull whatever resources we had for the top three.&#34;</font>
They looked at the ground for a minute as so many high-ranking people appeared out of nowhere.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) kept herself still in the distance, their eyes seem to perk over towards the crowd with curiosity, the scroll carrier in the distance particularly catching up their attention, eyes press gently in a squeeze, only to widden again. They've managed to catch up the youngling's attention for the time being itseems.

A ceaseless, unblinking stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) noticing the boy nod to him he quickly walked around the group and made his way clumsily towards him. Not cool or interesting in the least. No teleporting or cool moves used. just akward <font color = white>&#34;excuse me, pardon me, sliding by&#34;</font> words as he made his way through the crowd. He would stop by the boy and smile. <font color = white>&#34;Need something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says:  We have nine people so if everyone pitched in it should be a nice little reward...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would pass the scroll to the commanding man showing them all the names</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I don't have any ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I am a jonin a rank above Chunin its nice to see so many new faces around here feels like this year is going to be an interesting one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) had paid close attention to the jounin as he drew closer to the cluster of children from the north. His posture, demeanor and tone seemed far too mature to be a chuunin. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Kryu&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You tell me..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Earlier people called themselfs bitch
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) squints her eyes from afar, nothing escapes the young girls vision.. Let alone a big celebrity like Shion.

<font color = white>&#34;Holy crap! It&#39;s Master Shion! He&#39;s like famous you know!?&#34;</font> She shouted over the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And their mother being a hoe
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Oh...another of the famous ones?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) reads through the scroll swiftly, with something tucked between the parchment now

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I can watch then 500 ryo goes to the victor, 250 to the runner-up&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) asks: A tournament? Now?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) He would present himself with a respecful standing expression and look at the young boy. <font color = white>&#34;You can call me-&#34;</font> He would hear the girl blurt out and he would stop looking respectful and start trying  to hide himself in his kimono.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Shion Aikawa nice to meet you.&#34;</font> He would say quickly trying to make his presense evaporate without success.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case...if they are given wooden weapons can i get wooden throwable ones.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) Looked to Higange Hyuuga as they shouted over the crowd for a moment before the commanding man spoke.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh...Of course, you can watch!&#34;</font> They yelled in excitement as it seemed they now had a prize.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: I'm Higane! Of the Hyuuga family, my brother is a big fan of yours!
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) yells: Miss Botan!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: Pathetic.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) ran up to the Chuunin with a scroll in his hands.
<font color = white>&#34;We did.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (Someone drop me a single ryo pls rq u will get it back)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) takes a deep breath and sighs.

<font color = white>&#34;Is he now. I am honoured. Uhm Higane was it. Could you lower your voice a little.&#34;</font>

He looked around hoping people would continue what they were doing. He gave her a polite yet akward smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Ah, you located a listing?
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I unfortunatly did not bring any weapons with me on my walk around the village.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) took a moment to obtain said scroll before she moved to unroll it, and thus begin to examine it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Nicely done and in a quick fashion,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It took a lot of work but we have Nine People for the Tournament.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It seems to make it even, we need one more.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) takes a deep breath as he floats back from his meditation, trying to pay full attention to what's going on around him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Unless one wishes to have two matches.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) had totally forgetten all formalities after seeing such a famous individual roaming the streets. <font color = white>&#34;And a.. oop!&#34;</font> She blurped out covering her mouth instinctively.

A deep, slow and controlled bow was returned towards the much older man. <font color = white>&#34;I apologize..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I got a question
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: We even got someone to offer up some prize money.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Can we get practice weapons for this tournament?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm? If you require weapons? I would advise they be made, till we are able to hand them out.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: 500 ryo for the winner and 250 ryo for the runner up.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Ah, good work.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I need throwable ones.
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Rocks.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Use the wooden practice sets, thats my plan at least.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: One must learn to turn everything into a weapon.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) they turned around to point to the commanding man who was offering the money but they were gone</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ..i need wooden shurikens.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: oh...he left
