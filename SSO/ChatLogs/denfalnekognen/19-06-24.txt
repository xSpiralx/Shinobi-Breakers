<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: We will be able to find out soon.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stares down at the coins and slowly moves to accept them. Now unsure if the use of the word 'change' was a pun or not.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I- Uh, I won't?
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Buy yourself a drink and let out some steam.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I just wanna make sure I understand this
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: I'm not old enough to drink yet- But I'll find something to buy that can take my mind off things, yeah. Thank you Old Man Tooki.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: You'll have your time to make that happen, just don't rush it and drive yaself mad.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: So yer' bettin' me 500 ryo. If you lose, you'll basically become my little helper~
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would be shocked! <font color = white>&#34;Huh a spy execution? Thats not good. I should have been there with my rock!&#34;</font> I said doing test throws. <font color = white>&#34;At least it shows no bad deed goes unpunished. Isnt that right bro?&#34;</font> She looked over to the heavy breathing kid.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: But you'll also pay up, riiight?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I could use a subordinate.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) Nods his head. <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think the rocks needed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: I hope it doesn't become like, a habitual thing... Seeing people die, not the spending money to make me feel better.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mhm..it was like..swamo swushh
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Does he even have 500 ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Don't take the bet, it's a set up.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Should you retain the victory.&#34;</font> The boy&#39;s glare never subsided, though it does seem to lack its signature, greed fueled gleam.

<font color = white>&#34;And if I am rendered the victor, I will only accept the sum.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmmm
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Not exactly, Tsuneko. It would be with Fubuki about.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Swamo swush?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: As we can see, she is not.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: I can't say it's the answer to everything. But, sometimes you need to find an other path to direct your emotions.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would jump into a stance and playfully swing her arm from left to right infront of her...while making sound effects.

<i>voowamm!</i>

<font color = white>&#34;mhm!...and in an instant..i think..it was...u-um...pretty graphic...to say the least..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Can I ask what your path is? Was?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Fubuki?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: You sayin' she's got tha' rest of yer' money?
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: That's how you keep a leveled head. And my path is simply to remind myself of my goal when moments get tough. Why did I take this burden and what do I get out of it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) pulls at his hair.

<font color = white>&#34;She currently holds... An amount that is greater than five-hundred ryo. If you wish to raise beyond five-hundred... We&#39;ll need to participate with her present.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) looked on in awe. What skill! What technique! What form!

<font color = white>&#34;Graphically cool!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: You might lean left or right on subjects, but sticking to your own goal is one thing that helps me keep clear.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Remember, last time you bet with him, he didn't have enough to cover his loss...
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: My goal... And why I'm taking the burden...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-ah...right! i cant be distracted...after me chobina and Choume follow me 
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: I know it's vague but it's simple enough for me to not be swayed into other paths.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: How did you find a goal that mattered? Like, right now I just want to be rich and famous but... That's not a heroes goal...
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: And that's what I wanna be. You know?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [ops..chonamu' this is what i get for multitasking!]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would move to follow Ume. <font color = white>&#34;Come on bro!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) looks over to Shadow Feather and nods his head. He follows after the girls.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: What, you wanted it to be something noble like "Save the people and free the world", hmm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirls her lengthy black hair as she pondered the thought. Honestly she&#39;d have thought this through much more, but her train of thought was interrupted not once, but twice already due to certain circumstances involving their higher-ups.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s very tempting ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she said, looking toward Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;But she&#39;s right. The last ante we had.. well you didn&#39;t quite honour that. You did show me some cash before but yer&#39; track record doesn&#39;t really uh.. inspire confidence. This is a -big- bet, ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Hehe, maybe?
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: I mean you can lie to yaself all you want. But I saved those farms and small towns because how the hell was I gonna survive if I ain't have no food?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Sides getting hooked on gamlin' ain't a good thing, my man.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Selfish, yes. But good came from it.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: So- There's nothing wrong with... a more selfish goal? As long as good comes from it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) looks around. Everyone was gone. . </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns from the library.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: In my opinion. Yes. A hero who wants to save other people to be free is selfish. They're forcing the world into a version of safe in their way only afterall.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Now, some shit is just evil and need to be wiped out. But anything beside those cases.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Huh... So even heroes are selfish in a way... I never thought about it like that.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: You know, you're super wise, Old Man Tooki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) heads back off the bench and to the area he tended to see all of the others. A few people seemed to be hanging in the street, and a few off to the sides.

Seemed like business as usual to him, though he was unaware of something might be going on. He waves to the group and stands idly by. Just in case there was a gathering for a reason</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Heheh. There's truly no one way to handle a situation. Someone will always think negative of it, ya pops probably thought that was the right thing to do, ya know?
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: I-I'm not sure about *that*... He's the Iron Vessel after all... I want to believe that it wasn't even him who did that. That it was that... thing inside of him....
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Ya know, I don't trust those things... But hey, I'm just a simple villager.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Nah, you're not just some simple or random villager. You're Old Man Tooki.
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers: Damn right!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) took a quick sip of something hidden up his sleeve.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) smiles and nods toward the old man. Raising a hand up to pat him lightly on the shoulder while saying,

<font color = white>&#34;I feel a ton better. Thank you, old man.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) simply unveiled three-hundred ryo, counting each individual bill arduously in front of the young Uchiha.
Well--actually, on top of her head. <font color = white>&#34;I would expect you of anyone to understand the weight this... <i>demurral</i> entails.&#34;</font> One hundred Ryo.

The Zhu slowed down his count, moving further and further into a more visceral tone when he spoke, <font color = white>&#34;There is value within these mere paper marks. Indeed, such an amount--I believe your tongue for it would represent... Divinity? Roughly of course, though I would be astonished for you to recognize such a phrase.&#34;</font> One-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;Merely, in a triviality--it would represent a net gain for you, would it not?&#34;</font> Two-Hundred.
<font color = white>&#34;Just a simple game that you have succeeded in many a process.&#34;</font> Two-Twenty-Five. <font color = white>&#34;<i>What is to prevent you from....</i>&#34;</font> Two-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Complete and utter dominion?</b>&#34;</font>Two-Seventy-Five.

With twenty-five ryo in hand, the boy places it a the Uchiha girl&#39;s nose.
<font color = white>&#34;Defeat me. That provides one-thousand Ryo. And any form of assistance you would comprise.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm here for you all, youngster.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: So- What's even going on over there...? Meixun are you really gonna risk being her slave just to keep gambling?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) turns his head toward Meixun.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) took another sip of something and knocked himself right out! The liqour bottle was now emptied and Tooki can sleep soundly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) thinks: It's probably fine to leave an old man drunk and passed out in the road, right?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) was astonished and completely taken aback for a moment. Was this boy, no this insect really counting his money on her head?! Of all places. This was nothing but utter disrespect. Who could assume it was otherwise. She grasped at the money, balling it tightly in a fist before thrusting it back into his chest with a bit of force. The Uchiha returned it. Her anger was prevalent and she hadn&#39;t even bothered to hide it.

She&#39;d continue to press into his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.....&#34;</font> she tried her best to contain her anger which resulted from the blatant condescension he&#39;d just exhibited. <font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t just a gambler. Maybe I didn&#39;t represent myself well enough. I&#39;m bein&#39; nice right now. So be happy. Happy I ain&#39;t Kickin&#39;. Yer&#39;. Ass and takin&#39; yer money after using my head as a table for your money.&#34;</font> her finger jabbed into the boy&#39;s chest with a few of the words she&#39;d uttered. 

<font color = white>&#34;You might just be the dumbest smart person I&#39;ve ever met.&#34;</font> she scoffed. <font color = white>&#34;Now then. I&#39;ll gamble with ya&#39;. And when I beat ya&#39; and if you can&#39;t pay up. Well, I&#39;m gettin&#39; my money from you.. from Fubuki. From whoever there is. But don&#39;t forget who yer&#39; dealin&#39; with, alright?&#34;</font> 

She&#39;d calmed herself down by now and withdrew her hand from his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s have some fun. I wanna take my mind offa&#39; that ugly execution anyhow.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Don't bet, Reilin.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: ..Do you mind if I join you two?
<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) asks: What's this? Something interesting is happening?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) nosily peeps on the on-goings.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) beckons the beige-haired youth over and gestures across the road.

<font color = white>&#34;The blueberry is a gambling addict. He&#39;s trying to sell himself, and money he doesn&#39;t have, to keep gambling and try to the girl in front of him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (try to beat*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I also take no responsibility for his addiction. That game of two-hundred awoke something in him and it's not my fault.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I blame Reilin, honestly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) rubs the back of his head watching his kin blow up. He wasn’t entirely sure what was going on beyond the gambling. However. Using his cousins head for a table wasn’t cool.

He clenches fist and shakes a little, but Reilin had herself handled. Even within their own village it seemed there might be people to look about. That was kind of a worrisome sentiment.

But...surely the all of aspirant meant no disrespect? But he didn’t say so either. The boy, for his first time, was truly conflicted on whether to get angry or keep calm</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;I refuse, Raku. Unfortunately, this is no mere sport.&#34;</font> Not anymore, at least.

The boy unveils the set of cards, Human, Animal, Plant. He reveals the full amount to the Uchiha girl, prior to connecting the stack back together--handing it over to Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;As per usual, Tsuneko roles as the mediator--a non partisan. Should she rein the victory? The bout is nulled, Should she be victorious alongside one of us? The victor is the challenger.&#34;</font> Sure, a simple set of rulings, nothing&#39;s quite changed.

<font color = white>&#34;... <b><i>Xieji</b></i>. Eleven bouts.&#34;</font> A sudden deathmatch, winner takes all.

Who will reign supreme? Meixun&#39;s pride against Reilin&#39;s own? Meixun&#39;s devilish temperament against Reilin&#39;s fury-driven luck?

It is a challenge of.... Well it&#39;s probably not <i>that</i> important, they are just kids settling their petty differences.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Eleven? So high?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I suppose it's a large sum.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) 


Human is 1
Animal is 2
Plant is 3

1 beats 2
2 beats 3
3 beats 1 </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Good luck Meixun...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (uh oh

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: UGH.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) looked toward the beige haired youth. 

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry kid, this one is for all tha&#39; marbles. I ain&#39;t lettin&#39; anyone get in the middle of this.&#34;</font> she said. Though she put on a brave face, she couldn&#39;t help but feel nervous. There was truly no telling how this would end.

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for helpin&#39; Tsuneko.&#34;</font> she said graciously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ah, draw.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Mn.... Null.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's not lose any momentum
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) asks: What might be the rush? It is purely fate, no?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Null, victory of Tsuneko.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I guess yer' right. We should enjoy ourselves
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: That won't be possible for yourself... Soon.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmm
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: One for you..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) held up one finger on his right hand, pointing it at her.

<font color = white>&#34;Ten left.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) used his left hand this time, pointing it at himself.
<font color = white>&#34;Nine.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Tch.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: !
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Eight.&#34;</font>

2 for Meixun.
1 for Reilin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Mn... Perhaps taking your time serves in favor..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I just gotta believe I'm lucky
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Sorry ol' Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: No need just yet, We wait on Reilin, of course.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Gan batte, Reilin-
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (1>2>3>1 btw)
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Two nulls simultaneously. Perhaps there are gods on your side.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I wish I could tell ya'.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) watches the game go on, but remains just watching</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) rubs her chin idly befor etossing another dice.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I must admit I think I enjoy this game more than 200.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: You're quite the integral participant, Tsuneko. I thank you for your presence.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) squints over them all idly for now.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Ah well.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hahahaha

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I would blame my sister... Yet we have yet to parttake in such an event.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) stretched and rolled his neck, he was showing his age.... By growing in impatience.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ack. I'm just used to playin' 200.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hmm? Lowering the requirement?

<font color = white>&#34;I s&#39;pose it&#39;s fair to lower if we&#39;re even then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I think you've done enough countin' fer today.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: If you insist.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's continue.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Again, seven bouts remain.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: C'mon, Tsuneko don't doze off on us just yet.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) quickly switches his index and middle fingers on his right hand to form the ok (three fingers) symbol on the said hand, pointing it over to the Uchiha.

All that stalling just for--

<font color = white>&#34;Four. We were null for five bouts subsequenting your fourth victory.&#34;</font> The boy held his right hand firmly, granting her a fifth finger. 

She only needs one left to win anyhow, meanwhile...
He needs four.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Now, as Tsuneko so gracefully stated...

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: Yes you did!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Eleven bouts, if you were to win totally, you would require a minimum of six victories.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: You hold five, I hold three.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Good sir.. By my count, I'm already -at- six.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) scoffed, clearly the girl was attempting to con him. I mean, she did win a few solid bouts, all he had to do was look back on them and...

<font color = white>&#34;Yes yes. You won the fourth and fifth bouts pretty swell, however whenever we arrived to our sixth bout, to which Tsuneko gracefully interrupted my v--&#34;</font> Wait.

<font color = white>&#34;S-Sixth.... Bout...&#34;</font> The sixth bout? Didn&#39;t he choose animal? An--

<i>She won the sixth bout</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What did I disrupt?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled a shit-eating grin. Looking directly toward Meixun. She relished in her victory, soaking in his expression right now as the realization had dawned on him. He&#39;d lost. He&#39;d lost without even knowing it. Admittedly she too was a bit air-headed and hadn&#39;t even realized she won. But to lose whilst unaware was an entirely different thing.

She decided to draw a final card but did not flip it up this time around. She merely placed it down face down and ended her turn.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game.&#34;</font> as he hand pulled off of the card she turned it at the wrist, palm outstretched. <font color = white>&#34;You owe me a lot of money.&#34;</font> she said, still grinning and awaiting her deposit.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Good luck getting it, Reilin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) Five-Hundred Ryo. Down the drain.

For what, exactly? He didn't really <i>want</i> the money. Only the victory, but he couldn't even afford that much. His brain was circling indefinitely: the character for six, dancing about his head, collapsing on his thoughts with a paperweight keeping a stack from falling--though the stack is stacked too high, the paperweight only uses the stack as a diving boad and knocks it over. Translating every piece of paper with one singular character.

<b><i>6</b></i>

Two-Hundred Ryo, a crumpled mess--caused wholeheartedly by himself, returned back to its rightful wielder.

And....And now....

And now.... The remaining three-hundred.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled softly as a sum of money was placed in her palm. She uncrinkled the mess of it and instead of feeling happiness, she was confused. Her head fell to a tilt. <font color = white>&#34;I must be losing my vision.. Or I can&#39;t count properly.&#34;</font> she said. She lifted the money to hold it up to the sun but with all the sand, dirt and debris flying about it was hard to see fully. Nevertheless it was painfully obvious; this was not 500 ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Is this going to transform into 500 in a moment?&#34;</font> she asked, lowering the money now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: T-T-T-Tha....Is T-wo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I warned you he was betting with money he didn't have.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Two...Two-Hu.....
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Where's the rest, Blueberry?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I-I...t It is.....
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: This is even less than you counted on my head.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why are you holding out on me?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Told ya, good luck collecting your winnings.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: He'll pay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) wore the slightest condolence in his eyes, for the dark side of gambling throwing someone into the red so rapidly and mercilessly. He gave slow shakes of head to the scene. 

<font color = white>&#34;Gambling is truly a dangerous vice.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It really is- Oh, I didn't even see you Katora. Hey.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Good evening, Hideo. I'm surprised you didn't join them.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Got tired of losing ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Just wasn't in the mood
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair, fair.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) How could he have been defeated!?

Actually

<b>BANG</b>

The boy knocked himself in the head, sticking out his tongue, Gon style.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry. Forgot one thing. I&#39;ve never won a single time I&#39;ve partook in such a challenge.&#34;</font>

He unveiled the final remains of the Ryo, smacking Reilin on the head playfully.
<font color = white>&#34;I would&#39;ve suspected a bloodhound such as yoruself to be able to recognize the stench of a proper sum... Ah well, suppose not.&#34;</font>
He still has the audacity to goad? Well, of course he does.
<i>He lost, he doesn&#39;t have anything left to lose anyhow.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hehehe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) side eyes Reilin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Suppose that settle's that, then.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Did he ever pay the remainder from the previous bet?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Youuuuuuu.....
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Meeeeeeeeee....
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Feels like I'm watching a crime.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Financial Murder. In broad daylight. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I believe the term is.... Extortion..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Its a crime he commit against himself, really.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s glee quickly returned to her. She added the remaining 300 to her stack of cash and thumbed through it to validate that it was all there. Once it was, the Uchiha tucked it away neatly in her kimono for safe keeping.

Though her smile had not faded just yet, she looked at him expectantly and without saying anything. Wide-eyed and staring. She heard his most recent words and this was her reaction. An unwavering stare, eyebrows risen in arches.

Finally breaking her silence. <font color = white>&#34;As I clarified before we began -and- you agreed. I get the 500 -and- you become my subordinate.. Did ya&#39; foerget?&#34;</font> she asked. <font color = white>&#34;I believe -your- response was... &#39;Should you retain the victory.&#39;..&#34;</font> her fingertips found themselves instinctively creating a finger-pryamid. Villainy.

<font color = white>&#34;Did ya&#39; forget? Huh? Did ya&#39;, did ya&#39;?&#34;</font> her brows rose even more, if that were possible. <font color = white>&#34;I guess -I- forgot about the initial 30 you still owed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. It's why I stay away from high-stakes gambles.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: A-Ah.. Subor...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (who took a bigger L. The prisoner or Meixun? find out next time on Shinobi Breaker Z)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Aaah soo sorrie! Not from dees land, no understand many words! Wel--Okey ByeBye Now!&#34;</font> 

He makes a mad dash for it, a maddeningly mad dash for it. So mad of a dash that the dust storm seemed to hold a horizontal vortex where Meixun once stood.

<font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Tomorrow! I promise you&#39;ll be allowed to... Aah! We shall discuss it further tomorrow!!!</b></i>&#34;</font> He screamed into the storm while fleeing.

[Gettin tf outta dodge]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) slicked his hair back, to uncover his ear. Almost believing that he&#39;s misheard them just now.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh. She&#39;s even becoming his Boss now? What&#39;s next? Did you wager years of each other&#39;s lifespans too?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Crazy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Almost, yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: He wagered being a slave or something.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) hadn&#39;t expected this turn of events to unfold. Meixun made a run for it! And a fast one too. Much too fast for her to keep up with even if she wanted. Though she didn&#39;t mind, he&#39;d have to come around sooner or later. 

<font color = white>&#34;Right. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be seein&#39; ya&#39;, Henchmen #1.&#34;</font> she called out as he disappeared out into the storm.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True, but it might be the debt-slave fear breaking his natural limiters.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. She was aware of the direction he&#39;d ran into.

<font color = white>&#34;Well that&#39;s poetic.. I imagine he&#39;s standing right under my Clan&#39;s insignia right now... Ran from me, just for the world to show him who he belonged to anyhow.&#34;</font> she mused at the idea.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Why did you call him Henchman number one? Are you planning to get more?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: ---
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's messed up man.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Classmates are friends, Reilin. Not property.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Honestly!

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I am -so- not her henchman.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: With his luck? Yeah, I can see that happening.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Never bet high, Hideo. Never bet high.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: It's not abuse. He can't gamble anymore now.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nuh-uh, learned my lesson. The universe doesn't want me to gamble anymore.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: He can gamble.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Are these allegations true, Mister Hideo? 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: But he was rejected, most viciously.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I have, however, since decided that they are both mean and also lame.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A wise choice, I'd say.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I've chosen to avoid women until I'm a jounin.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well- not avoid. But not worry about.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Shooting for Jounin? Ambitious. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Why wouldn't I? Tsuchikage would mean I gotta dethrone grandma.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: So Jounin's as high as I can get!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Considerate. Speaking of ranking up? We'll be graduating soon.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Are you ready for all that Genin work?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Yeah we will. Yeah I am. You?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well-
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yep.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Mm.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'm only missing two things.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Which would be?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A decent pair of squad members who use skills that work well with my own.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: T-That may be more important you already think...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Apparently part of the graduation is going off to fight rogues or something...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yeah? Sounds challenging.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Getting some insider details from your Dad, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: He mentioned it during the uh... class.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ahh. I might've missed that bit.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It was uh, hard to pay attention to yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: For sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Lot of moving parts...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like that dudes fuckin' head- Yeah I'm not sleeping tonight.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a solemn few nods to that.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Sooooo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Back to squads and stuff. What're you good at Katora? Besides throwing stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I plan to learn some Ninjutsu. Raiton, probably.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Throwing and raiton huh? Good combo, I think.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: How about you? Have you done the chakra-paper-test in class yet?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Ha, did it a long time ago!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: What'd you get?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Doton and Katon, just like dad and Himeki.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I might study some taijutsu later too. Not sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Or throwing stuff. All good choices...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Mm. Never a bad idea to dabble. 
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Sounds like you kids have it all figured out. A solid duo
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Maybe. How about you, Papiyas? Given your future any thought?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: I know you have your Kenjutsu... but will you branch out?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm not sure I'd call us a duo though.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I second that. Finding suitable squadmates demands a bit more thought.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Not that I don't like you Katora- You're cool. Weird, but cool. But yeah it takes a lot more thought than us just being the two guys who have an idea.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Gotta interrogate our classmates and really give it a think.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You'll be trusting one another with your lives, after all. There's a lot to consider.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Exactly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (sorry gaming)
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I will be a sword saint. I will make the budda blush with each swing of my blades
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Anything else....uneeded.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Dedicated to your craft. I can respect that.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (costs me 89 points to go my build. Thats without OED. Cores and mostly 2 handed is full build.)
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: ....Where am I?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Iwa again.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Thought you could smell us old man
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Man, I've never been up this late. Is it always this quiet?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: More or less. But there tends to be a high point
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Oh yeah? When's it gonna be you think?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: At any point....but its truely up in the air. My life has moved so fast it nearly feels like it could all be condensed down into afew days.....or perhaps I am rambling hahaha
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-No, no, I know what you mean.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Could always peek at the gates or up where the business from earlier took place. Surely some Shinobi are lingering about
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: The gate, maybe. But... I really don't wanna see the stage again for a few days.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) nods her head. She could understand the feeling. <font color = white>&#34;They say all return to heaven. Even the bad are recycled. So not something to fret about.&#34;</font> 
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean the guys soul isn't what I'm concerned about...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Oh? Hmm....I cannot say I understand your worries then.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Y-You don't have a problem with watchin' a guy get his head bashed in, and then sent flying? And a your classmates covered in his blood?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) hummed again. She stroked her chin as she gave the boys words some consideration. She had hardly dwelled on the events, afterall she knew what she signed up for. 

<font color = white>&#34;No I cannot say it is that suprising. I have seen death tho not so.....graphic.&#34;</font> her voice trailed in a moment of thought. 

<font color = white>&#34;I signed up to be a Shinobi, once in history it was the custom to sever your kills heads to prove you had done your job. All is mandated by heaven, ultimately how one dies is irrelevant. What matters is what we accomplish in this mortal plane.&#34;</font> She smiled then. Surely the lad would now understand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stared at the woman for a few quiet moments. Trying to process her funny words. Not really understanding most of the spiritual jargon though due to being an idiot. But he did at least understand <i>part</i> of it,

<font color = white>&#34;I &#39;unno man... I think the way you dies matters a ton. If it&#39;s slow and brutal and humiliating that kinda fuckin&#39; sucks. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Like- dying on a mission is one thing. But being put on display for a bunch of kids?!
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I may call you children but.....what do you think happens to someone if you actually hit them with one or two of those paper bombs? It will be much worse than a simple beheading. Truely if you dont behead them soon afterwords it could be very terrible. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Like I said a mission is one thing- But being an example like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: They should've like... Stabbed him in the heart or something. Not beat him up a ton and then sent his head flying like that...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: My sister didn't need to see that...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I disagree....once word spreads it will keep you and your sister safe from harm. The fear will grip those in the shadows thinking of harming us.  
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'd rather not live in a world where everyone's just afraid of one another...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Then you prefer strangers carrying the headband of me, or your sister? The truth is I doubt just a killing will stop us from being attacked if we venture outside the village.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Seems like everyone is sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I never said any of that! Just that friends are less likely to attack you than people who hate you.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hey Chobina. We're just talkin' about the 'class' earlier.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Oh I wasnt there!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: What happened
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: My dad beat up a prisoner really badly and gave a speech about strength being important. Then Kitsumi cut his head off.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: The samurai?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I 'unno. Never saw the guy before.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh, well they shouldnt have done bad! Sucks that they died tough. Death is so scary.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Right?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Finally someone else fuckin' agrees! I swear half our class is like, psychopaths or something. No one seems to care that the dude's blood sprayed the entire front row.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Everyone's just like 'oh death is cool and fine and doesn't matter haha.' And I'm like... Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: It does take a scary mindset to not be off put by death. Even though we are child soliders. death is still scary.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: You need to have a screw loose for this kind of work
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and lets out an exasperated sighs. Mumbling to no one in particular,

<font color = white>&#34;I swear some people even fucking enjoyed the whole ordeal...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Dying on a mission is one thing. You can at least know you did your best. That your squad is trying to avenge you or whatever. But a prisoner like that? In such a brutal way? It's just messed up man..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I don't like that the beast is doing to my dad...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: He wasnt always like that?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head again, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve <b>never</b> seen him get like that before. And I&#39;ve really pissed him off plenty of times. He even had this like... steam or something coming off of him and this weird red chakra...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Scary
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Makes me glad I'll never be picked to be the next vessel.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I can say the same thinking back to my own family.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: You can?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Yea... they were trying to make my family a vessel but he didnt like that and ignoed the rules. So they killed him when he rampaged.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Daaamn... My condolences.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Hey Papaya~
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I hope dad doesn't make that kind of mistake either.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: We will have to grow stronger together to prevent it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Heh, was already the plan! Just another reason to make it happen though.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Mhm~
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Talk of squads was discussed earlier

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh, you look like you're kinda related to Reilin, Suzaku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) brought her balled-up fists to her eyes, rubbing them gently as if the morning light was too much to bear. She blinked, trying to focus, and as her vision cleared, she found herself squinting at Chobina.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you too, Chobin.,&#34;</font> she said, her voice still held the softness of sleep. She lowered her body into a formal, polite bow, a gesture of respect that seemed almost out of place in the haze of early morning.

Rising slowly, she hesitated, her mind drifting to the conversation she had overheard earlier. Her face adopted a puzzled expression, and she bit her lip, nervousness flickering across her features. The corner of her lips twitched as she struggled with the question she felt compelled to ask.

Fingers twiddling, she finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, <font color = white>&#34;Is it true someone was beheaded?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) I nod my head. <font color = white>&#34;I wasnt there thankfully, but I heard about it. It was pretty day but thats what criminals get.&#34;</font>

The cubby girl was tired herself but she was head to bed rather than waking up. She had a bit of time to spare though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was trying to forget everything that had happened the day before, but the moment someone brought it up all the bad memories came flooding her at once, emotionally overwhelming her. The girl put her hand on her stomach while avoiding looking at anyone, her gaze fixated on the water in front of her.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, they executed a prisoner and made us watch, but that wasn&#39;t the worst part. It was right before that when things got ugly. It still makes me feel sick thinking about it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah... It was a bit more than just a beheading...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (myy daily...finally...ken spec...)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) yawned into her palm <font color = white>&#34;That is so. Such acts will keep us safe, as I was explaining to Hideo here.&#34;</font> she gave the boy a wink. As if they shared some secret. 

<font color = white>&#34;I have considered taking up the practice myself. If we behead anyone who faces us then noone will question Iwagakure when we step outside our walls.&#34;</font> she yawned again and looked up at the sky.

<font color = white>&#34;About time I rest however....good day children.&#34;</font> she say and give them all a bow before making her way to a bench to snooze.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) reaches into his pocket and produces a very crumpled wad of, what was probably, three-hundred ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Here, get a super cool sword.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at the wad of money and immediately shaked her head while waving her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;No, you don&#39;t need to do it really! I appeciate it but like, it&#39;s a lot.&#34;</font> Fubuki spoke quickly due to being flustered, it was an unexpectedly cool moment from Hideo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and gestures with the money again,

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, spending money makes me happy.&#34;</font>

Lowering the money slightly he smiles. How blessed was he that getting money was his primary goal solely because spending it made him happier... He, however, does not miss an opportunity to be slightly snide,

<font color = white>&#34;Even though you&#39;re sometimes mean and lame. You <i>do</i> need a sword so you can actually fight and stuff. All I need is my dad to stop being lazy and teach me jutsu.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched her head while thinking about it, she couldn&#39;t even jokingly bully him. So many people had already helped her and she couldn&#39;t help people back. Eventually she caved in and sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay fine. I accept it if you insist. But for my next katana I&#39;ll try to make the money on my own -- and if you need ANY help, you ask me. You got that?&#34;</font>

She stepped forward and put her hands on her hips, looking at him seemingly upset though her face betrayed her intentions, which were just being serious about her promise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (GRAHHH)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) nods his head and hands her the money, <font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;m immediately calling in my favor; be less mean to me.&#34;</font>

With that handled, he spins to face the old man. Using his still out-stretched hand, now freed of money, to point at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I totally heard you say us having elemental jutsu would be &#39;troublesome&#39;! I&#39;m gonna learn to throw fireballs <b>and</b> mountains and it&#39;ll be the complete opposite of troublesome! It&#39;ll be... helpful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately nodded and grabbed the money, putting it alongside her stash. Just enough for the katana she had ordered.

<font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;ll only be mean if you&#39;re mean to me though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have my word I won't start shit though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I would never treat you like one! I'm usually the punching bag.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Trust me man I may laugh and smile but it tooootallly sucks most of the time.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If it makes you feel better, I was always joking. Sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, I figured. Thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think Tsuneko may be the only one that actually means it... I 'unno.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nah, she's messing with you too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I don't think anyone actually hates anyone else here.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hrm, I hope so.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) rested his good eye on Hideo while the other glances at Fubuki. He&#39;d let out a troubled sigh as he thought about his days of fighting against ninjutsu.

<font color = white>&#34;You youngsters are something else.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw the man look at them each with a separate eye and couldn&#39;t get that mental image out of her mind. It just might be more traumatizing than yesterday.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, what would be helpful then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Maybe someone will ask me to relocate a mountain range or something heroic like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like, literally carving a path through the mountains or something. That'd probably be super helpful.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Took much plate shifting with cause an earthquake.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'll make the earth stop moving, easy.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hey, I'd be the one carving through the mountains with my sword.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Swords.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fair. But I bet I could just like... rip chunks out of the mountain super easy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Carve a valley with my barehands...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like diggin' through sand at the beach...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) asks: My idea of being helpful is selfish. I would make sure I'd use ninjutsu to protect the crops and livestock! How could I sleep with a full stomach if there's no food?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah but that's like- obvious stuff! I thought wanted unique examples or something!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm a simple man.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: My way of being helpful will be cutting down anyone who attacks us.

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Mm, the small stuff is usually glanced over until those things are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh I guess that's true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I guess all the small stuff would probably be good training too right?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Damn right, if you're going to reach your -goal- then you're gonna have to leave no stone unturned.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think it might be literal stones when it comes to doton training.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, I see what you did there.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Say, Old Man Tooki, what kinds of stuff did you do when you were 'cleaning up the streets'?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was full of energy and brimming with taijutsu mastery.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was gaining experience left and right, finishing fights fast.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) thinks: Please don't take off your robe and flex again-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) swiftly sent two strikes Eastward. Loud pops from joints, muffled by cloth, bounced from off the mountains.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had only the vaguest understanding of taijutsu basics, if even that. So just seeing two punches performed was enough to convince him.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Woah, he actually does know stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: What a time it was to be alive... I think out of fifty, there's only been two farms that were too much to save.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Whoa really? What happened to them?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Too much ninjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: I was completely outclassed!

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I need ninjutsu...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: At that point, I think I reached the peak of taijutsu. Swiftness helped me avoid certain things to close in.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wonder how fast I have to throw a mountain for someone to be unable to just... avoid it with swiftness...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Depends on the person.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Does this make Yurei the strongest Student, by the way..
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A title like that wouldn't bring me any joy or sense of accomplishment at all. He can have it.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'm content enough with improving myself. Bit by bit.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Huh? I spaced out. Did Katora and Yurei spar or something?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: We did. It was fun too.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Damn, shame I missed it. Who won?

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: They made us look like chumps

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Alright what about strongest Genin? That carries a bit of weight
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I surrendered, but it felt more like a draw.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wasn't carrying enough weapons at the time to capitalize on the advantage I created.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Well, least you know what you gotta work on. Right?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: And.. it's too early to tell.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'll be happy so long as I can make our enemies look like chumps.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Why would I teach the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why would anybody?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: It's all they can do.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Why would a super handsome mountain-throwing hero like me only be able to teach the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: It's a respectable job. Isn't your accomplished Dad doing exactly that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, doesn't mean I wanna do it too.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair enough.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Being a teacher sounds laaaame.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It ain't lame.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I didn't say that it was! I said it *sounds* like it is!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Well I'm telling you what it isn't then!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Kitsumi seems to enjoy her work.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No one's gonna clap and cheer and shower me in wealth and praise if I said "I'm a teacher at the academy!". But they will if I say "I'm super cool and throw mountains!"
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And that's what matters.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Is praise all you care about?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And wealth.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Or maybe it's the sealing someone in a prism aspect that has her grinning so much.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Throw mountains?
