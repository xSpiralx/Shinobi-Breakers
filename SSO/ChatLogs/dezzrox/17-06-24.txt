<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) took note of the passive force displayed and waited for a response, though he was young, the academy student was well aware all intel whether big or small was vital when formulating a course of action. However, he thought it was pretty childish and naive to approach such a towering figure un-armed, especially in the blood-thirsty ninja world. 

Thought: <b>Maybe this is the perfect time to ask</b>

<font color = white>&#34;If you are indeed a shinobi of the village, would you be willing to take me on as a student? I would vow never to speak of your existance nor pesture you for your mentorship.&#34;</font> 

Afro intent was truly to learn the way of the shinobi. 

<font color = white>&#34;As a token of our arrangement would you willing to gift me a single kunai with your engraving?&#34;</font>

Should the figure accept, Afro&#39;s journey as a shinobi would begin. Creating a storyline far different from those in the limelight. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Walaaahhh~.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: ...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would look toward the afro haired child, before nodding at his question. The masked individual had multiple layers on which made it very difficult to see any skin on his body. The only noticeable thing would be his white spikey hair. Other than that...there was no hint as to what he looked like. He would once again take to his book and his pen.

<font color = white>&#34;I will not apologize for the bruise that has formed on your arm. You would be the same, if you have lived the life I have been through. Spies within your own village from another, trying to find the person they are looking for, just so they can finally be rid of Amegakure&#39;s Executioner.&#34;</font>

His visage would look towards the afro kid, before shaking his head no. Once again, taking to another page of the book and writing down again.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not take students, personally. But...that does not mean I will not be making sure you all are in tip-top shape to take the lives of our enemies. Perhaps, if one of you proves yourself within the coming year or two, I will change my mind, Just know...I will be watching and paying attention to your growth. A of current, it is too early to decide if any of you are worth my time to personally oversee your training and abilities.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Hey!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Amekagure...Executioner?
<br><font color=red>*Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffff66>Kyumuku, Koyabashi (The ugly bully-Dezzrox) gestures at the masked figure. <font color = white>&#34;Nice mask, nerd.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Hey guys..whats going on?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Well this Amekagure executioner guy almost broke my hand. Look!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) holds up his small blue and purple hand which is obviously bruised from nearly being crushed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With that guidance, the girl bursts onto the scene of gathered individuals. She steps forward, her height in stark contrast to the masked individual. The contents of their conversation don&#39;t even register in her mind. Throughout that group, only one youth gains the attention and ire of the blonde&#39;s sunset-colored iris.

     <font color = white>&#34;<b>Runt!</b> We&#39;ve still got a score to settle!&#34;</font>

One hand moves to her own hip. The other extends outward, a dedicated point thrust right towards the cold one&#39;s face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) Took note of the figures words and recorded his title as <b>Amekagure Executioner</b>

Squinting his eyes he&#39;d respond, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be sure to rise up to the occation and claim the position... I to will become a shadow of the village&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: hana...stop this
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid-sentence when he hears a familiar screech. Quickly hiding his hand back in his kimono sleeve. He would look over to the blonde haired hag from the other day.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh no.&#34;</font>, he thought, slowly moving backwards away from the girl, his cold eyes intently locked onto her.

<font color = white>&#34;You stay away from me, ha-....Lady..&#34;</font>, he said coldly. Best not to antagonize one with such monstrous strength.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Should be fine, Naji'.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;No can do!&#34;</font>

Even the mentions and quick brandish of his injured hand don&#39;t phase her or halt her approach. Once more, that invisible spark of tension radiates from her eyes as the two lock their gazes. Her target had already been set.

     <font color = white>&#34;Executive orders, short-stuff. Hand over your shoes!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: What she said. Would rather strong-arm them from you than one of my cousins.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would hear some rather newer voices, one&#39;s he hasn&#39;t even seen or met yet. It had seemed the village was bursting with energy, but...he didnt care for the commotion in which was going on. He didn&#39;t turn his visage towards anyone, in fact, he was focused on one thing and one thing only. The destroyed village that was currently needing to be Reconstructed. So, the masked figure would push his way through the younger generation, giving them no time of day.

He had decided, to be done with conversing for now, especially while there was work to be done. The book and pen, would be placed within his equipment. Before he would finally speak, a low and dark voice would come out of his mask.

<font color = white>&#34;If you wish to fight each other over some trivial matter...then proceed.

But, if you wish to show me your value and worth to the village...then it&#39;s time to put your actions where your mouth is. In but a few moments, I am going to begin Reconstructing our Bridge that was blown up by those damn Dakuteika heathens.

So, either help...or get out of my sight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
