<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Cheddar(The rat-Karlach) OOCs: (i mstuck)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh,a new comer
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Yeah, morning, morning...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Too early... I want to go back to sleep...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) tilts her head lightly to the side as she hears the boy.
<font color = white>&#34;I can understand that, although I personally would not. But may I ask, why would you prefer to sleep?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) rose a brow, before allowing his shoulder to shrug, and drop to his sides. 
<font color = white>&#34;Why not? Sleep is good. A little nap, here and there... You can&#39;t beat it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Everyone seems to be napping anyway...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hmmm... Well, I think you could always rest by the tree? None should scold you or anything for doing so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Tchhhh... Who's going to scald me? It's like he said, everyone's asleep anyway. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That... is what I said, nobody is going to scold you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) blinked. He slowly nodded his head.
<font color = white>&#34;Yeah... Yeah, I&#39;m. I&#39;m tired. The sun&#39;s too bright....&#34;</font>

Without another word, he moved towards the shade of the tree, one hand rubbing at his eyes as he dropped down onto the ground and hunched over in a seated position.
<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you both awake, anyway? You could be sleeping too.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im normally around this time of the day awake
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: As for her...i guess its the same thing?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) covered her mouth with her hand as she nods.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m awake because I wish to train and learn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) wanders into what should be described as a square of sorts.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey.&#34;</font> He greeted the group already there before moving his hands into his pockets.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckled once more as more and more people came to be around.
<font color = white>&#34;Hello, everyone. Nice to see more people around again.
I wonder, though, if the Hyuuga Clan Head will be around, soon, as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) is found staring at the sky, arms across his chest. The voice of the approaching boy snaps him to attention. <font color = white>&#34;Oh... hey.&#34;</font> 
He then looks to the stranger girl. <font color = white>&#34;Why, is there some sort of special occasion?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He gives the scrolls.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) shakes her head slowly, yet her smile would not fade.
Instead, her eyes would scan the two recently arrived.

A green-haired individual, and a black-haired one.
The Green-haired one seemed taller, more mature than herself, or even more-so than the other person.

As for the black-haired one, they seemed feminine, at least, to her.
<font color = white>&#34;Nothing too big should be happening, unless the Festival of Water has begun - But I think it has yet to begin... I believe. As for other activities, it would be the academy.&#34;</font>

The girl moved a hand through her hair before continuing.
<font color = white>&#34;Are you both students as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (hanamura,where did you got that profile code?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (A friend. ^^ Why?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i might need it XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (wondering if it will prevent that discord annoyance of changing their link every couple of days
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) turned to his side, looking at the green-haired male before looking around some more, noticing the shark-boy as well.
He'd raise his hand in greeting towards them, a light smirk visable, before he'd listen to the girl some more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded his head, taking a bit of time to read the soft spoken person on the bench. He took note of the courteous smile, which caused him to stare for a bit too long, but then he quickly averted his gaze once their gazes met. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (The profile sadly won't accept Discord Pictures, hence why my first playby failed. But it should work with other sites' pictures, I think.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (discord nerfed using images
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (u gotta host external now
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) got up from her seat, taking a position more centered on the group, rather than sticking to one side of it.
<font color = white>&#34;I do assume you&#39;re both students, as well? What about you?&#34;</font> She&#39;d ask, looking over to the Shark-like boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (not only images but mp3 files too 
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mmmm-hm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well...is nice to finally see more people.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I'm a student, yes. Yuki, Subaru. Pleasure.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...oh,explains your
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Feminine look
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) offered a nod in confirmation towards the lass, shifting his form to avoid a particularly annoying beam of sunlight breaking through the tree-leaves.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Nice to meet you too, Subaru. I am Hanamura.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked around, taking note of everyone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kusahara. Student.&#34;</font> He said briefly, but with a bit more volume in his voice this time so everyone could hear.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well Hanamura,is seems we found out  other students.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That's correct, yes. And I do hope more will come, as well. Even so, I am pleased to see more and more are waking up.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Either way, nice to meet you, as well, Kusahara.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded in response. <font color = white>&#34;And you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) let out a sharp wan, reclining back somewhat, the pale-skinned individual almost threatening to fall back onto the ground from his seated position. 
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, right. Introductions, uh... Hello. I&#39;m Saigosame. Of the Hoshigaki clan. Just, you know, in case there was any doubt.&#34;</font>, he remarked, following with a brief chuckle at his own joke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Might I ask, have either of you decided on a goal or focus, yet? For myself, I like to train in Ninjutsu and Taijutsu. But I am also still open for learning other paths, of course. - And pleasure to meet you, Saigosame, as well.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nice to meet you all. Good to see a Hoshigaki about, and glad my eyes didn't fool me, heheh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) scratches the back of his head, smirking lightly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank stare to the question stated, looking back up at the sky to find some sort of sign or answer, finding none. In the end he just shrugged, looking at the others and listening to their answers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Ah, sorry, as far your question...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) yells: I suppose Ninjutsu, yes. Maybe some additions for self-defense in close-combat could be great!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: We have one blacksmith and one future medic besides her
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Cool, well, medics are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah,medics and blacksmiths are more uncommon aswell.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Hm... 
<br><font color=red>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=red>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, if any of you have questions, or need anything, feel free to ask. -- Then again, I'm sure we're all on equal level, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: After what ive seen from you Hanamura? Im unsure,atleast for myself
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) noticably entered a thoughtscape that painted his expression a bit grim, but it faded in a few moments, possibly snapped out of it by Hanamura. <font color = white>&#34;I wonder about that.&#34;</font> He would respond to her assumption. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) clapped his hands together.
<font color = white>&#34;You know what? This place needs a map. It&#39;s like a maze, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I agree.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its fine.Perhaps you guys need to go out more
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It can be confusing, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can easily remember it.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Exploring does help.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Be back soon a moment, sorry.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looks at Saigosame with narrowed lips, and shrugs as if to say <font color = white>&#34;I guess it&#39;s just you and me.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I could do with some sightseeing later, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: But it shouldn't be too difficult to remember everything, heh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) took a glance back at Subaru, and let out a defeated sigh. Now as forever, the Yuki and the Hoshigaki were united.
<font color = white>&#34;Man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) noticed the Hoshigaki&#39;s glance, making him blink a couple times.
<font color = white>&#34;Something wrong?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (oh, i'm cooked, that was meant for kusahara. my bad. i misread the chat.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (No worries. xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Huh? No. I mistook you for Kusahara. Listen- I'm REALLY tired.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) closed his eyes and took a deep whiff of the chill dusk air. 
<font color = white>&#34;Getting late.&#34;</font> He muttered to himself. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) eyes Kusahara and then looks down his own form.
<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we do look similar.&#34;</font> He&#39;d jest before shrugging.
<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, all is fine, really.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: More like getting early if you ask me, though.
<br><font color=red>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (god, this 3 pp is vile... 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (BRB)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (i missed wipe start last time i played srp so i was getting catchup and shit, but this.....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Early, late... It's all good time for sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Sounds like you'll need a pillow on your desk at the Academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) said with a slight smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I guess everyone is traning?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If I sleep through the lessons I'll end up super-behind.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or you guys just study inside the academy only
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I'm not some sort of super-genius... You know?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not either,but is good to practice what you have learned.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shrugged once more. <font color = white>&#34;I study on my own, but nothing too serious.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns to acknowledge the newly arrived person.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I see...then,what do you want to do after the academy ends?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Has...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Has the academy even STARTED yet?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank look to that question. <font color = white>&#34;What does a bird want to do when it&#39;s no longer a chick? We are Shinobi, most of us here will be fighting and probably dying for the village.&#34;</font> He said plainly. <font color = white>&#34;Hopefully dying later than sooner...&#34;</font> he added in a low tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It did started.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It will end in a year.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And...not everyone is a fighter.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: It is why I said "most of us here."
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: True..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case..hopefully we meet each other thoughout the year and inside the battlefield.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded and tried to shake off the grimness of his words, almost as if they were not his own. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: By the way, did I not catch your name, or...?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yakushi,Najiro
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I am back.)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Future medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, sorry, I must have been deep in thought, I see we have another fellow student? Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded. <font color = white>&#34;Ah... so you&#39;ll be trying to keep us among the living.&#34;</font> He said with a soft smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked once again at the child in the kimono, who has not said a word since they arrived.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: More of keeping people who are worthy to live.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But yes,trying to keep people alive.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Noted.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I would say all lifes are worthy, really...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) pulled his sunhat over his eyes, mostly to avoid the glaring light of the streetlamp above him.
<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s a kinda weird way of looking at it, I mean... I think choosing who&#39;s worthy of living, that&#39;s not on us to decide as people.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I mean, if I had to kill someone? Sure. But it's not because I chose to, it's because their bad choices in life led them to that moment where karma decided they weren't worthy of continuing on, right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its a certain view Hanamura.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can explain it later..but for now guess i will relax on the bench
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So the recent genin killings were karma too?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man... I didn't hear nothing about that, don't quote me on anything.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked at Saigosame with some seriousness on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: That's been talked about all over the village...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: ... A-anyways...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I wonder if any of the teachers are going to be around soon. It would be amazing to learn more.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: For real? This is the first I'm hearing about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Anyway- Killing for the SAKE of killing is a sure-fire way to end up in bad karma. So, whoever DID do all that will get theirs soon enough.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) let the topic go, as he didn't want to sour the mood further, but nodded at Saigosame in response. Then, he turned to Hanamura. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hanamura,i will see you later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Think to do the whole..zoning out.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Are you alright, Najiro?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: im fine.Just gonna do some..napping
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Very well. We'll talk more later, then.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, I guess the Hyuuga have no trouble seeing at night, so they are fine appearing in the dark.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Ughhh... Hello, mister Sun.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Please shine ANYWHERE other than my face, thank you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) cast a lofty gaze on those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckles softly, looking over towards the Hoshigaki again.
<font color = white>&#34;You really are not a morning, or maybe even day person, are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yamaki (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: No such thing as karma...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shuddered for a moment, as he realized someone was observing them from behind, then turned around slowly.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean. When I get my good and proper eight to twelve hours a day...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Then I'm chipper as can be. Today is not one of those days...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: I'm sorry to hear that. If there's a way I can cheer your day up, I'd be willing to try?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) generalize gaze would slowly hone in on the person seeking eye contact with him.
  <font color = white>&#34;....?&#34;</font> - he tilts his head to the side.</font></font></font>

His stride was purposeful, each step echoing with a quiet confidence that demanded attention. The onlookers, a mix of curious students and seasoned shinobi, instinctively parted to make way for him, sensing the aura of determination and power that surrounded him.

His cloak billowed behind him, adding to his imposing figure, and his icy gaze swept across the arena, taking in every detail with a keen awareness. The sinister smirk on his face played at the corners of his lips, a subtle promise of impending action and calculated moves.

With a deliberate motion, Sogeki cracked his knuckles one by one, the sound echoing faintly in the silence. It was a gesture of readiness, a physical manifestation of the energy coursing through him. His eyes narrowed slightly, focusing on the challengers gathered in the arena, each one a potential obstacle to overcome.

A low murmur of anticipation rippled through the crowd as they sensed the imminent clash of wills. Some regarded him with apprehension, others with curiosity, but all acknowledged his presence with a mixture of respect and wariness.

Without a word, Sogeki positioned himself at the center of the arena, his stance firm and balanced. He exuded an aura of dominance and readiness, a silent challenge to anyone bold enough to face him. The smirk on his face widened imperceptibly as he awaited the beginning of the tournament, eager to prove his strength and assert his place at the top.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki methodically paces towards Higane, the air thickens with oppressive tension. His every step echoes with quiet menace, each footfall calculated and deliberate. The onlookers, usually boisterous and lively, fall into an uneasy silence as they witness the unfolding scene.

Sogeki's demeanor is chillingly calm, his eyes narrowed into icy slits that seem to pierce through the very soul of anyone who dares to meet his gaze. His presence exudes an aura of impending danger, like a predator stalking its prey with unwavering focus.

The sound of his footsteps reverberates ominously in the arena, setting off a cascade of nervous whispers among the spectators. Some shift uncomfortably, their instincts screaming at them to flee from the palpable threat emanating from Sogeki.

Higane, standing firm in the face of this approaching storm, can feel the weight of Sogeki's gaze bearing down on him like a heavy yoke. A cold sweat breaks out on his brow as he realizes the magnitude of the challenge before him.

With each passing moment, Sogeki closes the distance with a deliberate slowness that only heightens the tension in the air. His movements are fluid yet controlled, like a coiled serpent ready to strike at any moment.

Finally, he stands mere paces away from Higane. Sogeki's lips curl into a menacing smirk, devoid of warmth, a harbinger of impending turmoil and ruthless determination.

The arena falls into an eerie silence, anticipation hanging thick in the air like a suffocating fog. All eyes are fixed on Sogeki and Higane, two forces on a collision course destined to unleash chaos and turmoil upon the arena floor.</font></font></font>
