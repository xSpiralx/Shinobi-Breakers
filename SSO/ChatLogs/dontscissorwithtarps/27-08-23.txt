<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: You should go stick your peepee in another boy and see what happens.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Fuck around and find out.
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kensei (The stark-eyed youth-UltimateHelper) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: They are no sensei of this Academy I am sure of that much.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Odd. I vaguely remember having 44 points before putting in points)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) shook their head. Unsure of what tragic turn the conversation might take next, and loath as they may be to do it. They stepped ligtly over to a bench and curled up into their bundles of clothing and bandages.

<font color = white>&#34;I shall rest a moment. It was an awfully long trip here.&#34;</font> they said supressing a yawn before drifting off for around thirty minutes</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: alright
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Womp womp.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: Also...can we all ignore that woman? is seems she wants to only make trouble here.
<br><font color=green>*Kokotaru (The blond bum-Luckynoob09) says:  (police chief look like skeeter but he still getting cooked

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) returned before heading to sleep. They knew better than most....proper protection came in numbers.

<font color = white>&#34;Here you are children. Play with these, someone must be responsible around here.&#34;</font> a laugh escaped from the bandaged mouth as they dumped several spinning stars with sharpened edges out</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Suichi (The uncouth youth-DontScissorWithTarps) says: Thank you friend
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) accepting the gift with a nod, pocketing it soon after.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) took the sharp star and put it away <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not a child..&#34;</font> He while still taking the gift anyways. No hint of shame.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: it is not much. But if crime really is bad in the big village then that should at least discourage a common bandit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) kicks a rock down the street, stopping at the comotion with a pique in interest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) cheered up somewhat with the gift. Shiny weapons were a step closer to getting strong!

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks, prey!&#34;</font> He shoved them into his pants irresponsibily.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That placement wont end well I am sure....as a matter of fact if anyone inquires I did not arm you.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I should lie?
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That can be useful. We are Shinobi, such a thing is a skill. In any case I am off to rest. good day
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I'm not a shinobi yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: Oh, man he going to be telling.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (gn though)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (night xD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) peers at the cloth man, his facial mask obscuring the parts of his face that would relay any emotions. He stares at the shuriken on the ground, before slowling bending over to pick it up.

He examines it brilliant shine, his finger tracing the edges of the blade. A small speck of blood would begin to protrude from his finger, as the sharp edge sliced his soft flesh.

He would place the shuriken into his cowl pocket.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Ahhh... if only i had enhanced smell)

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I won't tell! I can keep secrets, prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) 's steps were measured and deliberate as she approached the gathering of children. Her gaze remained fixed ahead, her eyes sweeping over the scene without a glimmer of interest. The chatter of the kids was a distant murmur, a background noise that held no sway over her thoughts.

Her features remained unchanged, her face an unmoving mask, as she walked closer to the group. Their voices rose and fell in a rhythm that didn't penetrate her consciousness. Shizuku's expressionless stare remained focused, her mind untouched by their words.

She was lost in a thick train of thought. Her mind set on her father's words and what they meant for her as a young Shinobi of a prominent clan. When the crowd was nearby, she stopped and fixated her stare on the people near her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Stain(The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) OOCs: [everyones profile looks fucked

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The Kids grin stretches across his face showing his razor sharp teeth. He looked between the people who showed him attention waving his hand back and forth at both of them.
 
 <font color = white>&#34;Hi! Are you students too!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) gave a slight nod to the male.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I can't wait to learn!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) Sticks a pinky up his nose digging for gold.
 <font color = white>&#34;WOAH! Really!? That means we can be best friends then!&#34;</font> He replies to the black haired youth.
 <font color = white>&#34;I want to learn too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) stood like a statue in place, her hands resting at her sides.

<font color = white>&#34;...I am to be in class on the first day. I have yet to see our instructors.&#34;</font> The girl mutters. Her left hand&#39;s index finger twitches as she casts her eyes between the kids talking.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) Removed a book from her pouch and quietly started to read it.

<font color = white>&#34;I have yet to see them as well.. &#34;</font> She had said flipping through a page on her small book.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I only saw him once! He came and went!
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Suichi has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The kid&#39;s pinky flicks a bugger from out his nose then after, he rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

 <font color = white>&#34;Hehehe, yeah! My papa said you have to kill the prey, always!&#34;</font> He shouted. Spinning around on his foot facing the crimson-haired-girl, he gazes at her book. <font color = white>&#34;Ohhhh! Is that a reading paper!? Whatcha readin best friend!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: No! Kill other prey, protect our prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) would shrug his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;Best friends? yea yea, sure whatever.&#34;</font>He said not really paying mind to it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times at the term best friend, the girl blinked a few more times before speaking. <font color = white>&#34;Fuuijinjutsu.&#34;</font> She said rubbing the side of her nose for a moment before going back to her study.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Hello everyone.
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Hey
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Hello prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0099cc>Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) Turns her head to look in the smelly boys direction.

<font color = white>&#34;Prey?&#34;</font> She questions.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Not me. I'm not prey?
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Never mind.
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: I wanted to see if anyone would like to go fishing with me.
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Guess not.
<br><font color=green>*Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm I could go fishing with you if you want.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0099cc>Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) shrugs her shoulders as it seemed everyone was day dreaming. Working hard on their statue style stance it seemed. Kind of sucked but then she heard someone speak up.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh alright just follow me.&#34;</font> She said, looking over at the Crimson haired girl</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: Whaaaa!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: I like fishies too!

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Yelling is what we do, prey!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) The lad came towards the group it seemed as though he&#39;s finally ran into some people within his village atleast people he actually notice.

After a back and forth yelling competition witht he gilly rock boy, hell look towards the guy giving a slight nod.

<font color = white>&#34;So What&#39;s your name?&#34;</font> He stated with his arms crossed.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would move over to the side, leaning up against the building as they would take out a book, looking at the others. <font color = white>&#34;So I take it we are all still waiting on the accademy? Though there are several new faces that I havent met yet it would seem.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Still waiting!
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: It happens I suppose
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The kid thinks for a moment. <font color = white>&#34;Uhhhhh... My name!?&#34;</font>
    The Gilly Rock boy had never given anyone his name!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The child makes a sad face, but he does realize how informal it was.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would look at Gilly rock boy. <font color = white>&#34;Yeesh I am not that old man, I am only fourteen...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) looked at Gilly for a second for a second skin as blue as the water he shrugged for a moment as he looked at the kid and then to Sora he started to wonder how the 14 years wasn&#39;t an genin.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh Interesting so we&#39;ll all behind haha, i join late too.&#34;</font> he stated as he prepared the path of becoming a ninja rather than being a cook like his dad.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: Yaw...hello guys
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would nod to the others, as he opened a book once more. <font color = white>&#34;Aye, hello as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) asks: I guess everyone waits for these teachers?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) looked at the black hair kid, <font color = white>&#34;Hey!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) To be fair, Gilly didn&#39;t know how old he was. Being only 4&#39;7 and having such soft fish features, one could assume he was anywhere between five and ten. Eitherway, he shrugs his shoulders grinning.
 <font color = white>&#34;Four and teen? That&#39;s pretty old!&#34;</font> 

 He looks over at E nodding. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re four and teen too!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: It was black haired girl which talked weird stuff like mating
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Was it Reimi?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled

<font color = white>&#34;They must have been pretty ugly for you to think they were a man.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
