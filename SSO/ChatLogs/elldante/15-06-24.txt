She paused as her eyes stared at the growing fubuki who was in first palce.

<font color = white>&#34;her body lowers at a 90 degree angle to allow the air current to pass her..from above.&#34;</font> 

<font color = white>&#34;the air..rose up at a angle to block the side lash of sand grains before rushing forwards.&#34;</font> She paused. <font color = white>&#34;hwoever..it was then...she was hit at her side..being  knocked back...you see...she is currently in the zone..but hasent fully entered it yet..&#34;</font>

She paused as she looked back to the blond lad and shook her head. 

<font color = white>&#34;they call it..the imperfect zone...baring into the doors..without being accepted fully by those already whom entered it. &#34;</font> She paused. <font color = white>&#34;its why Iroha is catching up to them...lets see if its not a fluke..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was in a different state of mind when he's.... Focusing. He didn't even acknowledge his new acquaintances' remark, his body simply reacting to the forces with no reply.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s listened to the offer given before taking a short breath. Just as she exhaled, her once somber demeanour had changed. Her eyes were piercing as she looked toward the boy.

Her once prim-and-proper way of speaking had vanished at the drop of a hat and she&#39;d tilted her nose up, even if she were shorter she found a way to still look down her nose at the boy. She almost seemed like a bit of a delinquent in the moment.</font></font></font>
