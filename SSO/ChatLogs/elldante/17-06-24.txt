<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Nah it was kinda fun. Gives people that worry about hand-to-hand a moment to shine. Which means those of us who aren't super good at it, will probably get our own time to shine later!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Im not great at that nii-san

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Which, proves my point. We're not good at hand-to-hand. We're good at other stuff. And we'll get our time in the spotlight later. Don't stress about it.

With that said...
     ...if they moved to attack or secure that retreating fellow, well, he was ready to assist in whatever inconsequential way he could. A pair of kunai found their way to his hands.

Hana continued to listen to the commanding man, her attention unwavering despite the discomfort gnawing at her. The mechanical timbre of his voice grated against her ears, and the sudden switch to a childlike tone sent a shiver down her spine, amplifying the unease she felt. Every word he spoke heightened the tension, making the entire situation increasingly unsettling for her.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) brought her knuckles to her chin as she observed quietly. Shuye's talents were lacking in this department. She was not particularly observant; she didn't have the uncanny ability to sense the energy in things her brother had, either. Worse, she was barely a genin, physically. No, explosive ordnance disposal was far beyond her capabilities.

She wouldn't have spotted them without another shinobi calling it out.

A traitor to the village, daring to come to the front gates...?

Was Iwagakure so weak?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) approached the scene, her eyes scanning over the crowd carefully before noticing someone outside of the gate-- Of course there was.

A sigh escaped her as she leapt overtop of the students, landing next to Chocho. Turning to face her for a moment, a smile is flashed, followed by a peace sign. She then finally turns her attention onto the stranger at their gates.
 <font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, she called out, looking him over from head to toe.

The camera in his eye was instantly spotted, alerting her to put her guard up. Perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps someone was actually coming to spy on them. Either way, it was work she didn&#39;t plan on having to deal with.
 <font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re just dropping stuff off, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font>, she began, her eyes looming over to the field behind him, noting the vast amount of explosive tags that were placed.

 <font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;know.. Someone has to clean those up, and it isn&#39;t gonna be me!&#34;</font>, she protested, venting another sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever.. If there&#39;s nothing else, then be on your way so I can find someone else to paw- I mean.. Delegate.. This task to...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

As she lay there, trying to catch her breath, doubts began to creep into her mind. Was she really built for this shinobi life?

Unless saved by the Chunin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would of course!...try her best to...block all the explosions!...by explanding her body and body blocking the exterance of the gaze!

She was now...super big...one arm went to the one arm went to the right. It was more to stop the shockwave from reaching them...taking on all of the force!

HOwever...as the smoke settled..she noticed that the commanding man was gone...high into the wind...maybe feelings..unfounded..mm..un found....she then waved her hand to clear the smoke residue...as she watched their now broken stair case...probably covered in crystals...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) vents a <i>massive</i> sigh as the explosive tags begin to detonate outwards in. Perhaps it was time for her to actually take this situation seriously.

 <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s like.. The uncoolest thing you could&#39;ve done, random dude.&#34;</font>, she protested. Her hands came together, weaving through a flurry of seals.

With a clap of her hands, the Shingen musters all of her Chakra into the air above the tags. <font color = white>&#34;Doton: Otoshibuta!&#34;</font>

From out of thin air, a massive lid forms, hovering over the field in front of the group. The surrounding area was of no concern to her, the wall was far too sturdy for any amount of explosive tags to take it down.. To an extent.

The shadow that loomed over all present only lingered for a moment before beginning to shrink at a rapid rate. Anyone who&#39;d not yet realized a giant lid spawned in the air would quickly notice as it began crashing down towards the ground, sealing in the impending explosion.
 <font color = white>&#34;Man.. One of these days I&#39;m gonna need to get paid more... This is getting ridiculous..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Yea. He sounded mechnical...Then like a child. All in one breath.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. His movements seemed a bit... mechanical.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nods in response. <font color = white>&#34;Looked like he was built, or rebuilt maybe.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches in awe as his superiors demonstrate some pretty awesome techniques.

<font color = white>&#34;That was awesome Koume! Kitsumi! Can you teach us how to do that?! I mean- Obviously not the body thing. But the giant lid thing?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wouldn't be surprised if he were rigged to explode as well.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: He didn't do something to the guards patrolling the wall and guarding the gate, did he?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) Daigen picked up a stack of bricks, feeling their rough texture and the weight of each one in his hands. He made his way to the damaged steps, where a gaping hole needed to be repaired. Kneeling down, he placed the first brick carefully, ensuring it was aligned correctly. With practiced precision, he applied mortar and set the next brick beside it. Each motion was deliberate, the rhythm of the task becoming almost meditative as he continued to lay down brick after brick.

As the hours passed, Daigen's focus remained unwavering. He meticulously aligned each brick, securing them with mortar, and making sure the structure was sturdy. Sweat dripped down his brow, but he ignored it, driven by the need to restore the steps for his village. By the time he placed the twenty-second brick, he took a moment to survey his work. The steps looked almost as good as new, each brick fitting seamlessly into place. The satisfaction of contributing to the village's recovery filled him with pride, knowing that he played a part in rebuilding what was lost.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaido(The troubleaker-EllDante) OOCs: (22 bricks)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Sakujak, Ryohei (The short-tempered youth-Kwaj874) decided to get started upon the strength training turned manual labor.

<font color = white>&#34;Chop chop he says.. t&#39;ch.. I guess it&#39;ll be good arm training if nothing else,&#34;</font> he says, deciding that it was time to lay the bricks. He began to do so, taking each bring within his hand to get a feel for their weight. They weren&#39;t too heavy, but he still began placing them down carefully in a straight line. It didn&#39;t take too long before his arms began to feel sore, but he was definitely feeling the strain.

He continues, finding that they still had quite a long ways to go, something that causes him to suck his teeth. He glances over at the multi-armed girl.

<font color = white>&#34;Oi.. we could use a hand here. Or four...&#34;</font> he says.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante)  wiped the sweat from his brow, his small hands caked with dirt and mortar. The midday sun beat down on him as he carefully laid another brick into place, ensuring it was perfectly aligned with the others. His fingers, though young, moved with surprising precision as he spread the mortar and set the brick down, tapping it gently to secure it. He glanced around at the work site, seeing fellow villagers and shinobi all contributing to the repair efforts. The once-devastated wall of the village was slowly but surely being rebuilt, and Kaido felt a sense of pride swell in his chest. This was his home, and he was helping to restore it.

With thirty-one bricks laid, Kaido paused to take a sip of water from his canteen. His mind wandered as he looked at the progress they had made. The destruction had been extensive, but the determination of the villagers was even greater. Kaido remembered the stories his parents had told him about the resilience of their people, and now he was experiencing it firsthand. He watched as an older shinobi guided a group of younger children in carrying more bricks to the site, and felt a renewed sense of purpose. Taking a deep breath, Kaido picked up another brick, ready to continue his part in the restoration of Iwagakure.

(31 Bricks laid)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) glances at the various bricks and pouts a little, guh she really was going to have to do this.  Wasn&#39;t she?  Well either way, her six arms would begin bundling up the bricks as sh ebegins to carry them over and stack &#39;em up.   Were they supposed to use cement?  She didn&#39;t know where there was cement to get!  Thus she&#39;d just focus on beginning to stack them up.  While others might be doing one or two at a time, she was moving six bricks at a time.  MANY ARM CLAN!

<font color = white>&#34;LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&#34;</font>

Yeah, Tsuneko was one hell of a vibe in and of herself!  The girl continued to work hard on grabbing up various bricks as she moves to stack them up, the six arms working in sync.  Yes, she was very skilled with her many many arms!  Either way, she&#39;d do her job of laying brick.

<font color = white>&#34;Heh.  Atleast it&#39;s not water pipes.  So we can&#39;t go, &#39;Hey ma I&#39;m laying pipe!&#39;  hahahaha.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

His father showing off his doton mastery was equal parts distracting and inspiring. While he himself couldn't do something like that yet; it did at least make him want to get this over with sooner.

If only to move one step closer to learning how to <i>do</i> that. At least the bricks on their own weren't particularly heavy or difficult to handle. It was just a lot of very tedious, mundane effort. And a lot of bending over. His back was going to be absolutely shot tomorrow...

At least it looked like they were finishing up. The combined efforts of four students, a golem, and an old man were apparently pretty efficient!</font></font></font>

A casual question&#39;s posed during the trip. Until...

In turn? He drives a speedy jab directly for the kid&#39;s sternum.
<font color = white>&#34;Not bad. I can tell you hit decent hard.&#34;</font>
Compliments paid where they were due, while he side steps a tad. Keeping both of his enemies within sight.
