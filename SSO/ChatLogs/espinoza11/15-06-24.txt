<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) leans back, both his palms against the bench.

Just taking a short break from my run, how about yourself?&#34;</font> He asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I'm not doing anything but thinking. It's my favorite hobby.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) chuckled to himself about what he had said like he did almost every time he said it. 

<font color = white>&#34;Train?&#34;</font> he uttered before turning his head to face the pale-eyed martial artist. 
<font color = white>&#34;I guess it is but I never see it as training. I just think that thinking is fun and nobody talks about it. Running and exercise aren&#39;t as fun to me. Sorry.&#34;</font> he said. <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your name by the way?&#34;</font> he asked</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) smirked to his response, taking his palms off the bench. He formed a T shape with his arms and began to stretch slowly, straining his muscles. <font color = white>&#34;Name&#39;s Matsu. Hyuuga, Matsu.&#34;</font>

The man who was clearly in his late 20&#39;s added, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the Head of the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) scratched the back of her head slowly. Glancing left and right slowly with a sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Anywhere with water, of course..!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed with much conviction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: Hm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) continued to stretch, switching arms now, <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your name, little one?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) looked over at the older man and tilted her head slightly. <font color = white>&#34;Yukigetsu, sir.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Greetings Yukigetsu! I am Matsu Hyuuga!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: I'll be one of your instructors this year if you're in the academy.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) says: Woah, the Hyuuga clan? That explains it.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: I'm the head of the clan, yes/

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) gives a deep and slow bow of respect towards his clan head, before taking a seat near by..

She flips her backpouch around and begins to fumble through some supplies.. In an disorganized and disheveled maner.

No words are spoken, only a pair of matte pale eyes that peek up ever so often.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Yukigetsu(The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) OOCs: (Ill logout for now. Will rp more 2morrow. Gnite.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) looks sideways to his fellow clan member, <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your name, young one?&#34;</font> He now stood from the bench and began to stretch out his legs.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) stops her rummaging through the pouch, zipping it closed once more and sliding it to the rear of her hip. 

<font color = white>&#34;Higane.. Master Matsu.&#34;</font> She replied with another soft bow of the head.

Respect, was indeed the name of the game.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (okay done with that)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Higane, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Are you enrolling in the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Yes M-master Matsu. I plan on making this year count.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: As I mentioned earlier to the youngsters, I will be one of your instructors this year!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Here, have these as a little pre-year studies!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Thats what I heard from my parents.. but I-I didn't believe it! This.. is soo coo---!...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Ahem.. thank you Master Matsu.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) reaches a hand into his open robes, and pulls out several small scrolls. He double checks he grabbed one of each before tossing them high into the air for the young Hyuuga to catch.</font></font></font>
<br>Hyuuga, Matsu is Hyuuga, Higane's new teacher for Henge no Jutsu
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) bows her head softly once again, accepting the scrolls sent her way.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: There's 2 more, but you'll get those a bit later when you have more experience moulding you chakra!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh.. this is alot of reading.. And yes Chakra control.. one of the things I was looking forward to learning more about.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) finishes stretching all him limbs and smiles widely as he looked around the square.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I'l do by due diligence and get these down to memory.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Have you awakened your Byakugan yet?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: ...Erm..is it okay to speak of this? --Apologies... You are our leader, if you say it, I will follow. No I have not.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: It's just my parents are more old school, ya know? They keep secrets.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I think my twin brother might have though... He's a genious compared to me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Worry not, for I am allowed to do whatever I like!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I am the strongest, and I am the best!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hello..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) turns his eyes to the newcomer, his pupil-less eyes finding him soon enough, <font color = white>&#34;Hey there!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: My brother is your biggest fan Master Matsu-- I mean not that I'm not---Er.. I mean.. Ahhh.... Hello there!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) awkwardly switches stance and faces the black haired male.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Sorry I closed the game by accident)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why are you fan of him?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Because!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He's the head of my fami--

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) flexes his muscles, his open robes giving an easier view. <font color = white>&#34;I am Matsu Hyuuga! I am here to insure you guys get stronger at all cost!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: but sir,im not...strong
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) jumps into the air, doing several acrobatic spins mid-air. With a heavy THUD, he lands right in front of the boy. He leans forward, invading his personal space and looked down on him from his great height. <font color = white>&#34;We can fix that for sure! The way to get stronger is to train!&#34;</font>

He suddenly pulled back and took a small hop back, and began to shadow box, <font color = white>&#34;The thing about training is training more!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: W-well....i apperiate the offer,but  after the academy finish i want to be not a martial artist
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But a medical ninja.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Then I can teach you in that regard to!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Huh..Medicine?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Didn't know you were medic ninja too..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: This is also my area of interest, what a twist of fate.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) swiftly produces several sets of shurinken with a flick of his wrist. In the blink of an eye, however,  they disappear. <font color = white>&#34;I am not one! But one of your teachers will be! I can teach you how to wield tools!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh..i can do that..somewhat.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) takes a few steps towards the black haired male and brings her right hand to her chin, her left slowly taps at her hip. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Higane, whats your name? Maybe we will be classmates!&#34;</font>

The girls eyes seem to light up at the mention of the medical arts.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (higane do me a favor and try to teach him a jutsu, I want to see if same-rank teaching is enabled)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will reveal one of the practice shurikens,made out of wood rather than steel.He was practising with it for a while.especally due to how his control of chakra traning was going on.He needed more and more of it,yet he feelt quite weak compared to most</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (Negative.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Ah damn okay, I gotta do it myself)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Najiro.And most likely we will be.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Najiro.. It's a cool nam-- Erm.. Any family or clan name of relevance? Wait.. is that rude to ask?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) taps her chin a few times with her finger, before relaxing her posture once again.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yakushi clan.But its not big as the ones in this village,its more of a family than a clan name
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) does a somersault towards the young man and invades his personal space once more. He peers down on him, looking down at him with a menacing face. After a second or two of intense starring he breaks into a wide smile and places several scrolls in his hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Read these!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Yakushi, Najiro.. Got it! I'm pretty good with names and faces--Woah! Where does he keep em all!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at the white haired male afterwhich they gave him several scrolls.It seemed the contents to be what the academy should teach him,so it was definatly legal to be given these.

Whoever,he only worried if perhaps was too early,afterall,The year just started of his academy lessons.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh,thats the material we will need to learn.Thank you sir.&#34;</font>He will say as he saved them at his small bag.We will definatly learn them,but for now? he decided that he needed time to learn other stuff</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) smiles and puts a finger to his lips while winking at Higane. If she looked closely she could JUST make out some black markings on his chest.</font></font></font>
