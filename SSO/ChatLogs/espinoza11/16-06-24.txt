<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) glances up to the individual, no doubt a shinobi in rights. He expected more to be joining in. A raspy and eerie voice breaks from his vocal cords, as if messed with to an extreme degree.

<font color = white>&#34;Greetings <b><i>young thing</b><b>...are you a higher-up within these walls? I’ve a message&#34;</font> he places the last of ten headbands onto the ground. <font color = white>&#34;Well....</b></i>a warning really<b><i>&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) tilted her head towards the scientist. She also noticed the plathora of headbands that lined the walkways behind him. Something was seriously off about this individual. The way he spoke...his movements and his overall vibe. 

<font color = white>&#34;Uhm...yeah I am.&#34;</font> the girl lied, hoping that giving off the illusion of her being more competent than a simple academy student might thwart off the threat of an attack.

<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) arrives at the scene and immediately drops down to the water below. His eyes change shape, the veins in his eyes becoming more pronounced. Even as he remained out of sight, he kept the scene above him in examination.

This was the perfect chance to get information on the enemy and the strenght of the new students, he seemed prepared to dash through the bridge itself with his pure muscular body at any opportunity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) arrives to the area. He stayed behind and simply observed. It had to be serious to warrant backup.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) seemed to be <b><i>very different</b></i> upon close examination. Organs in the wrong places, a chakra system that would make no sense and bursted with activity. Reserves massive in size, with a strange aura that couldn’t be placed correctly with what knowledge lay in hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I repesent the Dakuteika, before me are some...items we <i>procured</i>. And also a warning.

Well....I hate to see the living become something....else&#34;</font>

He seemed to be unarmed, but begins moving forward to the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;I wonder how many of you can stay locked up in here, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) eyes the blonde girl with a smirk</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to be put off by the figure's strange innards and is immediate in his change of tactics. He sneaks around from underneath, trying to jump out from behind him to pincer the man.

He stops just before jumping out as other people react.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) lets her instincts take over and hops back a few meters, growning the distance between her and the alleged intruder once again.

What could she do? The higher ups were present, she had no weapons..

Instead she just focused her self on what she could do.. Scrutinizing the indivudal from top to bottom, her eagle eyes keenly locking onto any unsual properties or hidden gimicks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look and begin to read the indivitual&#39;s lips,he was not chakra sensitive so he cannot feel any disturbance,but it was clear this guy was not good news.

<font color = white>&#34;Young bodies...but for what.&#34;</font>He will ask,while somewhat trying to think why they needed their bodies,a bodies of some beginer genins</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) &#39;s face twisted in disgust as he examined the strange scientist&#39;s figure and heard his words. &#39;The fuck?&#39; he thought. As his eyes scanned the blonde girl, he got a very uneasy feeling. He decided to take a defensive stance, just in case.

<font color = white>&#34;What the hell?&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) moving to get in front of the rest he would use himself as a shield to deflect any attacks coming.

<font color = white>&#34;Get back everyone.&#34;</font>

Seeing His partner go on the offensive he would do the same. Watching to make sure the students did not do anything risky he would prepare to use a jutus on the enemy if he moved to attack the students.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: What the heck is this?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as he took in the scene before him. The strange scientist with his unsettling presence and the scattered headbands spoke of a dangerous situation. His mind raced, assessing the potential threat and calculating his next move. Despite the scientist's eerie demeanor and the implied threat, Sogeki's stance remained firm and his expression unreadable, masking any fear or concern beneath a veneer of cold resolve.

He knew that action would be required, but for now, Sogeki chose to observe, gathering crucial information and waiting for the right moment to strike. His hand subtly moved towards a concealed weapon, prepared for any sudden developments. In the face of uncertainty and danger, Sogeki's instincts honed in, ready to protect himself and his comrades from whatever this mysterious threat might bring.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) stared at the scientist blankly for several moments, the unnerving intensity in his eyes making her deeply uncomfortable. There was a disturbing aura about him, a level of psychosis that was palpable and chilling.



     As a nervous tick, she ran her fingers through her golden locks while her gaze never wavered  as she regarded the bizarre individual who had just issued a dire warning.



<font color = white>&#34;So, let me get this straight,&#34;</font> she began, her tone laced with sarcasm and a hint of defiance. <font color = white>&#34;If we venture into the wilderness, you&#39;re planning to abduct us and transform us into some sort of grotesque and depraved creature such as yourself? Is that what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</font>

She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper,  ashs he  mockingly stated. <font color = white>&#34;Because if that&#39;s your idea of a threat, you might want to reconsider your approach.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) begins to shift and rattle. What seemed to be skin and bone was flipping and turning, to reveal a number of mechanisms. His back and arms twist and fold, and his body launches to the side with a number of mechanical creaks.

His head twists around in a three-hundred and sixty degree spiral before it swivels to face the two true Jonin. The body pieces separate and folding, allowing him to immediately slip out of the grasp of the incoming tackle.

<font color = white>&#34;We seek information, but not at the cost of warning. I’ve not come to attack, today, I’m nothing more than an embassy for words today&#34;</font>

The water off to the side begins to ripple, only noticeable by those with attuned senses or abilities such as a Byakugan. While another presence couldn’t be seen though, it could be felt. A chakra system very vaguely seen, almost as if invisible but not.

<font color = white>&#34;Power doesn’t lie in your village, it lies with us. Keep this...&#34;</font> he glances to the two Jonin, <font color = white>&#34;in mind, kids.&#34;</font> He begins to pull off, backing up from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;I bring your missing headbands as a gesture. Now, assuming you want to keep them and your lives, I think I’ll be going...&#34;</font> his beady, glass eyes, looking back and forth between the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;And if not, then we could all just...<b><i>go</b></i>&#34;</font> he begins to launch manically as he cast his eyes down to the bridge.

A bridge lined up with hundreds of explosive tags. <font color = white>&#34;If you catch my drift&#34;</font> one of the eyes winks. <font color = white>&#34;But you won’t have time to battle me and save them&#34;</font> A hand begins to form into a symbol, priming the tags but not setting them off.with only a matter of seconds at hand, would the perpetrator find battle? Or would the kids find rescue?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Shion! Protect!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) looked left, then right. Blinked a few times and quickly realized she was in a situaiton way above her pay grade.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhhh...oh SHIT! RUN!&#34;</font> she exclaimed before cartoonishly scamping northwards towards the end of the bridge before she was turned into a living firework.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) is an academy student for a week. He can't be killed..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) quickly scanned the area and took note of his colleagues. He felt an ominous presence but couldn&#39;t quite make it out. As one of the scientist&#39;s hands began forming a symbol, his heart dropped. For a split second, he felt frozen before his adrenaline dumped. <font color = white>&#34;We need to GO!&#34;</font> he said, trying to stir the others to action.</font></font></font>

His instincts kick in sharply. With a quick assessment of the surroundings and the looming danger, he darts to the side, his movements swift and agile as he attempts to evade the potential blast radius.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</font> Sogeki mutters under his breath, adrenaline coursing through him. He doesn&#39;t engage with the scientist directly, realizing the immediate need to prioritize the safety of himself and the others. His mind races with thoughts of escape routes and strategies to mitigate the imminent threat without escalating the situation further.

As he moves swiftly away from the danger zone, Sogeki&#39;s gaze flickers back towards the scientist and the assembled Jonin. His expression is a mix of frustration and determination, knowing that the situation has escalated beyond a mere confrontation. With a resolve to regroup and strategize further, he gestures urgently for the others to follow suit, seeking cover and safety from the unfolding chaos.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) jumps forward, placing himself behind the grotesque form before him, threatening to hurt the new generation of shinobi. The Hyuuga was a proud man, believing himself to be the strongest- but he was not foolhardy enough to assume he could both protect and attack at the same time.

In times like this, Matsu knew he could rely on the blessed vessel of the tailed beast. He relinquished all thought of defence and went on an immediate offence. He landing with a heavy thud, poised to attack.

A fraction of a second passed.

A large circle seemed to appear below him and the soon-to-be corpse. Before that very same second ended, Matsu had began a flurry of blows.

<font color = white>&#34;Juukenho!&#34;</font> He shouted, as he delivered two blows. Immediately he delivered 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64 blows! <font color = white>&#34;Hakka Hyaku Bijuhanaho!&#34;</font>

Fire overtakes the bridge and begins to crack the foundation as the force brings it in from itself and erupts outwards.

The very ground everyone is standing on begins to cave and quake, leaving nothing but rough terrain not easily crossed to scamper away from. The attacker would rock the puppet’s pieces, only to find the deformed body of a young child inside - his fists now digging into a thin young sternum and lifeless corpse.

The body itself, blowing up once it had been breached. Leaving the attacking Hyuuga with moderate injuries from the resulting explosion.

Papers reign down from above after smoke clears - with a singular message <b><i>we are already here.</b></i> Each of the students just barely scraping by with nothing more than minor injuries as they’re protected from the resulting explosions by their commanders. 
After all that’s left - nothing but splinters and chunks of a young boy’s body remain. The hyuuga’s palms soaked in the child’s blood. A child of Amegakure - a Genin, no less.

The expert use of the water jutsu saved the students from most of the despair, with nothing but be try minor injuries as a result

The muscular man tries to shield his face but is blasted backwards. He has enough sense to force a roll and lands on one knee, bleeding from various cuts- and his own hands covered in someone else&#39;s blood.

He stands, realizing the attack was over. He spits the saliva and blood from his mouth, not seeming to care that he just battered a child&#39;s corpse.

<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: that is good I am glad the academy students are so well prepared for recovery.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) the normally very energetic and kind man seemed to have taken a serious and sadistic demeanor in the heat of battle. He continued on, one leg lagging behind.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Put the body inside the hospital..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Then let the kage see and...perhaps search for any info about that group

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: You all better stay in the village for now. Let the strong warriors deal with this.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Some psychopaths are doing weird science experiments on us. We have to remain on guard.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Oh no.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well Senju girl.We founded out some group kidnaps young genins and make them into their soldiers

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) gestures toward the body of the felled genin with a solemn expression.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) remained silent as he carefully observed the jounin. Playing close attention to the rhetoric being used, the boy would assess each and every word uttered. Though hw was no where new the jounin's level of combat, Kryu was prepared to give his life should need be. Though it went undetected, the academy student would shift his left foot enough to form a fluid stance, should he be forced to engage in combat. 

Remaining silent he continued to eye the figures on the bridge, absorbing as much information as possible despite the lack of context in their coded-language. Should any of the senior shinobi take notice, the boy was display many analylitical skills commonly displayed by interrogators. 

Retaining as much information as possible, the child continue to make mental notes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) blinked, she remained distant from site, her eyes were down, however, she seemed to be more concerned about the damages dealt to the infrastructure of the build than anything else, though soon enough her eyes rose up to scan over the rest.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) points to the mess of body and puppet parts behind him with his thumb to offer context to those arriving late.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) after sharing her supplies with Najiro and tending to the simple cuts and bruises of any nearby individuals who accepted their aid, Higane backs off the shaky broken bridge, carefully making her back into a more secure foothold.

<font color = white>&#34;Not much we could do there really.&#34;</font> She simply comented, dusting off her kimono.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Rose...do you got anything you want to do as shinobi
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And Higane? im sure after your traning with them you will return stronger.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: the right thing is now to get stronger...and when we strong enough to attack whoever caused this
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Is it though..?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I mean it is what we signed up for, I get that.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afterall...you one of the noble clans.If feel there is no solution to what you seek,then perhaps with the time it will reveal itself to you
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case....we need to do something about...all of this.Even if is not just fighting,we can improve our medical capabilities aswell
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But the best thing? is maybe to finish the academy year...and then find out what to do next.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) slowly walked over some of the broken bridge&#39;s jagged edges, pushing herself over a few larger chunks until she made her way next to the plaid eyed girl. 

She didn&#39;t really speak her way, or try to make eye contact in any way, she just rested against a larger chunk of the collapsed bridge. <font color = white>&#34;Thats not what I mean, exactly-- Forget it..&#34;</font>

She paused to ponder, bringing a hand up to her chin. <font color = white>&#34;Mhm.. it&#39;s going to be a long year, now that we&#39;ve seen first hand whats to come.&#34;</font> She&#39;d add, slowly releasing a long winded sigh.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) blinked, she side looked at the one who approached her, an eyebrow arched softly, before she&#39;d turn her eyes towards the martial artist again. <font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;d you ask if anyone was a Hyuuga here?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: For now though,im going back to my place.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) reaches into his open robes and pulls out what seems to be an endless amount of scrolls, handing them out to everyone who seemed in need of basics.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa8c5a>Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) reaches a hand to snatch the scroll from the air.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to have black markings in his chest where he pulled out the scrolls.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) looks at him immediately. The protruding veins on his eyes making him seem a lot more menacingly.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to instantly snap into his happy-go-lucky attitude, making the disparity of his two personalities give an uncomfortable feeling.</font></font></font>
