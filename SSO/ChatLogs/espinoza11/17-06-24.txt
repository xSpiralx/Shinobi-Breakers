<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Many kiddos asleep!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yuuu~p. Seems like it's 'round that time.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: It's...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: You all outta be training!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Way way WAY past my bedti-
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: WE BUILT A BRIDGE AND YOU WANT US TO **TRAIN?**
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Tchhhh...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would look over to the martial artist. Blinking all of the while. <font color = white>&#34;Training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I guess a shinobi's work is never done.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) flexes his muscles, his opened robes displaying his chest and abdomen. The clearly older man with pupil-less eyes seemed to be smiling brightly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: You must be one of the Chuunin.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Chuunin?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Mmmm, no you're right. You're much too old to be a Chuunin. you're our Jounin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) reeled his head back, placing his palms against his belly, and let out a loud guffaw.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I am the one!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: The only!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Hyuuuuga, Matsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I am the strongest there is!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Oh- You're the guy who stopped the bridge getting blown up more, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Yep!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I beat up that puppet so hard!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would hold his chin thinking on it, <font color = white>&#34;I always imagined you&#39;d have the same kind of dark hair of the hyuuga. You must have seen something so terrifying it dyed your hair white.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I actually used to be bed-ridden as a child! You could say I saw myself dying daily! So I must always keep training!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hoooh, interesting, I must say.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Maybe that's why my hair is also white, I might've been sickly
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: We gotta train that sickness out of you!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: I'd say I'm preeetty buff for right now, but I plan to get even stronger!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to be unwrapping his belt from around his middle.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Oh so you think you're buff huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: WELL TRAINING BEGINS NOW!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: N.. not as buff as yo--.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Eh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) launches his belt at the boy. The belt was deceivingly long, reaching all the way from where Matsu stood to where the shark-ish boy was caught off guard.

The belt wrapped around the boy's body and restricted all movement unless he was somehow able to dodge the attack.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oi, oi! Don't- Don't whap my cousin with a belt, just because OUR clan head isn't here doesn't mean tha-
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oh man...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) drops the skill immediately after.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (you can RP the few seconds of the wrap)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Because I am not sealing a genin)
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Oh that seems like a jutsu I might want to look into.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he would see the other launch a spare bolt of cloth from their clothing. Watching the belt wrap around them. He would huh quietly, <font color = white>&#34;That is some quick clothe right there.&#34;</font>&#34; </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) The eyes of the boy flashed open as the cloth came and immediately wrapped around him. The life of this twelve year old breezed through his mind. All. Twelve. Years. By the time he had finished reliving every moment - the cloth  had returned back to its owner, seemingly. 

        Whilst others would be wary or on edge - Jinbeisame was.. surprisngly wholehearted. His arms pumped as he relives on that moment that played on him momentarily. 

     <i><font color = white>&#34;That was soooo~ cool..! I want that technique, man! Though, I doubt I&#39;ll ever try and learn it for now..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) wraps the belt back around himself, nodding all the while. When his robes are once more fully secured around his waste, he folds his arms one over the other and puffs out his muscular chest.

<font color = white>&#34;You should never assume you are not in danger at every possible moment! You should always strive to be the strongest, like me!&#34;</font> He would then look around to the nearby students, hoping to have impressed them.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I am a master at many arts!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Once you all graduate I shall pass on some of my secrets!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: You should see what I can do to people who can use elemental ninjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: What kind of arts interest you all?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I am interested in Elemental ninjitsu, as well as throwing weapons.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Though I am following a clan herritage.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I can demonstrate a shurinkenjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oh, right. I forgot to fill out that form.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Later, I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: A clan huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Which do you come from?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (back mb)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) took a glance back at the soft-featured boy, then at the Hyuuga. Then, back at the boy. And back at the Hyuuga. Once more, at the boy. And then, at the Hyuuga. 

<font color = white>&#34;... Really?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Yes!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink up at him, with a short bow from them. <font color = white>&#34;I am from the Yuki Clan, I believe Saigosame is making a note on my appearance being rather... Typical for my clan.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Man.. Y'got lucky, I could'a for sure broke out of that, maybe..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Though, I do plan on tailoring up some fine things for myself to wear. Maybe something in red? Blue would be very stereotypical.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean- I'm not one to judge, I'm blue. But the hair, the pale, fair skin, the soft jawline and the big, doe-like eyes were a bit of a giveaway.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) was standing there, perfectly still. The next moment, he had appeared infront of the half-shark boy. A trail of kicked up dirt could be spotted the base of the two spots he travelled between.

He looked down from his superior height and gave a sickly sweet smile, <font color = white>&#34;Want to try a harder one?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) answered dead fast.

<font color = white>&#34;N-.&#34;</font>

<b><i>He already closed the damned distance.</b></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) began to lift a finger to cast a sign, but stopped. <font color = white>&#34;Hm... Perhaps you&#39;re not brave enough!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Sup.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) placed his hands along his waist, his chest poking out. Whether it be a sense of bravado, or simply not wanting to look like a coward in front of the crowd, he shook his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Give it y-your best shot, bwahaha..ha..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Going to judge you forever Saigosame.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: there will be a day, when you are a tall gruff shark man.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: and you say outloud, 'I love fish sticks'
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: and I will stare wordlessly at you infront of your genin squadron.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Eh? I mean. I don't know, maybe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) pushed his head back and gaffawed once more. <font color = white>&#34;Attaboy!&#34;</font> He exclaimed, raising only one hand before forcing his chakra to the student before him.

At once, the ground around both of them seemed to be decorated in black markings- connecting the two of them. The boy would feel immense pressure on himself, glueing him to the spot and stopping any limb movement save for his mouth.

(B+ Power)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) simply stopped walking down the bridge as she watched the scene unfold, the girl blinked, deciding to simply shrug upon the sight of the death delievering Matsu was just practicing.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp, he&#39;s dead.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Any sense of affirmation was quickly absorbed. Being praised for his courageous spirit - or pute stupidity, you choose - Jinbeisame stood still, and stood proud. Well, it wasn&#39;t like he had <i>much choice</i>.

Given the time to perform their next feat, the half-shark was frozen in place. Completely unmoving. Whilst his mouth retained its former motor functions - leaving him the ability to grunt whilst trying to regain his posture.

<font color = white>&#34;Th&#39;hell.. Is.. This..?! I&#39;m <b><i>frozen</b></i> of all things?! This is so disorientating but so.. coool~..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) released the sealing barrier and then slapped the boy HARD on the back. <font color = white>&#34;You did great! What&#39;s your name kiddo?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (i say hard but str is my dump)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) watches from the side as he watches the sealing jutsu. A little Oooo leaving him. He leans to the side a little as he begins to think on that. Sealing people in place.... freeezing them in place. Perfectly perserved.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stumbled forward, his face shining with a new light before looking up towards the figure. The thumb of the boy jabbing at himself.
            <i><font color = white>&#34;Why, I am Jinbeisame of the Hoshigaki Clan! Though, like my sleeping blonde friend, y&#39;can call me &#39;Beisame!&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Hoshigaki? Wow! I couldn't tell!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) did not seem to be sarcastic.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) nodded proudly.

<font color = white>&#34;Right?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Got t'be the hair, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Or something about the eyes!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Ah! Maybe, maybe!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Anyways! Someone here mentioned shurinkenjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Would you like to see a technique you could realistic learn after graduation, or perhaps something a bit more advanced?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: No takers it seems!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Oooh.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: SHow me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Alright! Mika, would you like realistic or advanced?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) tilts her head, she brings her hand up to her cheek, scratching it gently. <font color = white>&#34;Realistic.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would nod as he leans over thinking on that, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d be fine with seeing both realistic, and advanced....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: Aye why not both?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) removes the upper part of his robes, taking his arms out of the sleeves and letting the cloth fall down below his waste. His body was muscular as one would expect, but around the chest and ribs, several back markings decorated his skin. He pressed his hand against one near his armpit, and a puff of smoke was produced.

When the smoke cleared, he was holding a set of three shurinkens, he flipped them like one would a coin across his knuckles. <font color = white>&#34;Pretty standard run-of-the-mill throwing stars no?&#34;</font> He asked, smiling brightly. <font color = white>&#34;Well see if you can dodge this!&#34;</font>

He winked as he threw the high-speed shurinkens at Mikazuki!

The girl would have time to react before they seemingly missed her and went around her- though she would see the trick coming up if she had superior eyesight. A second of peace later, he pulled back his arm, ensaring the girl in wires.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki(The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) OOCs: (what speed this is coming in?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Uh for sake of roleplay, C+ if no sight, or E if sight)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) blinks, the girl widened her eyes as she witnessed Matsu summon ninja tools out of a seal in his body, she tilted her head a tad bit, the girl saw the Shuriken coming her way, the speed of the projectiles clearly made her surprised. Plaid eyes scan across the objects as she quickly goes inwards, advancing against the thrown weapons, she dashed forth in order to no longer be a standing target, so the trajectory of the projectiles would shift.

Though shrolled forward quickly in an attempt of dodging the weapons. <font color = white>&#34;Ugh!&#34;</font>

She immediately got up after the weapons passed away, though- As she got up and looked past the shuriken going forth in their normal trajectory, she&#39;d feel a strange, tangling wire wrapping about her torso.

Her arms were glued together right after quite immediately and she&#39;d find her arms restricted-

<font color = white>&#34;HEH?! OH WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) watches the other whip a flurry of shurriken out! He would watch as they would pull at the wires. He even didn&#39;t see them initially. An impressed, &#39;Ooooo&#39; leaving the boy as he watches them weave and change trajectories! Wrapping about the girl suddenly. <font color = white>&#34;Very neat!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) released his grip on the wires, releasing the young Hyuuga from the imprisonment. When the wires fell to the ground at her feet, Matsu slowly pulled them along with the shurinken back towards him, coiling it.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s Ayatsuito, really handy when people move around too much for you to hit em.&#34;</font>He then produced a small scroll and placed the weapons in the center. A flash of smoke appeared, and the weapons were now gone- leaving behind only the scroll with a different pattern written on it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Putting them back on my torso is a pain, but I wanted to show off a bit!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I'll have to restock that later!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Ha, certainly showing off.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I'm going to need a lot of senbon the more I think about it..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: They get expensive fast!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I have something planned for you all in a couple months!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I'll get Botan and Shion to help me show you all what a real battle is like!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) puffed his chest out, <font color = white>&#34;I wager I can take on BOTH of them on at the same time!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) spun as the wire was pulled like in a cartoon, on her own axis. She stopped on a perfect straight position as she was forth and glared Matsu like nothing has happened.

<font color = white>&#34;...Ooh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) stretched out, <font color = white>&#34;Well I should go hit the sack! I have an early mission tomorrow! But I will be around and about a bit later in the day!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
