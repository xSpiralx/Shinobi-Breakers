<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) says: Oh. Oi, Cuz.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) unwraps his belt from around his middle. His robes stayed tightly around his body, perhaps something else was holding it in place.

The belt was deceivingly long, the students around him would notice. He held on to one end of the fabric while he tossed the other end forward towards Sogeki, the material seemingly stretching as it headed towards it's target.

The belt would begin to wrap around Sogeki, tightening in a second and restraining all movements but speech.

He would release the bind before it became permanent the following turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Hana was looking for you, you speak to her yet or nah?
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Yeah, I got faith in you both. I just wanna see that uppity little dick get his ass kicked.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Thinks he's better than everyone, tch...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Matsu, the Hyuuga martial artist, unwrapped his deceptive belt from around his waist, Sogeki observed with a keen, calculating gaze. The fabric seemed unnaturally long, hinting at hidden abilities or techniques beyond its mundane appearance. Sogeki remained outwardly composed, though his mind analyzed the unfolding situation with meticulous detail.

As Matsu tossed one end of the belt towards him, Sogeki noted the fluid motion and the controlled extension of the fabric. The belt surged forward, the material stretching unnaturally as it closed the distance between them with surprising speed.

The fabric wrapped around Sogeki swiftly, tightening with a suddenness that restricted his movements but allowed him to speak. He felt the constricting pressure against his body, a calculated move by Matsu to assert control and limit his freedom momentarily.

Maintaining his calm demeanor, Sogeki subtly wiped his palm against his vest, smearing a thin layer of sweat from his skin onto the fabric. It was a small, tactical move—preparing himself mentally and physically for any further developments in the encounter.

While outwardly restrained, Sogeki's focus remained sharp and unwavering. His eagle-like vision scanned the surrounding area, assessing the reactions of the students and bystanders. He remained alert for any sign of aggression or opportunistic movement, his mind calculating potential threats and strategies with cool precision.

Despite the temporary restraint, Sogeki's eyes conveyed a silent warning to those around him—a reminder of his readiness to respond swiftly and decisively to any challenge. His posture remained relaxed yet poised, a testament to his training and experience as a shinobi who thrived in moments of controlled chaos.

As Matsu prepared to release the binding, Sogeki awaited the moment with a measured patience, ready to assess the situation and determine his next course of action. The encounter had tested his resolve and adaptability, reinforcing his reputation as a shinobi who navigated challenges with calculated precision and unwavering focus.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) walked up to the volunteer and adopted a fighting stance. He looked ready to deliver the Hyuuga's famous open palm blows. He pulled his right back back at the hip level, building momentum. However, instead of an open palm, he curled his fingers forwards resembling a grasping motion.

To those looking at his hand, they would see each finger glow a menacingly purple color in turn - starting with the pinky. In a swift strike, he would slam the fingers into the Hoshigaki's middle.

The blow did not seem to hurt the boy, he could feel something was OFF about him.</font></font></font>

However...

It barely moved the Hoshigaki, simply inching them back half a stepas the shark blinked in confusion. They peered down at their body from under that large straw hat, then back up at the Hyuuga, then back down, and back up once more.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m... Not entirely sure what that did, but it did <b>something</b>.&#34;</font>, they remarked, moving their arms, their legs, rolling their neck - Something was off, but they couldn&#39;t quite figure out what just yet.

<font color = white>&#34;... Nothing&#39;s happening. I&#39;m <b>positive</b> I weaved them correctly... It&#39;s...&#34;</font>

Their brow furrowed for a moment, before widening in shock.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (my advise is if you go for shurrikenjutsu to interrupt have speed enough to evade

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (it's only 7 points, it gives you +3 inventory slots, and you can throw two tools per round instead of one

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (Even if you're not a shurriken build, you always want to spend resources to win, and shurriken throwing is a damage resource)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (though tbh you could spend 9 points and get +6 instead of +3
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (but that's on you
