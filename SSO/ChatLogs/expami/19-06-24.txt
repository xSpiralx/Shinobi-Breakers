<font color = white>&#34;Nevermind.. Well, this old man is here to make some market research, how do you kids feel about purcharsing fancy clothing?&#34;</font> he asks, taking out a notebook and a pen.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: ... What now?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) nods, obviously having heard the wrong words due to his aged hearing.
<font color = white>&#34;So you need clothes because you are cold? I see.. so functionality over design..?&#34;</font> he mumbles as he takes some notes.
It was clear that if someone wished to convey their words, then they would either need to shout or talk fro REALLY close.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) taps his notebook as he waits for more feedback on the idea of purchasing fashion clothings. <font color = white>&#34;Anyone else wants to share their opinion? It&#39;s rare for an old man like myself to listen to the opinion of you ducklings.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Are you a blacksmith or something?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shanin(The black haired teen-Toopher2) OOCs: (If their at 50+ they shouldn't be normal characters lol)
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Oh hello there again!
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) asks: Hows your horse?
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: I am a merchant young boy.. and hello Sha-chan, Donut is doing well. He just hates the rain so he's hiding away
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: I see! Well I hope donut has gotten lots of pats.
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: He was a very pretty boy after his cleaning.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) put away the notebook as he realized that none of the kids had an opinion to share.. either because they were shy, or because they didn&#39;t know the true value of being dripped the fuck out.
<font color = white>&#34;Seems like it might be too early for questions.. I&#39;ll come back later. Be a darling Sha-chan, and ask your young friends if they would be interested in the prospect of purchasing designer clothes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Ohoh.. yes, Donut is quite the handsome donkey. He has a few mares back at home
