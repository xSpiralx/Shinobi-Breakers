<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think so. I&#39;m not--&#34;</font> How could she best explain this without raising suspicion on herself? It was clear after looking at Shuye for a few seconds that her features were slightly different from those around her. Like she wasn&#39;t from around here; a foreigner.

<font color = white>&#34;...You were compliment me, okay.&#34;</font> Shuye finally seemed to relax a little. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you, I guess. I like your hairstyle.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) recognized the name. <font color = white>&#34;A couple people have been talking about you.&#34;</font> She remembered at the visit to Akihabara, the girl had initially shown interest in being made into a plushie. Unlike Shuye though, she didn&#39;t have interest in playing the game to be the winner of that privilege. Shuye is hesitant, but does carefully reach out to grip her hand.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) grit those teeth.
The Adversary had endured the full blunt of his weight thrown into that knee.
And then?! Used themselves like a missive, driving a kick for his center. 

Katora raised arms in defense, catching that dropkick against the bony oversides of his arms and finding himself sliding back over the stone tiles. It was heavy. Unexpectedly heavy for someone of their size. 

Enough to leave lingering pain in his flesh, following that defense. He pushed back, no doubt sending them to their feet. A snappy twist sent his shin scything in for the kid&#39;s ribs! 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re tougher than you look. And you hit hard. A Martial Artist, huh?&#34;</font>

There was no hope for dislodging any ribs. Hell, he couldn&#39;t pull that off with a simple kick anyway. It got fended off by their arm almost too easily. 

Next came a twin pair of fists, daring to spike him into the floor like a nail to a wooden plank. Can&#39;t have that! A duck transitions into a full dive. A roll! He wheels off his shoulder into a knelt position. The haymaker of a blow just barely grazed his blond locks. 

From there?! He shoots a jab for the kid&#39;s kidneys-- 
Nope. A Feint. He tried to fake him out, creating an opening to dart away for some breathing room. 

<font color = white>&#34;And it&#39;s not even your specialty. Insane.&#34;</font>

[C- Agi again!]

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Hana leaned forward and took a closer look at Venturo. To her surprise, he was much closer than she had initially thought. With a friendly smile, she decided to introduce herself.

<font color = white>&#34;Hi there! I&#39;m Kohana,&#34;</font> she said, extending her hand warmly. <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t realize you were so close by. It&#39;s nice to meet you, Venturo!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;What a unique name as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hehe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) maintained her handseal while being teased by Hideo. Suddenly her gaze intensified while she stared at the red-headed boy. At this point she reeled her head backwards while drawing in as much oxygen as she could to fill her lungs. Her chest heaved outwards due to the sudden intake. All the while she allowed her chakra to intertwine her fire-natured chakra within her lungs. Another five handseals were formed, completing the sequence until finally, she pulled said hands apart. Her fingers coiled around her pursed lips to act as a funnel.

<font color = white>&#34;Fireball Jutsu!&#34;</font> she thought.

A dim orange hue illuminated Reilin&#39;s face as she spewed the life an orb of flames... Truthfully, the fireball she released was pitiful to say the least. It barely reached out a foot in diameter. Hardly comparable to the size of even her head, and she was a petite teenager. Just as quickly as the flame was produced, it had dissipated.

Reilin held her stance long after the &#39;technique&#39; was released.

She blinked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) blinks. His arm rises up just in case, body leaning backwards away from the area as they called out their &#39;attack&#39; of sorts. He looks a bit hesitantly, though finds a bit more courage once the spouted flames spat out were nothing but. . .

Lighter fluid. <font color = white>&#34;Hah, worried for nothing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) is absolutely crying on the inside. He couldn&#39;t believe it. He&#39;d said hey twice, and then all of a sudden because Shuye&#39;s got the cool hair, he&#39;s now being noticed? While thankful for his good pal, he can&#39;t help but feel as though his usual charm truly had found someone it&#39;d be ineffective on. 

BUT...

<font color = white>&#34;Hi!&#34;</font> he cheers again, reaching his hand out to shake Kohana&#39;s. She&#39;d find there to be an object placed between the two of their hands though as they met. When did he sneak that in there?  <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s me. Yep. Venturo. Nice to meet you too, Kohana. My name is legendary I think... yours is pretty too. Just like...!&#34;</font>

After giving her hand a firm shake, he releases her hand. Should she look to her palm, she&#39;ll see a decently sized pebble in its place, with a sort of royal blue mixed in with a few cerulean swirls in it.

<font color = white>&#34;This rock!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) intently watches Reilin&#39;s theatrical attempt. It was, of course, a lot better than he could do all things considered. But it was still pretty rough. Especially after all the build-up behind it.

His face scrunches up as he clearly tries to avoid laughing. As funny as this display was, it was equally impressive. So he really didn&#39;t want to lose his composure and mock her or anything. But it was an uphill struggle...

After a few moments of stifled chuckles he sighs. Taking a deep breath to calm himself down before he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Woooow that was suuuuper impressive Reilin. I think you&#39;ll actually be able to make me to sweat in... a couple of years.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) acts natural, manuevering to face his opponent with a fluid twist of his body. The boy would perform a low cross-block to halt the attack that would hit his kidney, or abdominal region in this case - following up shortly after with a basic hinge kick which would be aimed towards Katora&#39;s clavicle.

  If any attempt to move away were made, of course Yurei was hot on his tracks!

<font color = white>&#34;I feel great!&#34;</font> He announced to the world, as if it had asked of him his condition.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you again, Venturo,&#34;</font> she said, a touch of skepticism in her voice as she examined the pebble. <font color = white>&#34;Pretty as a rock, huh? Well, that&#39;s a new one.&#34;</font>

She took a deep breath, deciding to give him the benefit of the doubt. 

<font color = white>&#34;By the way, my full name is Kohana Hoshino. It means &#39;little flower in a field of stars.&#39; Quite a contrast to a pebble, wouldn&#39;t you say?&#34;</font> She flashed a polite smile, subtly tossing a bit of shade his way.</font></font></font>

They were like him.
A Vituoso in the making within their respective Arts. 

Katora felt it too. The Energy crackling in the atmosphere. The kind only testing one's self against another's meticulously sharpened skill could generate. 

A scoff of a laugh left him, enjoying these little trades. Who would cave first? The concrete crack of their strikes upon his bones, or the tangle of close quarters he sought to unravel to grant himself the advantage anew? 

A kick axed in. He's forced to push off the toe of his sandal, and pitch his torso tilted, having that kick merely graze his ear. A lungful of air hissed in through his teeth. Another step. And in passing? He tried to snatch the Kid's foundation leg by the ankle and lift, before they restabalized from the committal kick.  Potentially forcing them to topple, granting himself an opening to create distance!

Little did he know how some of them truly felt about these gifts of his... Would he ever learn?

He&#39;s in shock when he learns the meaning of her name is, and it&#39;s something he ponders on a little bit. How intriguing it was to him to have a short name that meant so much...

<font color = white>&#34;Wooow... that&#39;s actually really pretty. Stars are like twinkling rocks, so maybe that pebble compliments it!&#34;</font>
He gives an affirming nod. The soft meaning behind her wording seems to have flown right over his head. Bringing his eyes back over toward the fight, he brings his knuckles up against his hips, rather proud.

  He hadn&#39;t thrown his all into that last attack, and his body was lightweight so with a shifting of weight Yurei fell to the ground.

  <font color = white>&#34;Look at you move.&#34;</font> He smiled.

There&#39;s a twinkle in his eye as he speaks on it. Truly, a passionate individual for anything that has to do with the ground.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: With all of this rock around, you'd be really strong! What about you, Shuye?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Mhm, mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Metal works well for defending too.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Yeaaah... but for flowers? It's not gonna look good... Not... 'natural'.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: You can actually shape metal and paint it to look realistic and natural.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Metal could be beautiful if used in an artistic way.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: See?  Kohana knows.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Huh? What about me?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: And if it was just for a flower garden, ceramics work well too.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: What element do you like?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Hmm. With this talk of garden...Is the soil here good for something like that?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Oh... I... uhh--
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I don't think I have the talent for elemental ninjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Where does your talents lay?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Really? I think you got the talent for anything you want to have talent in. Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Can always bring soil in from other areas.

They soon found themselves jumping!...and landing next to the pink haired composed girl. She later sat down and began to draft something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) shifted her kimono sash about a little to reveal a small pouch with a red cross on it. The meaning was simple enough.

<font color = white>&#34;Everything has a cost. I don&#39;t have the time to learn elemental jutsu.&#34;</font> Maybe it had nothing to do with talent; just desire.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Erm...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (but makes sense)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Intense. He started in a kneel. He bolted like the very first few steps of a Hundred Meter Dashing Olympian, ducked low to the ground, while his hand went for that tripping tactic. Needless to say. He was off-balance. His center of gravity? In shambles. 

It&#39;s what made Yurei&#39;s counter so genius. Allowing themselves to fall, only to use their remaining unrestrained leg to sweep their enemys from under them. This guy was too clever for his own good, says Katora&#39;s inner thoughts. 

The Fuuma just barely managed to spring off the very tips of his toes. It seems he tried to clear it like a miniature vault, which proved difficult, considering how low to the ground he&#39;s already positioned himself. Which is why that sweep clipped him. He felt it right in the ankle tendons too. The way they bruised and frayed ever so slightly from a mere taste of Yurei&#39;s counterattack. 

He powered through getting clipped, rolling off his shoulder again to recover from falling. During which, he scoops a handful of gravel and debris, accumulated on the arena from the winds. By the time he rights himself and turns to Yurei?

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry &#39;bout this.&#34;</font>
He tossed it. <b>The Dreaded Pocket Sand Maneuver.</b>
All that sediment was launched right for their eyes.

All to create an opening for himself to make distance. And he did. Skipping in reverse until he found himself all alone by the edge of the moat, almost. Why? To prove he could. And there? He slouched, catching his breath. His chest visibly heaving after all that intricate hard work. 

He reached into his holster--
No. Wait. He picked up the holster itself, unfastening its button snap from his belt, and turned it over. Nothing fell out. 

<font color = white>&#34;You win. You caught me massively unarmed... so even with the distance I&#39;ve made? You would defeat me in close quarters. Either that or I&#39;d run, but there&#39;s no fun in that. You&#39;re something else, Yurei. Good fight.&#34;</font> 

The Fuuma gave a slight, yet respectful bow of head, following the surrender.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Isn't fuuinjutsu pretty hard and time consuming to learn?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I am not sure I could invest in that. More respect to you.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It's just formula, mostly.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: A different kind of learning.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Does it include throwing more rocks?

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: -Maybe.- ... But, if it can be something even cooler than just throwing 'em... heh.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Pocket Sand.  Pocket Salt.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: Ack! Why would you wanna throw salt!?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Have you never got salt in your eye before?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Hard to fight in that condition.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Just throw it in your enemy's eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: No... but that sounds crazier than sand.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: That sounds effective. AND you have six hands!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Six hands to throw six hands full of it!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: o-oh?..i dont mind at all...mhm...i just want you to come back to us safely Shuye....a-and..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: doton..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) stamped his feet on the ground and surfaced to full stature as Katora did his speedy getaway. A sore sternum was a low cost for the glory of a confidence boost from the analytical combatant before him.

  A beige-colored haze is tossed into his face with guile, too much sand for lashes to stop. A dirty trick prime for use by academy students with nothing else to improvise with.

  <font color = white>&#34;Ah. .!&#34;</font> It catches him off guard, but his eyes were already somewhat small and inset, so the skill had an awkward outcome. Yurei would shake his head in a blurry way to clear his vision, spitting.
 He had respect for the tactic, afterall, no rules for fairplay set in the beginning.

  <font color = white>&#34;That was pretty good, throwin&#39; weapons move faster than any person can. That was fun, we should do it again sometime.&#34;</font> The youngster laughed out as both hands were placed behind his neck.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Yea you.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mhm, i definately do!..or well i have no reason to not like her...

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: and define rock..like doton..

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Oh wow.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: Also! You said you could do something that's like Doton?

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Until then? I'll be refining my tactics. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned toward Venturo with a quirked brow, then turned back toward Kohana with a scowl.

He understood <i>everything</i> going on. Absolutely.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;Well, this has been... interesting,&#34;</font> she said, glancing between Venturo and Shuye. <font color = white>&#34;So, uh, Venturo, what&#39;s the story behind this pebble?&#34;</font> She held it up with a curious look, hoping to steer the conversation into safer waters. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s more to it than just being pretty, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I think he gives all the girls pebbles.
<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) says: Pebble...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) knows that Kohana has no idea what she just signed herself on to. Story time? About rocks?
He inhales deeply.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I was out on one of my usual walks, thinking about what it was I was going to do today. Then, about ten minutes away from my house, I accidentally tripped over an ant hill that was the size of my pinkie toe... but in my stumbling...&#34;</font>
Again, there is this shining glint in his eye as he goes on. His body seems to almost be buzzing with excitement.

<font color = white>&#34;I saw something move underneath a nearby rock pile! So I got to digging and shuffling around... and there it was..&#34;</font>
As if he had the rock given in his hands, he brings the two of his hands infront of him, reliving the moment from this morning again. 

<font color = white>&#34;Blue and shiny! Just like your eyes. Mhm. It was destiny that you got that rock as a gift!&#34;</font>

Perking his head back up to what the kimono wearing individual had been saying about judo chops, he waves a hand over her way.
<font color = white>&#34;You gotta show me how you can do that sometime! That sounds so cool!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Wao, pebbles.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: I gotta find one for you, Tsu.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Heh.  Thanks.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Wow, what a stroy.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Every day is an adventure, Shuye... Every one.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Never forget it!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) was tempted to boop the nose.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana couldn&#39;t quite make sense of Venturo&#39;s story. To her, it was just a rock. However, her curiosity got the better of her, and she couldn&#39;t help but ask one thing.

<font color = white>&#34;Venturo, do you -only- give these rocks to girls?&#34;</font> she asked, a mischievous tone in her voice. <font color = white>&#34;Are you, perhaps, what they call a serial... romance seeker? If so, I believe we have therapists for that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Though he&#39;s far too stupid and oblivious otherwise to understand the hidden contexts of what she&#39;s asking, he responds almost <i>too</i> quickly.

<font color = white>&#34;Nope. I&#39;d give rocks to the guys too, but besides Hideo I haven&#39;t really gotten to talk to many, and sometimes I.. don&#39;t have the rocks on me for everybody.&#34;</font> Then, he does a little bit of pondering on it some as well; curious himself about one thing in particular.

<font color = white>&#34;... Do you not like yours?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Not really. No.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: Why not?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I was going to skip it over the water actually.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Huuuuh?!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Why would you do that, that's a treasure from our meeting!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Is it not my property now?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: It iiiiis.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Umm...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Yurei(The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) OOCs: (maybe that fixed the profile)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) begins to juggle her rock. <font color = white>&#34;I am sure she wouldn&#39;t.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
