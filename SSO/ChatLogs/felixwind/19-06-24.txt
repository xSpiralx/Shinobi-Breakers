She even counted on her fingers some. <font color = white>&#34;Heeeeeyy....&#34;</font> she came to her conclusion.

<font color = white>&#34;She&#39;s right! If I got 50... And give -you- 50 then I&#39;m at zero.. An&#39; you give it -back- I&#39;m just right back where I started!&#34;</font> she pointed toward Fubiki and Hideo in a accusory manner. <font color = white>&#34;You two are -bad- at math!&#34;</font> she did not think they were pulling one over her, but merely that their math was off.</font></font></font>
