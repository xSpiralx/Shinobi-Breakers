<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s relentless stride towards Higane slows as her words cut through the air, piercing his focus like a well-aimed blade. Her snicker and taunt reach him clearly, igniting a flicker of irritation in his eyes that he struggles to conceal behind a mask of stoicism.

He hears her accusations about his demeanor, about not understanding what it means to be revered, to carry the weight of expectations. For a moment, Sogeki&#39;s gaze intensifies with a silent challenge, his jaw tensing imperceptibly.

<font color = white>&#34;You think I don&#39;t know pressure?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice is low, carrying a hint of raw intensity. <font color = white>&#34;Being at the top means everyone&#39;s watching, waiting for you to slip. It&#39;s a different kind of pressure, one that fuels me.&#34;</font>

His demeanor shifts subtly, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. <font color = white>&#34;But that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, isn&#39;t it? To show them all who stands at the pinnacle.&#34;</font> His tone is nonchalant yet laced with confidence, his eyes locking onto Higane&#39;s with a calculated glare.

Despite her faltering stance, Sogeki remains cautious, sensing an opportunity amidst her wavering resolve. His own pride and determination drive him forward, pushing him to capitalize on the moment and assert his dominance once more.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: What...even is this about I wonder?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Whats with everyone trying to sound so...tough
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Main character syndrome.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s had said too much. To think that none of this would have happened if she didnt hear fellow nearby colleague speak of how mighty the Hyuuga believe themselves to be.

Like a fortress crumbling under the weight of a dragons paw, Higane drops her stance and backs off, raising a heavy hand high above her head. <font color = white>&#34;I surrender.&#34;</font> She laments.

The spiral of ying and yang emotions bubbling inside her could not be quelled, at least not now and not here. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;l change the stigma. Mark my words.&#34;</font>

These are the last things the young girl says as she backs off taking a seat on a nearby colum.. She flips her pouch around..

Now fully visible was the Cadeuces Staff and the Red Cross, labeled across her pouch. She remained there idle and fumbling through her supplies ignoring any attempts at discussion.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s intense gaze follows every movement of Higane&#39;s retreat, his expression a mix of frustration and disappointment. He had been ready for a clash of wills, eager to prove his dominance in combat, but now that opportunity slipped away with her surrender.

<font color = white>&#34;What? You&#39;re giving up just like that?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice carries a hint of irritation, his brow furrowing deeply. His hands clench into fists at his sides as he steps closer, his posture tense with pent-up energy.

<font color = white>&#34;You had me on the ropes, and now you&#39;re backing down?&#34;</font> His words are sharp, laced with a mixture of scolding and begrudging respect. <font color = white>&#34;You talk a big game, but you fold when things get tough. How do you expect to change any stigma like that?&#34;</font>

Despite his frustration, Sogeki&#39;s features contort into a slightly exaggerated scowl, emphasizing his displeasure at the anticlimactic end to their confrontation. His pride demanded a real challenge, not a forfeit, and he couldn&#39;t hide his disappointment at the missed opportunity for a true test of his abilities.

<font color = white>&#34;Next time, don&#39;t surrender so easily,&#34;</font> he mutters under his breath, turning away with a dismissive wave of his hand. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</font> With that, he stalks off, his demeanor a mix of simmering anger and determination to find a more satisfying challenge elsewhere.</font></font></font>

No word, no matter how sharp seemed to reach her. Yet the various comments did not fall on deaf ears.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I could use some ryo for weapons.

<font color = white>&#34;Yo, good see family on the rise, your Jyuuken is heat no lie.&#34;</font> he horribly rapped to his fellow clansmen.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hmph!How dare you disrespect me!&#34;</font>she said as she opened up her purse to only see her beauty products and a single ryo.A single sweat droplet would flow down her face as she remembered she gambled and spent all of her money on her new heels.

<font color = white>&#34;It was worth it too.&#34;</font>she thought to herself as she admired her shoes.


<font color = white>&#34;Psh!I&#39;ll just have to ask my old man when I see him again.&#34;</font>she would tuck her hair behind her ear as she knew the kage stopped funding her due to the over spending hence why she decided to become a shinobi.

If anyone was listening they would be able to hear her purse gasping for air due to the lack of money she has.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey now..its alright to not be rich.Im not from noble clan,so my survival consists on what i do.Whoever...&#34;</font>His face will go serious,like he was dead serious on what was about to say next

<font color = white>&#34;Try to make money by yourself,your father won&#39;t support you forever,remember that.So you might have alot of ryo now...but if just spend and spend without thinking of how to invest and increase it...sooner or later you might become a regular person just like all of us miss.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You never struggled...thats our difference.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: You're right hence why I said we're not the same.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You need to struggle...otherwise you would never learn.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: I am.
<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: Struggling isn't needed, you know.. She should feel lucky.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: You kind of struggled in our spar Najiro..maybe you can show her how to properly struggle.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would tightly grasp the boy&#39;s shirt

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve been cut off!The old man cut me off!Now who&#39;s going to buy me my stuff!I have to work!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Heh....and thats bad?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirks. <font color = white>&#34;You going to give up again Najiro?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look her directly at their eyes

<font color = white>&#34;You think thats bad? Having no monetary support by your father so you can get anything and everything? Tsk,tsk..Perhaps for you is bad,afterall you are spoiled since birth.

But let me say it again,what you experience at this moment...is what everyone NORMAL experience.You want your stuff? earn it.Do you think your old man got the money out of nowhere? That they didn&#39;t struggled? Or your ancestor didn&#39;t struggle? Cause let me tell you something..Without your father,and your ancestors trying their best...you would had been just like us,another small family member of a family which isn&#39;t noble,Neither anyone cares to know their name all around their town.&#34;</font>They will pause afterwhich will continue

<font color = white>&#34;So prove yourself as senju and earn what you belive is your right to have.The other option it to beg your old man untill he dies.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (call me victor blame cause im spitting the truth)

<font color = white>&#34;Okay for one you need to like swallow your spit when you&#39;re up close like this.First of all I do work hard to get what I want,I have to put semi effort when buying my clothes and getting my deals.Second you people are my people hence why I care about how you people smell and look or even eat&#34;</font>

The senju would take a step back before dusting herself off with her lint brush.It appeared her silk dress had caught some lint from being to close to the black haired boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: -sigh- we will see.

She closed her eyes abruptly and lowered her head a bit, she brought her right hand up to her head, it&#39;s like she&#39;s had a small headache- For some reason, though it doesn&#39;t seem to affect them as much...
