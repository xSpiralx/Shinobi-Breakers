<font color = white>&#34;So like, what do you like to do for fun? I&#39;ll go first. I like to go swimming in the lake and try to catch fish with my bare-hands. I&#39;m almost able to catch them too. They slip away for only a few inches. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) had never thought of what she did for fun. She found lots of things fun, too many things to count. Too many things to say in a single sentence. How could Laro easily decipher the few things he did for fun? Did he not enjoy life? Did he not enjoy everything?

<font color = white>&#34;I just do whatever is fun at the time!&#34;</font> She exclaims loudly, deciding that the most simple way to answer the question.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would nod a few times before shifting his gaze to Towa.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks over towards Shishorama, before shifting his gaze to the kid who just arrived. He&#39;d wave his hand at him.

Snail's pace indeed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With a wide grin on her face, Shishorama observes Lero as he approaches her at speeds unattainable to herself, moving like lightning!

About time their tiny little arms could see some action. She cocked her fist, launching it straight for his jaw.

Fortunately, the boy would lift his hands up infront of his face, letting his forearms take the brunt of the attack. His technique was rather lousy, to say th least.

As her attack ended it was time for his own, launching a counter-attack of his own, cocking his hand and sending it towards her gut.

As hardy and braggadocious as she was, she had little practice in the real art of battle, and lacked the capability to back up her talk with skill alone. Indeed, she was outclassed in every regard!

Still, she just barely manages a block and swings at Laro&#39;s chin!

The girl&#39;s eyes bug out as the pain spreads through her abdomen. Strangely enough, her smile only grows. As his fist smashes into her body, could feel her sturdy frame harden as if preparing for the blow. She was well on her way to developing a tough physique, unfortunately she just wasn&#39;t there yet.

<font color = white>&#34;That was a good one!&#34;</font> She exclaims wildly as she throws yet another sloppy punch to the other&#39;s face!</font></font></font>

Yet he landed a hit, none-the-less. But it didn't seem like it slower her down much as she launched another attack right back at him.

Once again he managed to block it, but surely his ability to block shots was running out.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, t-that sounds good.&#34;</font> he said, hoping to see what he might pick up from their match.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With a swift movement, Shishorama brings her forearm up to deflect Laro's incoming strike. In a split second, she turns the tables and attempts to deliver a powerful blow to his sternum, showcasing her tenacity and grit despite her lack of refined martial prowess. Her unyielding spirit and unwavering determination serve as her greatest weapon, allowing her to hold her own against even the most skilled opponents.

And it was quite a strong one, as she managed to hit him right into his sternum with a rather powerful punch. It knocked the air out of him, causing him to hunch over a bit, sustaining rather heavy injury.

As he held his stomach, it was quite evident, one of those would probably put him out of the commission.

He could probably land a few more hits on her but would it be enough? Probably not.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) instictively rushed to Sakuya's defense and took the brunt of the blow!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hey!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Damage?)
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) just reduced their health by a cost of Light Damage - 4 / 6

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) As the white-haired dancer swings at her, Sakuya quickly parries the punch with her arm. Seizing the moment, she throws a punch right back, aiming for the dancer&#39;s midsection...Is what she would have done but her cousin saved her oddly.

<font color = white>&#34;Rather rude of you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between the two Senjus and white haired dancer. Was this an altercation brewing in real time. Perhaps something needed to be done to calm the tensions.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys, umm, how about we all just take a moment to cool off? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) crushed through the youngster&#39;s defenses, but found herself parried off-- Or something.

Someone got hit for the shit talking, so she let it be for now with scowling, red eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one calling people names.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighed and shook her head, <font color = white>&#34;I thought you guys were just being friendly. What do we actually call you then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: Is this not for the enrollments?
<br><font color=red>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) increases their health by Heavy Damage - 5.96 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Kamiya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) nervously watched the few bicker amongst themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...&#34;</font> is all he could manage to get out, deciding to not get in the middle of things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A pleasure to meet you Kamiya!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Swallowing her pride, she steps forward with her hand extended in a gesture of apology.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</font> she says sincerely, looking into the dancer&#39;s eyes. <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to offend you. If I&#39;ve said or done something to upset you, I apologize.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am not sure what I said as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gsaze as he never exactly got his question answered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Pfew. Glad that&#39;s sorted out. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) yawned, what a morning it had been already, just idly passing the time. She would just glance over to the girl next to her briefly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. We haven&#39;t spoken before but since we&#39;re standing here. I&#39;m Okiku.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) glad the fighting stopped. She would've just kept taking punches for either student until she passed out. Crisis averted.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sorry my cousin is aloof as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) squinted between them, obviously suspicious of the apology and pleasant greetings. Darting eyes warily regarded the hand gesture. This was the second weirdo to say something and then pretend they didn&#39;t know it&#39;d be a problem. Shoulders roll, dislocating and then -popping- back into place as she maintained her expression, despite the pain that should have caused.

<font color = white>&#34;... fine.&#34;</font> She mumbled, carefully taking her hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (was glad*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;That was rather... Keep doing that and you&#39;re going to have arthritis soon,&#34;</font> she says, pointing meaningfully at the girl&#39;s shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Teach me how to roll my shoulder like that!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks over at the shoulder dislocating like that.

<font color = white>&#34;That looked painful. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: You should get that checked out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) released the other girl&#39;s hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to teach. Just do it.&#34;</font> She replied, ignoring the cautions against arthritis. <font color = white>&#34;Of course it was painful.&#34;</font> She replied, wondering how it could not be-- or why anyone would do it if it wasn&#39;t. Dislocation could be useful for escaping binds, though...

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can ger arthiritis.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: get*
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Can you dislocate anything else?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I see this is today's new hangout.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: This will be my everyday hang out!
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) increases their health by Full - 6 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) yells: Mind if I see!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: At least you'll be easy to find, Shishorama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) held a hand out and bent her index finger nearly all the way back, until it was curling backwards. This was less of a dislocation and more of a hypermobility, though-- but which kid would even care? There's a slight shift in expression, suggesting this was somehow more painful than the shoulder roll.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) widened her eyes at Kamiya&#39;s finger. What the heck is even that?! <font color = white>&#34;Oh my goodness! Your finger is <b>BROKEN</b>!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Nope, the bones are just fine.
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: ...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya watches with a mixture of fascination and curiosity as the white-haired dancer flexes her index finger backward in an extreme display of hypermobility. For a moment, Sakuya thinks she can detect a wince in the dancer&#39;s eyes, a subtle hint that this unusual flexibility comes at a cost.

Intrigued, a thought crosses Sakuya&#39;s mind: this girl might be just as eccentric as she is. Feeling a newfound sense of kinship, she can&#39;t help but feel that a friendship between them could be equally intriguing and enriching.

Taking a step closer, Sakuya smiles and extends her hand in a friendly gesture. <font color = white>&#34;You know, we might have more in common than we thought. Would you like to be friends? I&#39;m Sakuya, by the way. Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would dead pan and turn towards Shishorama.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s a Kaguya- Like the Hokage.&#34;</font> Hoping this would shed some light on their abilities in some compacity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s jaw dropped as he saw Kamiya&#39;s finger.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s...scary to see. Also anyone else started to feel pain in their fingers after seeing that? No, just me? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*she's)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I think he is a she.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [oh man ur lucky u fixed that]
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: So it was an over reaction?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Who cares that she's a Kaguya?! She just broke- twisted her finger!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Do we have a medic-nin nearby?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) let her finger snap back. <font color = white>&#34;Sure, Sakuy--&#34;</font> Kamiya stopped mid sentence, certain she had heard another unlucky soul who wanted to receive a punch. The feeling vanished after a moment. Her finger is held with her other hand, and its discolored, now-- significantly redder than the others, a little swollen. It was hardly a free action as evidenced by this cost.

<font color = white>&#34;It hurts, but it isn&#39;t broken.&#34;</font> She said, to the intense youngster. <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t break my bones.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) gave a long stare- A long confused, judgemental stare before mentally facepalming.

<font color = white>&#34;Her abilities are probably like Lord Hokage, a Kaguya... They manipulate bone.&#34;</font> A smirk came to his face, he found it funny people hadn&#39;t heard stories of the Leader of the Village. Though on a second glance... They could manipulate Bones... but the fleshy parts were still damaged.

<font color = white>&#34;Though, youf pain tolerance must be insane since you damage the flashy bits...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*your Typo 2/2 may as well aim for the moon in typos.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Can Kamiya manipulate my bones too?
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks:  You realized if they're okay then you shouldn't over react, right?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I would assume so.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (question, Kamiya
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (does Kamiya resemble a male?)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) grinned at the Uchiha on the end of the line. She approached the boy, and held  her swollen index finger out. There&#39;s a look of incredible focus. She grunted, and huffed, and puffed, the obvious spice of pain in her inflection as a -hole- began to open at the end of her finger, and a pure, white finger bone began to poke out. It&#39;s clear this is taking an exhaustive amount of effort as her entire body is shaking.

It was revolting; unsettling.

<font color = white>&#34;Pull my finger.&#34;</font> Urged a strained voice.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [yes]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [the other 11 year old kaguya]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (Kami M and Kami F.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I have a question before I pull your finger!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Are you a male or female? I'm not sure what to call you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) couldn&#39;t tell if she was talking to him or to the sable-haired youth next to him. Either way the request was rather weird. Kamiya wanted her finger to be pulled, while it seemed the bone was starting to protrude through the actual finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would blink for a moment, though in his morbid curiousity he&#39;d absolutely do so. He wondered if that bone was in-fact coming out of that gory hole Kamiya&#39;s body seem to make. The Uchiha heard stories of the bones tearing through skin of both user and foe, this was far more clean than anticipated. However there was a strangeness to it when seeing something like this first hand.

The weird part was seeing how white the bone was despite it travelling through fleshm he expected them stained red, really.

<font color = white>&#34;Gnarly.&#34;</font> It was the only wword he could think of while doing this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clenched her jaw as he pulled an entire digit out. The hole closed, and rather than some gelatenous, boneless finger like one woudl expect, Kamiya seemed no worse for wear than before. There wasn&#39;t even a sign that she&#39;d just opened and inch wide hole in her flesh. The pain was real, but there were not lasting effects. 

She took the finger from him and wagged it in his face, the digit bouncing and bending at each knuckle. 

<font color = white>&#34;And now I can use this like a dagger!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) carefully observed the whole thing. The word &#39;gnarly&#39; described it well. But the boy got so invested into the process that he could see every little detail. And this, well, this had undesired results.

Dark haired boy immediately covered his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh I think I&#39;m gonna be sick. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: ---
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: She just -- pulled the -- bone out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the finger, dumbfounded. She thought she&#39;d seen a lot in her twelve years of life, but that was absolutely <i>disgusting</i>. Never wanting to witness that again, she persists in asking Kamiya the question that bothered her so greatly.

<font color = white>&#34;So....are you a male or female...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly wheeled around, slashing the intense youngster with her abnormally sharp finger bone.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you stupid?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Well, no...maybe..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wasn&#39;t sure if he should find this cool, scary, concerning, or morbid. He proceeded to mentally choose all of the above.

<font color = white>&#34;Eeeehww, but awesome. That&#39;s taking &#39;pointer finger&#39; very literally.&#34;</font> Making fun of the situation rather than keeling over sick, though he really had no idea how to react and fell back on humour as a coping mechanism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the they/them, unphased. <font color = white>&#34;I just can&#39;t tell, okay?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: It's really obvious I'm a girl, you weirdo.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: O-Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Right!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Because the voice!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...And the hair...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: R-Right!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: And the pretty face? 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The other Kami is a guy.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: And the unearthjly grace?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Well, you certainly have unearthly grace!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Yeah that last one...oh never mind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) loomed.

<font color = white>&#34;Right?&#34;</font> She whispered, dangerously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Don't all Kaguya have the poise?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) leaned closer to Kamiya with a quirked eyebrow, <font color = white>&#34;Why are we whispering?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Ei!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) makes a small yelp in surprise. She wasn&#39;t easily intimidated, but Kamiya was getting there. <font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you poking me with that!? It came from inside you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) covers his mouth again as she poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Pointer Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sticky Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: It's not my fault that I couldn't tell what you were! You didn't ask to be born like that!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I feel a punch coming.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I have a feeling it'd be more like a puncture wound.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly whipped the finger toward the wall, letting it smash against it into bits and pieces.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re pretty stupid. You&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t beat up special needs children.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: So the bones can break...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: That is a good one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) frowned a bit at the Kaguya&#39;s remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey hey, no need to call names. We&#39;re all friends here. Right? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighs and relaxes as the tension in her body dies down. She was expecting a punch or stab, but it never came. <font color = white>&#34;Phew...that was close. - I wonder when the classes are going to start.&#34;</font> She says, looking off into the distance. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Laro(The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) OOCs: ( hmm so are apps closed? )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Anri(The dead eyed teen-Airide) OOCs: (For?)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) shrugged, <font color = white>&#34;No idea when, but I want to start as soon as possible. If it&#39;s going to use any sort of Chakra I&#39;ll be more than prepared.

I&#39;m just hoping it&#39;ll be very soon, I actually want to do something more than a team work and trust exercise today.&#34;</font> The Traditional Uchiha admitted, pulling out a fan to cool himself once more. He wondered if they would learn anything, or would it be a second exercise? For now it was hard to tell.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I think Anti Heros are better.

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I said yes before, so I don't mind saying yes again.

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: You're joking right?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Kaguya clan holds the office of Hokage...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: He is joking. Obviously.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kyouhei (The intense white-haired child-Soft boi 666) yells: Obviously!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gaze a bit before he shook his head.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: What's your name, dumby?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) slowly picked himslef up as he turned his baggy, lifeless gaze on the Kaguya as he straightened himself up, at least to the best of his abilities as all he ahd to his name were baggy clothing and a worn backpouch.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) stared at the boy.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gaze away from the Kaguya after their comment. Honestly they were unsure if it was a compliment or an insult at this point.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Join!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) stares blankly, processing this information for a good amount of time.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (I hunger irl)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) walks by the village with his hands tucked in his pockets, noticing a familiar voice calling out to him. Turning around, he&#39;d notice Shishorama at the ramen shop along with a few other students. Slowly, he&#39;d join up with them.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys. What are you eating? It sure smells nice. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) would place some change on the table, ordering their fill.

<font color = white>&#34;Pork b-buns please.&#34;</font> he said with a nod, they&#39;d then look over his shoulder, smiling to the one who introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nice to meet you, I&#39;m Sarutobi, Yakeru.&#34;</font> he&#39;d introduce himself with a weak smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Nice to meet you Yakeru.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) wets his lips as he sees Yakeru&#39;s food arrive. It sure got him hungry in an instant. Placing his hand in his pocket, he&#39;d get his money pouch, only to open it and see -- there was nothing inside, or rather not enough Ryo to get a proper meal.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh. &#34;</font> he mumbled to himself dissapointed, before returning the pouch back into his pocket.

<font color = white>&#34;You know what, nothing for me please, I&#39;ll just hang out. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d say to the shopkeepers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Have you guys already figured out what path you'll take on your journey?
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) asks: It's nice to meet you too... Uh.. What's your name?
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: My name is Laro.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Heya Yuuto.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) yells: Well, Laro. It's n-nice to meet you pal!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Can we get something else?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was just enjoying the pork buns through their time here. He had barely noticed the moment Laro arrived, another person to introduce himself. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, nice to meet you, Laro. I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;You sure you don&#39;t want anything? It&#39;s my treat.&#34;</font> He said that without really waiting for an answer. <font color = white>&#34;Hey chef, another serving for our buddy Laro there.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Sure, I still got some more money from the bounty. What should we get this time Kumirama?&#34;</font> Thankfully, as a street stall of sorts, this place&#39;s prices were rather cheap, and the food quality was still great.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would clear their throat as she slips the uchiha a list of food she wanted.The list contained three order of seaweed salad,ten chicken wings and some green tea ice cream.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) had to hold back a laughter. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you&#39;re quite the glutton, arin&#39;t you?&#34;</font> That would really burn a hole through his pockets. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, but next time we&#39;re out eating, it&#39;s your treat, sounds fair?&#34;</font> And he wouildn&#39;t have mercy on her.

The list of food was quite appealing, and he decided to order it just to try some of those things as well. Thankfully, even if he ran out of the bounty money, he still had some pocket money as well since despite his relationship with his family, he&#39;s still an Uchiha.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Chef, serve these over here, please!&#34;</font> Sliding the paper to the cook, he just waited a little bit before food started being served, each one with a smell more appetizing than the one before it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s eyes lit up as Yuuto ordered food for him. A small gesture, but had a great effect. Forming a smile on his face, his eyes slightly getting teary, he&#39;d down a nod to the Uchiha boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you Yuuto, I owe you one. &#34;</font>

After a while another ration of pork buns would arrive, letting the smell fill out the area. He&#39;d quickly dig into his food.

<font color = white>&#34;Mhmm this is woo gwood. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d talk with his mouth full.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Back!)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hey! Laro!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Hey Shisho.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Eating well?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You should spar with Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Oh no, not again.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You two are more each others speed!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) would walk up to where a lot of people were..

<font color = white>&#34;So this is where everyone went!&#34;</font> She would say as she munched on a strawberry mochi!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would munch on his food, now properly swallowing it before he talked. He&#39;d also look down the table at everyone who sat around.

<font color = white>&#34;Did you guys figure out what you want to do as shinobi? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Taijutsu!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would sway side to side as she watched her food be made.This caused the girl to begin to blush as sweat can also be seen dripping from her face<font color = white>&#34;Looks....looks soooo good.&#34;</font>The first thing Kumi would dive into would be the wings.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...it&#39;s soooo crispy too!I can kiss this cook!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) shook his head,

<font color = white>&#34;Not really, I kind of want to do it all....&#34;</font> he said nervously looking around, he knew how foolish it might sound aloud.

<font color = white>&#34;A generalist...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Kumirama.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Howdy?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Ku-
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: She didn't do it, I swear!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I've been with her the entire time!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks:  Ooo~ Someone's in trouble?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: If anyone say I stole their money they're lying!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: I won it!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yeah, she has an addiction!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked at the crowd. Ignoring all the other statements being said.

<font color = white>&#34;Kumirama, I need you to come with me.&#34;</font> She eerily smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Can I go? She's my sister!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) puts down the food as he slowly turns around.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh, busted big time. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d mumble under his breath. But then it hit him. They were all noble clans so it would probably look quite bad on them, whatever it was. Him? He was nothing special. 

So he decided to step forward.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Chuunin, it was me. It wasn&#39;t Kumirama. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: I'm equally responsible for her actions..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Well... I'll save some food for you Kumirama. Good luck. We'll be waiting here.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Oh? I wasn't told about anything, I just wanted to reward Kumirama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) gulped.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh boy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) was about to run away,but an invisible force would cause her to trip.

<font color = white>&#34;Ugh....I guess it&#39;s a sign for me to come....Can I take my food with me?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn't think he could argue against a Chuunin when he didn't even know what this was about-And hey! It was about a reward!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Oh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh of relief.

<font color = white>&#34;Back to my food it is then. &#34;</font>

He&#39;d instantly dart towards the pork buns. not letting them get cold. Almost as if he had the Flying Raijin. &#34;</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Go ahead, take your food.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Bye, Kumi!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would take wings,but would leave the rest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) had a scared expression on her face as she turned to her sister.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Are you all set to recieve your reward?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Lead the way my good sir.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: I hope she'll be okay...
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: That was your sister?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hey, it's that one dark-haired boy!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Yuuto, I have been told terrible news.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: For a minute I thought she was an Uchiha, the way she has redish eyes. I heard Uchihas can have cool glowy eyes.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) thinks that it wouldn't be the same thing to eat all this food without Kumirama. It's not like he could save the salad for later without it losing it's freshness, so the least he did was ask the Chef to use his freezer. Placing his green tea ice cream there to share it later with his friend.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: That's something that takes time to unlock Laro, and it's not something you can just keep up the entire time I believe.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: And hello Kumirama sister.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: And what terrible news?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) finishes his food just in time for the dark haired boy to come bearing bad news. He'd slowly turn around, wiping his mouth.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I have been told I can't fail out of the academy. I just got more work if I fail.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Who is Kumiramasister?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: It's horrible..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Well, better work hard then!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) yells: This is the worse possible outcome!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: HEY!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Anyone here want to make a bet?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: About.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Say yes or no!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: Depends. What kinda bet?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I bet I'm the only person here who can take a full-fledged punch from Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: That doesn't sound like a fair bet... or a good idea.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Uhhhhhhhh
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: HE SAID YES!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I mean.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I sure can't.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: I'm not that good at taking hits just yet either.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I win!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You owe me ten ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: This is fraud.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: That's why you must always ask for the contents of the bet.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: You could get caught on scams like that in the future.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) Much like this one.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'll collect my tax in the future!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) yells: You don't know my name!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: You shall never get your money...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: She's also going to the academy. Good luck trying to avoid her.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stares at the dark-haired boy intently, silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Oh no.
