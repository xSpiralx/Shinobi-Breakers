<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) retracts his fist upon receiving no fist bump. Was she the more formal kind?

Resisting the urge to say that much was obvious to her first sentence, he simply crossed his arms as she suggested a game for them to play. <font color = white>&#34;Hmmm... so your name is that valuable huh?&#34;</font>

With a smile on his face he agreed. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, that sounds good, rock paper scissors. I like those odds.&#34;</font> He was confident when it came to his luck, although he shouldn&#39;t, it was terrible. He didn&#39;t want to lose his shades but this sounded too fun to pass up on.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) begins to laugh at her brother&#39;s underling as she would prepare her first battle of the art of rock papper scissors.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s duel!&#34;</font>she scream as she begin to shake her hand to confuse the Uchiha.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kumirama(The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) OOCs: (1 beats 2,2 beats 3, 3 beats 1
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (got it
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (as expected
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was still smiling in confidence even as the girl began to shake her hand. He instantly began to imitate her, and to be honest, there was no process to his thoughts, this was simply about luck.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;</font> Throwing his hand out at the same time as her, he had chosen to paper! His confidence, however, was instantly shattered when he saw she had chosen scissors.

And he theatrically fell to his knees, defeated! <font color = white>&#34;Noooo.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) 
A dark cloud would appear behind the gambler as she begin to laugh maliciously

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s mine!IT&#39;S ALL MINE!&#34;</font>she said as she reach towards the boy&#39;s shades.The clouds would now turn to thunder clouds once putting the glasses on.

<font color = white>&#34;So tell me do I look cool?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) looked up at the girl as his shades were snatched. As dark clouds gathered behind her and thunder struck in the distance, she looked truly evil! Still, he couldn&#39;t lose hope!

The Uchiha jumped to his feet. <font color = white>&#34;I admit it, you look amazing with those.&#34;</font> She really did, stylish, nice. <font color = white>&#34;But I can&#39;t simply let you walk away with those shades! I challenge for a rematch.&#34;</font>

After declaring his intent, he revealed what he would bet this turn. <font color = white>&#34;If you win, I will give you my Clan Jacket.&#34;</font> It had the symbol of the Uchiha on it, and it was pretty valuable, at least in his eyes. <font color = white>&#34;If I win, you give me back my shades AND tell me your name.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;What say you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (btw, i noticed you called Shishorama 'brother', pretty sure he's a girl actually
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kumirama(The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) OOCs: (Ik XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (xD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would pat the Uchiha&#39;s head while laughing which caused her boobs to shake bit.

<font color = white>&#34;There There!I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t know my name after being my brother&#39;s underling.&#34;</font>its clear that the girl wasn&#39;t trying to return the shades she won<font color = white>&#34;Deal but i&#39;ll need something in return.If I win you have to walk around in a dress.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: I mean sister.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Sometimes they can be super strong and I forget they/'re a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: But you didn't hear that from me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) turned red when he received that pat to the head, he didn&#39;t even notice her boobs, it still made them embarassed and a bit ashamed though. <font color = white>&#34;First of all, I am no one&#39;s Underling! I could definitely beat your Brothe-I mean Sister, yeah.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And it seems my jacket is not enough for you and you want something more extreme. I&#39;m not gonna lie, this doesn&#39;t sound like a fair bet at all.&#34;</font> Would he take it though, well, if he&#39;s anything... it&#39;s overconfident. He had already lost once, it meant he had higher chances of winning this time.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, I accept, but why would you even want me to go around in a dress? Are you one of those who just likes humiliating others?&#34;</font> Scrunching up his nose, he began to nervously tap his foot on the ground, damn, he didn&#39;t wanna go around in a dress.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hmm....
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: You're right.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: I'll take your jacket then1
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kumirama(The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) OOCs: (!*
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Alright.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) is a bit relieved at that.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (same rolls from before
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: GAH!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) felt a wave of excitement rushing through his body, a small blush coming to his cheeks as he barely contained a bright smile. <font color = white>&#34;Hahahaha!&#34;</font> With a hearty laugh, the previous dark thuner cloud quickly drifted away from the sky as the sun began to shine behind him as if to say it had been watching that and it was proud of the boy.

With that done, he snatched his shades back. <font color = white>&#34;Back where they belong! Now then...&#34;</font> He waited for the girl to introduce herself.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would fall to her knees as the shades were snatched from her.

<font color = white>&#34;Nooo!I guess the gods blessed you this time.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Care to go again?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Samething.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: If I win I get the shades again and if you win you get my name.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Hm... seems like we'll keep going at this for a while, but it sounds good to me.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: GUUUUH!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) stood tall and proud. The girl had now learned, he only knew how to play paper.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would look gloomy as she was beaten by the Uchiha.

<font color = white>&#34;Fiiiine....my name is Senju Kumirama.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: A deal is a deal.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Well, it's nice to meet you Kumirama. You're definitely more fun than most of the other kids.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Kinda wonder what sort of bets you're gonna come up during our academy year. I'll be looking forward to it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) a single tear fell down their face as they lost their chance of getting cool shades.

<font color = white>&#34;You think so?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Yea!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: There's a guy there.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: He's been just looking off in the distance.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) felt no pity as she shed a tear. It was a shame, but these shades are his. <font color = white>&#34;Trust me, I never lie.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And yeah, there is a guy there.&#34;</font> He turns to face that masked boy.<font color = white>&#34; Raising a hand, he waved at them. &#34;</font>Hey! What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Hm... they must be daydreaming.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Ahhhh
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaito(The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) OOCs: (test
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) shook his head, breaking his long stare into nothingness and depression as he loked towards the two other kids,  giving them a wave back before rubbing the back of his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello.&#34;</font> He stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Pleasure to meet ya.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: You as well.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Nice to meet you! Everything okay? You just been standing there for a while.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: It seems I was lost, then I froze.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: It's a animal instict when you are scared.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Are you scared?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: MWAHAHAHA!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Terrified.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Did you need to cross the bridge?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) gave a glance toward the crimson eyed gambler, noticing them getting closer as he took a few steps back, Keeping his distance.


<font color = white>&#34;Bridge?&#34;</font> He questioned before looking in the distance, noticing it before shaking his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Nope.&#34;</font> He stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) throws a pokeball at the teen hoping that she'll capture her a rare one.In reality it was just a balled up paper which said freeze.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watched the interaction with curiosity, the girl sure was an eccentric one. <font color = white>&#34;Welll...&#34;</font> He watched the paper ball sail through the air towards the dark haired boy. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re still lost, need help getting somewhere? Are you going to take part in the academy as well?&#34;</font>

He aassumed that last part due to their attire, some people like to dress the part, and he found that to be pretty cool.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Yea we can help ya.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: You seem cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, noticing the paper ball coming towards him, wacking him in the side of his face with no reaction. He blinked once, reaching down for the paper ball before tossing it back towards the crimon eyed gambler.

<font color = white>&#34;I...I am a bit lost and my parents told me to go to the...&#34;</font> He mumbled off thinking about it. <font color = white>&#34;The academy...&#34;</font> He stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) tried to run away from the pokeball,but adly she was captured.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh?I&#39;m Kumirama,it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.Did your parents fill out the paper work for you to join?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) approached the boy rather than just standing to the side. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s always nice to meet a new classmate. I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> Then he offered the kid a fistbump.

<font color = white>&#34;We can take you to the academy, but yeah, you need the paperwork filledo ut. Should&#39;ve gotten to your household through mail.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: KURIRAMA IS DATING MY CHILDHOOD FRIEND!?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) glanced down at Yuuto&#39;s hand, raising his fist and connected the fist bump before rubbing the back of his head yawning.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you both, I&#39;m Kaito.&#34;</font> He stated before the looking at the sky. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah...sadly I am going to the academy.&#34;</font> He mumbled.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: What...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: They filled out all the forms.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Nice!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: So when class starts you should head there.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: It's okay I missed the first class too.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Maybe I'll miss it..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Heyyy.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Don't be negative.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Always think postive!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: That would be a good thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would give the child a thumbs up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Positive would be me sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: And not going to class.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Sleeping is fun too.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: See.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Is this your way of asking for a slumber party?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: We should all just sleep.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Kumirama*
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) asks: What is a slumber party?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) looked at the piece of paper that Kaito held but then his sights went towards small pebble on the ground. Okay, he could throw it pretty far... picking it up, he looked at the direction Shishorama was in and just tossed it while aiming at her. He was very likely to miss, but could at the very least make her realize he had seen her. <font color = white>&#34;She&#39;s so loud.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wait... you two missed the first day of class? I can fill you in on what happened if you&#39;re both curious. I took part in most of it. I got the gist of what it was about.&#34;</font> If they were willing to hear, he was up for a rather extensive explanation of what happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Oh?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hey, Kumirama!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: A slumber party is a sleep over.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Guess what!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) looks over at the strong girl on top of the building.

<font color = white>&#34;How did she even get up there?See.....i&#39;m convinced she has something supernatural about her.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) a single glance went toward the intense youngster before he looked back at Yuuto, the words processing in his head for a second before he quickly shook it and covered his ears, not wanting to listen to any lesson.

<font color = white>&#34;No...Don&#39;t do it..&#34;</font>He mumbled.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: But what happened!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Huh? What's going on?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Not sure, trying to explain what went on in class yesterday.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Oh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) smiled as she clambered down the building. Alas, she topples down to the cobblestone floor below. <font color = white>&#34;I got in a fight!&#34;</font> She roars as she lifts herself from the ground, unphased and unharmed.

<font color = white>&#34;I got in a fight and it was fun!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) heard the small mumble from the dark haired boy, and saw him shaking his head. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you only have to gain from listening to this kid. Trust me, it&#39;s not that bad.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;We just saw the Hokage Manor and the Fire Monument with some explanations from the teacher. Then we had to climb a mountain, the exercise had us helping each other.&#34;</font> They had formed a system pretty easily. <font color = white>&#34;We just made a system to help get everyone to the top, helping pull and throw people upwards.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t terrible.

<font color = white>&#34;Somethings will be easier by just relying on your classmates like that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) nodded his head a few times, pretending to listen to Yuuto as he kept his hands on his ears, blocking out all the noise, when he seemed like he was done talking he lowered his hands.

<font color = white>&#34;Wowwww...Sounds cool.&#34;</font> he stated, raising a hand to block his yawn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would scratch their head while looking at their sister wonder why she was in the streets fighting people.,but either way she was proud of her super buff sister.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah!I&#39;ll have to treat you out for some pork buns later then.....wait.&#34;</font>the gambler would wrap their arm around the Uchiha<font color = white>&#34;Heeey Yuuto wanna treat my sister and myself to some pork buns?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Paled orbs bounce from the group to the one who had just abruptly collided with the ground, clearly lacking the skill to land like a shinobi would. Her arms crossed, canting her visage ever so slightly to one side, <font color = white>&#34;Top of the academy, but landing like that... Hmh.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Was the fight with that red-haired boy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yeah, Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Dog..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Treat us to some pork buns!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was listening to everyone and was about to answer Kumirama until he noticed a familiar sigh. His hand was instantly raised and pointed at the dog. <b><font color = white>&#34;You!&#34;</font></b>

The lost dog, this time he was going to catch it! He charged at it! That 50 ryo bounty was his!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) ignores the loudness. <font color = white>&#34;Good morning. Most in the arena have fallen to the lull of sleep.&#34;</font>

She idly watched the dog, surely this could be entertaining if nothing else.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) did no move a muscle, it merely tilted its head to the side in confusion as the overconfident kid charged at it. With a dumb look on its face as he pants joyfully.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Is that your dog?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) gasped at the appearance of the dog. He casually waved in his direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Cute..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Hmm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) got in front of the dog and instantly tried to swipe the dog from the ground as gently as he could, because he obviously didn&#39;t want to hurt it. He just needed to catch it and return it to an old lady as far as he remembers.

<font color = white>&#34;No, not my dog, he&#39;s wanted though! He&#39;s Miss Kome&#39;s missing dog, apparently he goes missing every week. It was on the newspaper. Me and some others tried to catch him last night but we failed.&#34;</font> He didn&#39;t expect him to be caught this easily.

Yuuto had been sure this dog was the most elusive creature ever until now.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, noticing everyone&#39;s focus was on something else, a small smirk formed under his mask. First he took a few steps back then if no one noticed his getaway it turned into a full blown sprint somewhere he could take a nap.

<font color = white>&#34;Wow...what a cool looking dog...&#34;</font> he mumbled...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) gets her pokeball ready.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Oh, get him!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Powerful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) froze in place, he felt a scary presence behind him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) rushes toward the dog in a manic fashion, clearly intent on having fun moreso than actually capturing it. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (yo dogmin, love your icon
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Looks like you found the dog, huh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) shrugged as she would similarly make her way over, arms crossed behind her back as she drew nearer and nearer. Caution was stuck to her features, as she didn&#39;t quite want to touch a random dog. That would get her hands and attire dirty - or worse... catching something from it.

<font color = white>&#34;It looks like it bites.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) was picked up without no issue. It seemed pretty dumb, just looking at all the new faces he has never seen before with clueless stares. Even with the intense youngster rushing at it, the dog seemed to have no common sense or any feel for potential danger... Or what it that confident in it's own abilities...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) yells: Urrrf!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: That thing is gonna bite you, Yuuto.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) <font color = white>&#34;Let me see the dog!&#34;</font> Shisorama demands as she attempts to rip the poor thing from Yuuto&#39;s grasp. <font color = white>&#34;I want to hold him!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) found this to be incredibly easy... either way, one thing was certain. <font color = white>&#34;So fluffy!&#34;</font> He wanted to squeeze this dog in a hug, but didn&#39;t want to hurt him. <font color = white>&#34;Let him bite me then, look at him! It would be worth it.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Nope, you can&#39;t hold him.&#34;</font> He told Shishorama. <font color = white>&#34;I caught him, try next week.&#34;</font> She should know by now she was not stronger than him, even if she tried to get the dog from his grasp, his arms simply wouldn&#39;t budge.

<font color = white>&#34;Now... Kohaku, any clue where we take this thing. I can get the bounty and treat all of us for some pork buns.&#34;</font> He nodded at Kumirama, he would get her those pork buns she seemed to want.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) was like a motionless doll as the two bickered for him. Clearly, he wasn't fighting it at all.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) rested her hands behind her head, watching this scene, unfortunately it was no where near as entertaining as she had hoped.. such is life it seems.

<font color = white>&#34;What a calm dog..&#34;</font> She observed the fluffy mass, perhaps it was only waiting for the right time?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) continues to wave at the dog, he was just happy to be there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) rubbed the side of his cheek as he watched Shishorama be herself, acting before thinking in the situation. At least this one did&#39;t seem to endanger anyone, just a puppy with a lack of survival instincts. As for  where to take the dog really?

He&#39;d shrug, <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know- The lady&#39;s house probably, at least that&#39;s what common sense dictate but i don&#39;t know where she even lives.&#34;</font> The younger Uchiha admitted, he was actually looking around through the town to get a read of the other areas outside the Uchiha Compound.

He&#39;s at least foud everything of importance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) fell asleep, snoring every once in a while.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) already felt regret at the thought of returning this dog... but he can't keep it... he can't.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So cute..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) would take a few steps nearer, squinting at the dog as she inspects it for visible signs of rabies or something. She heard every animal you see running around has that, and it&#39;s not pleasant.

<font color = white>&#34;Then it looks like you have a new pet for now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tried and tried to get Yuuto budge. He was stronger, sure, but he wasn&#39;t so much stronger that she couldn&#39;t budge him at all. She only two letter grades away!  <font color = white>&#34;Come on! Let me hold him!&#34;</font> She complains loudly.

If something didn&#39;t give, physical violence might be the only option.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) skips her way down the bridge&#39;s guard rail, using it as a gymnast would a balance-beam. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hmm, hum, ha-hum, hm, hm-- hm??&#34;</font> 

She noticed a collective of dog admirers beyond the end. And-- <font color = white>&#34;Hey! You guys found the always-runs-away pooch! Cool beans.&#34;</font> A hop sends her back to solid ground. She posts up in the general vicinity, deciding it best to keep her distance. Animals hated being crowded. Right? Right. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: You're gonna break the dog...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm not!
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) asks: Can..I pet him...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It didn't even try to run away.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just let him take a swim. He'll be fine after.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: You should bathe it.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I don't think it would stop you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) That was true, but damn was she stubborn! <font color = white>&#34;You know I would&#39;ve actually let you hold the dog if you simply asked nicely, right?&#34;</font> He just squinted at the girl as his arms actually began to budge.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s sleeping right now, when he wakes up, I&#39;ll let you, now stop yelling, Shishorama.&#34;</font> Now he had to treat her like she was a younger kid. <font color = white>&#34;You can hold him before we find the old lady or when he wakes up, until then,, calm down.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And yeah, Hanako, wanna help us go look for the owner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) shuffles his feet toward the sleeping dog, intent on petting it's fluffy head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) immediately relents and allows her arms to flop lifelessely at her side. <font color = white>&#34;Can I please hold him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So soft..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Is Senju, Kumirama among you guys?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's my sister!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Kumirama, Komo-sense is calling for you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was alive to witness this historical moment. Shishorama actually relented. She gave up on something, he had convinced her to step down. <font color = white>&#34;See? Was that so hard?&#34;</font> With that said, he gently slid the dog onto her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Sensei. We found the dog, where do we take him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I didn't even know you had a sister...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Sure. I'm the forty-first best person in the village at finding dog owners. I'll lend you my skills.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I haven't seen my sister at all.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Alright, Shishorama, hand the dog over to Sensei, then we can go for some pork buns.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hm. My skills say Sensei will handle the rest. Mission accomplished.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Good job, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I did my best! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah, here's the other half of the academy.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Yes, Batsu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) was a polite young woman at her core. She had no need to be violent against her friends unless absolutely necessary. To ask and use manners was not beneath her. 

<font color = white>&#34;Nice!&#34;</font> She says as she takes hold of the big fluffy boy. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s so fluffy!&#34;</font> She shrieks in excitement before handing the pup to the Sensei. <font color = white>&#34;Here you go, Sensei. Yuuto was able to grab him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Farewell...doggy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i love this dog icon
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (looks a lot like my dog irl)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Were you at the lesson?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) asks: We had a lesson already?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I had a supervised spar today Sensei! I did you proud!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: You mean the rock climbing?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) had no idea if Komo would actually be proud or not. She just assumed that would be the case.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It wwas mainly a team work exercise.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Well, how did you do?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I was carried up, sadly my strength didn't do much for climbing. I helped pull people up once there with a group.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) picked up the pup with her lazed eyes gazed upon the creature. It seem like she was all to used to this puppy, clearly did not have the same effects of its presence effecting her at all.

The puppy seemed familar with the Chuunin, easily hopping into her hands and climbing on top of her head as if it was one of its hangout places.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, Ko... Time for you to go back home.&#34;</font> She said, digging into her pocket and handing the &#39;bounty&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see. Unfortunate but shows true teamwork.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would clear their throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Soooo Yuuta what about those pork buns.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tossed the money to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, <font color = white>&#34;I hope we deal more with Chakra next lesson, while my Physical Strength isn&#39;t anything too special I can make that up with my chakra control.&#34;</font>

He was more than sure of that.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: We shall see.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: There goes that word again. Chakra...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) nodded at the dog, bidding it goodbye with a final pet. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we should go for those pork buns now-&#34;</font> Then he caught the money tossed his way. <font color = white>&#34;My treat! Let&#39;s go?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Kibo, you don't know what chakra is?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...Makes sense for him.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Heeey there, Maya. Who's your friend?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yup! Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh? No idea.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I think it's more becase we are from a clan, yes... It's an energy Shinobi use for Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, and even enhancing Taijutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: An unknown friend. I see, I see.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) approaches with pocketed hands...!

He briefly hesitates, but eventually nods a couple of times.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know what it is, no. Am I supposed to?&#34;</font> He questions, while taking steps forth.

He raises a hand to high five Hanako as he walks past.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, friend..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Where is the weapon shop?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It can be morhed into a physical shape if you train hard enough, too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Friend. Make yourself known! Oh-- hi, other friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I've been demoted from friend to other friend, it seems.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) plops his bottom onto the wooden bench, kicking his feet along.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hajime of the twenty ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: So it's energy, right? What's it look like?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Ah.. we my introductions missed previously..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) moves along with puppy in head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How goes your day?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It's going well! I just learned another piece of key knowledge that I need to beat the clans at their own game. This Chakra stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ha ha! Of course not. I miss nothing. Ever.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It's kind of bright, and blue-ish.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) missed a lot. All the time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) held a hand to her forehead for a moment, with a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Okiku. I was walking around the academy stuff with you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ohh..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I remember that!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Certainly..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) barely remembers what she had for breakfast this morning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah yes, this is Okiku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wwould make a flame between his hands to demonstrate, <font color = white>&#34;My Chakra takes on the properties of fire like all of the Uchiha- It&#39;s used to use Katon based Ninjutsu.&#34;</font> He stated before putting the flame out, the demonstration was simple but more effective than his explainations of it as a whole.

<font color = white>&#34;It basically runs through all of us, taking different forms based on the individual or in some cases the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hello, Okiku.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Fire...?!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Ah, right. Uchiha are known for fire.
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Whoa..
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: The same could be said, I know none of your names either.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Burning down buildings and stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Well! It's good to meet you! 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Arsonists.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm not a sponge, don't listen to the rumors.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Terrorist.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Kohaku of the Uchiha, pleasure to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: TerroristS, even.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Kibo, Hajime. Good to meet you too.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Mmm... depends of how the flame is weilded.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Are flames not for burning
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ?!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Good to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Come with me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: They always are.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Fire destroys, and allowws thigs to regrow from the ashes... So it's not only for burning.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Here are some people at least.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It does cook delicious food.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Huh
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'll find a way to beat your fire, though.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Things were already growing before they were burnt.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Just so you know.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: You won't, Hajime.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Sure will.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: As long as there's a will, there's a way...!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: You don't even know what chakra looks like.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: So? 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I believe in Hajime. He'll find a way to punch fire. One day.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: See? I've got fans already..!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) asks: Hm, what does my chakra look like?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Punch the fire and lose an arm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Are you asking me?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'll find a way to do it, that doesn't involve me losing an arm.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just put some water on it.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Water does seem to solve a lot of problems for you, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: It keeps everyone alive. Doesn't it?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Water's pretty cool.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Mostly.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Mhm!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Just speaking aloud.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Don't touch his hand. He doesn't wash them.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Is that true?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Look at him.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: She's a liar.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: What do you see when you look at me?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Water can fix that too, Hajime.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Water can fix her being a liar?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) looks at the photograph of his ninja info card, which did look like he was holding a piece of poop..

<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Do you wash them appropriately?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: I think so?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) twitched an eyebrow as she stared towards the redhead.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah... so when was the last time?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Like, about fifteen minutes ago.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Do you not know where you are or where to go?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) stares blankly, processing this information for a good amount of time.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) gestured towards the river.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll fist bump if you wash your hands, but for now my name is Maya. I&#39;m a resident of the Gorumba orphanage.&#34;</font>

Despite being an orphan she seemed weirdly well dressed in expensive clothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Conf ued.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Do your parents hate you to name you that?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I left, though.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Sad.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: They also forced me out the compound into this dire place.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's okay. Lost is a fine name.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: And now you're found!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: All because it's my duty in my clan to be Shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Well, nice to meet--- what clan?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: When all I wanna do is sleep.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, well you're in the right place. We're all students-to-be.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Not Hajime.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Sensei went, like.. up the bridge I think?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I shall join the academy to fail.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: What about Hajime?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: I believe she's still in search of a medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hmm? To fail?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: She mentioned something about them having hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Don't worry about it.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: If I fail, then I can sleep as much as I want.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: It's a perfect plan.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: But.. they'll make you take extra classes if you fail!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: That means less sleep!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh there she is.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: No...they wouldn't..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Keep runnin' your mouth. I can't wait to hear how you had to explain that someone not from a clan got better academy grades than you to your parents.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: She must've found the medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Isn't that right, Sensei?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Failures have to take make-up classes!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: That is a lie right..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hmph. 
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Lots of talking...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I don't think make up classes would be needed, if you just got it right the first time.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ...but there is make up if you do fail then.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) yells: See, I've never had to do any make up classes!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: ... I've not done any classes.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Just don't fail.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Simple.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Komo sensei.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Did you get my registration?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The first class was just a team work exercise...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Senju, Kumirama. Are they here?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Uh.. Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) falls down onto his knees, laying down on the ground. closing his eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;...This darn academy..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I am Senju.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Uchiha, Batsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: It's okay, Lost! You can find your way to success!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) walked up towards the teacher, slipping a ryo in her sash.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t fail.&#34;</font>

A smile given towards the old Shinobi before dropping her voice lower in a whisper, but still audible to all those around if they listened.

<font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s more where that&#39;s from if I pass with straight A grades.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Hanako, how well do you think you'll do?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: See? The first step's already here. Sign up to join the Academy with Sensei--
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Does success equal sleeping..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I did, I see your name here.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I'm Kaguya...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) looks away. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll do good,&#34;</font> she murmured, lying through her teeth. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I look forward to see you top of the class.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: y-Yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ha ha.. haaa..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: If you don't we'll help you pass.... Somehow.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked at the single ryo as she simply threw it into the river.

<font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t no wishing well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) crossed her arms as she turns to walk past Hajime, briefly sticking her tongue out before halting closer to the others, <font color = white>&#34;I think I&#39;ll have a better time watching you open your grades and hide from me afterwards. Because you did worse.&#34;</font> She had to clarify that last part... Obviously.

<font color = white>&#34;My clan only excels and succeeds after all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) leaned back up, staring at the sky before sighing.

<font color = white>&#34;I will get my family back for this...&#34;</font> He mumbled, raising a single fist in the air.,</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Seems they are doing the bonding.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) raised a single eyebrow, slipping into her pouch as she removes a wad of of over three-hundred ryo. In a hushed voice she spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;So, what&#39;s the price then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked over at the blissful youth.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you Kumirama?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I'm rich.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I have no price.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Kumirama is not over here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) squints, and soon clenches a fist..! Her gesture draws a slightly reddened face from the young man, in frustration.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll see about that.&#34;</font>

He turns away from her, and soon forces a smile as he takes steps towards the two girls in the distance.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. I&#39;m Hajime. Nice to meet you both.&#34;</font>

A single fist extends forth, towards them. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Prove you're rich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looks at her fancy clothes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) with a sigh she&#39;d instead remove the largest fish she had recently caught, handing it over towards the instructor before stepping back next to Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do great at school, teacher.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Hm... Acceptable.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: She does look rich.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Hey, hey. Komo-sensei. How'd you get rich?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) glanced left. 
She glanced right.

It looks like the coast was clear. As long as she ignored the twenty eyeballs within the vicinity. Conditions were perfect. She tip-toed her way over to the guard rail. 

<i>Aaaand</i> slowly started to climb over the obstacle. Her eyes were glued to that discarded single ryo bill. She could buy some candy with that. What a waste! To let it flow away on the current!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Hm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) grabs the raw fish that was given to her by the kombu green haired girl. She savagly bite into the raw fish in its mid section, devouring everything until stuffing the rest of the fish into her mouth, tail end last.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) wasn't sure if she should be frightened or impressed by the display.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) bumped a swollen fist against his.

<font color = white>&#34;Kamiya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Working hard is a good start. Finding more doors to make money.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Being born rich helps too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;I am Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font> She turns to the bright boy and extends her hand. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you as well, Hajime.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's your fist swollen?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) watched Hanako go after the ryo, he didn't care- No one else seemed to care, therefore it was fair game for the Platinum Blonde to go fishing for it. Though he stopped staring to wwatch the Headmistress become a savage and potentially poison herself  to mortify Children.

It seemed to be working.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) does not notice the antics of the headmistress, nor the missed opportunity of nabbing 1 ryo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, watching how the women just devoured a raw fish, He thought for a second, Just staring at her before nodding.

<font color = white>&#34;Do all girls eat like?&#34;</font> He questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Not girls, but real women.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Impressive.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) flops over the guard rail, entirely lacking in grace, and sploshed into the river. 

A minute later, she emerged, blowing on the recovered bill, trying and failing to air-dry it. A soggy set of sandal-prints were left in her trail as she made her way back to Position A! Lurking beneath the street light. 

Drenched, but the grin she wore says she's elated by her mission accomplished. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I pulled my finger out.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Entirely.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's bad.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You shouldn't do that.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I think you could win a eating competition.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Then she poked Shishorama with the bone.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't think it is as bad as it seems.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hard core.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Good work, Hanako. Stealth is a virtue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: w-- You saw?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) steps away on that note, shuddering, even.

Was he speaking to some sort of savage?

<font color = white>&#34;G-good luck in the academy..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I mean, uh..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. saw what? I did nothing.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't like his face.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ?!?!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: I see everything, I've been practicing.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I would pass on eating contests.. They are a waste of food.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's kinda rude.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) pulled out a fish of her own as she stared towards it. She&#39;d take a few seconds of simply gazing at the fish before starting to copy the teacher as she devoured it all bar the bone which would be deposited into a nearby trashcan.

However astute eyes would notice that whilst the fish she had taken out was raw, every bite would be charred and mostly cooked as they entired her mouth. The Hyuugas would clearly notice her pumping katon attuned chakra into the fish to flashcook it.

<font color = white>&#34;Now I&#39;m a real woman, like sensei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: I heard that, y'know?

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That is the true test of womanhood...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm...a waste. I guess that makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's okay, I don't like you either. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yawns while trotting down the road.
He glances over to Kamiya, standing next to his sister.

<font color = white>&#34;You.&#34;</font> He scowls ot the both of them, though mostly to Kamiya for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: You looked at her weirdly. I didn't appriecate that.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Usually people descale and debone the Sashimi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) giggled at Sakuya&#39;s words. She approached Hajime and drew her nails down her cheeks, drawing blood--

And then, Shun&#39;ichi appeared.

<font color = white>&#34;What?&#34;</font> She spat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: A true women it's it whole I've been told.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) paused. 

Her limited attention span was drawn to the events taking place nearby. Aversion, repulsion, and every sickened emotion in between creased and wrinkled her face, watching someone eat a fish of all things in such a animalistic manner!

<font color = white>&#34;Gross. Fish are gross! Don&#39;t you know where that thing&#39;s been, Maya?!&#34;</font>
She waved her arms frantically in protest!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares.

His eyes widen upon seeing the illogical behavior of Kamiya, who draws blood with her own nails. 

<font color = white>&#34;Umm... Kamiya, does that not hurt...?&#34;</font> He asks, though the sheer display has him weirded out, incredibly so.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held out a single seal, disappearing.

<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you hanging around that thing, sis?&#34;</font> He initiates.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) looks to Maya as a fish was withdrawn from somewhere and stared at, <font color = white>&#34;Wait, that&#39;s not good for you--&#34;</font> The Hyuuga grimaced as the Gorumba&#39;s mouth opened to chow down - only to relax all of a sudden and exhale. All tension flows away, like that ryo bill in the river would have if not &#39;saved&#39; by Hanako.

She was puffing flames to cook it at the very last second... Scary, but... Not as poisonous as it could have been. The fish probably had scales and everything though, gross.

<font color = white>&#34;...I think fish isn&#39;t for me anymore.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) removed a napkin from her pouch as she began to delicately dab at her lips in order to clean them of any fishy debris before turning her attention towards Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;This river, I caught it myself...&#34;</font>

A simple answer to a straight forward questio as her head cocked to the side in a curious manner.

<font color = white>&#34;And it&#39;s a fresh as it comes, orphans can&#39;t be picky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) swiped her eyes over at Hajime. The cuts aren&#39;t particularly deep, but she bled softly from the rake all the same. It doesn&#39;t take long for it to roll down to her jawline, and then drip to the cobblestone beneath.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course it hurts.&#34;</font> She replied, before moving to face the ugly, green-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m going to hurt you really badly.&#34;</font> She promised to Shun&#39;ichi.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) hugged her sister tightly, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for my loss! I love you, Kumi!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: We can train you to last longer underwater.

<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: There is a lake right there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) jumped from his seat. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, look at the bright side, they were probably just bluffing or trying to scare you!&#34;</font> He reached a hand to place it on Kumirama&#39;s shoulder. <font color = white>&#34;If they wanted to drown you, you wouldn&#39;t have escaped.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Oh my god!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: You're right!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Oh no.

<font color = white>&#34;W-wait..! Unspin..? Wah..!&#34;</font>

The unspinning has the opposite effect and he finds himself teetering even more, until he threatens to collapse right onto Hanako..! A hand rises to cover his mouth, as well.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Yeahhhhhhhh, I will gladly drown you.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: And help.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Oooh so they essentially pulled a prank on you?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) released her sister with a smile. <font color = white>&#34;Just kidding. You&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between them.

<font color = white>&#34;Guys, we can&#39;t let the old geezer pull a prank on Kumi like this and not get his get back. Right? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Mm?
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: Sounds... Risky.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) scratches his chin as he thinks to himself.

<font color = white>&#34;I got it. We can draw some mustaches on some picture or a poster. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Right!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) pulled a chair out of her pocket and took a seat on the bridge to watch the commotions until something else happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: - Wait, no.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Not right!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: I will be drowned next class.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: But he pranked Kumi. That's like declaring prank wars.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: ...Drowned?
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Don't tell me you don't wanna be prank wars champion?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Next class? Don't worry, we'll be there for you.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) asks: When is the next class?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) collapses to the ground, and though he keeps his mouth covered for a few moments, he soon breathes a sigh of relief.

He had avoided death itself. Or the death of his self-image for the foreseeable future.

Only after a few moments, does he tilt his head backwards while lying on the ground to finally realize that the fight was still ongoing.

<font color = white>&#34;W-woah... They&#39;re jumping that kid... &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Hopefully soon.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Shisho if I die make sure i'm burried with a nice outfit.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I will!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: What qualifies as a nice outfit?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: She knowns.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: It's the one in my close.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) received a bunch of fish. She released them back to their natural habitat. 

They lifelessly float away on the current, dumped back into the river. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: It won't come to that, but rest assured..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You'll look fabulous!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: ...Or we stop her from dying.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) reached over the counter to grab the icecreams that were stored in the chef&#39;s freezer. <font color = white>&#34;By the way, I know it doesn&#39;t make it better, but I saved you that green tea ice cream you wanted.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Good.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Welp pass me that green tea ice cream!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Another person that likes Green Tea? This is good.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: You can have my seat, Kumi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) slides the icecream over to the empty seat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Enjoy it.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I must go!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: And there she goes.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: Probably excited about the class in thrity minutes.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: I-I am.

I&#39;m sure we should be making ourselves to class, but we have time to spare.&#34;</font> He stated mixing honey into his cup before taking a sip, turning towards Yakeru and Yuuto.

<font color = white>&#34;What do you think class will be about today?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Probably soemthing that has to do with me drowning.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kumirama(The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) OOCs: (Something*)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) sighed and scratched his head. <font color = white>&#34;Considering the location of the class... they said Kumirama&#39;s gonna drown... and the fact we just started the academy and have to learn the basic jutsus... we&#39;re probably gonna have to learn how to swim or walk on water.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;By the way, now that I think about all this, I can now confidently say.&#34;</font> He spoke with a sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Kumirama is not gonna be drowning alone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) delivers the line that had gotten him stomped out at the orphanage many times.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) took the final bite of his porkbun, finishing it off before swallowing it down.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not sure, I do remember her mentioning a mental workout.&#34;</font> he mentions before taking a sip of his juice.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: And c-chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) yells: Woo! Chakra!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I. Am. Ready.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) will definitely be drowning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: I think it'll be fun.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) breathes a sigh of relief once he sees that yet another stomping had been averted..! No doubt thanks to his efforts, as he had told them that stomping was wrong, and to cease. Clearly, this was a victory for him.

He rises to his feet after a few moments, still a bit wobbly, but he smiles regardless.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;all wanna&#39; head to that lesson?&#34;</font> He asks, before his gaze focuses upon the one referred to as Shun.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, man! You alright?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: If you're good at chakra control.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: I'll leave this one to you Kohaku, make sure to drag me back to the shore if I drift away.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I will, I have a fishing rod for the emergency.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: M-my dad taught me a small bit to get me ready.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Just a bit? Guess we should be near the same level then on that.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I'm not actually done my own training in Chakra Control.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: What about you Kumirama? Confident in your control?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Nope!
