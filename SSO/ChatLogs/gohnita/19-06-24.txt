<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) says: Mmmm.. A little tired, and baffled. I need to pay more attention to what's been going on.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh you sound like your abit aloof
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Whats your name?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) asks: Hmm.. Maybe. I'm Suzaku. What about you?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) placed her hands on her hips. <font color = white>&#34;Im Chobina Akimichi. Its nice to meet you.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh, you look like you're kinda related to Reilin, Suzaku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) brought her balled-up fists to her eyes, rubbing them gently as if the morning light was too much to bear. She blinked, trying to focus, and as her vision cleared, she found herself squinting at Chobina.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you too, Chobin.,&#34;</font> she said, her voice still held the softness of sleep. She lowered her body into a formal, polite bow, a gesture of respect that seemed almost out of place in the haze of early morning.

Rising slowly, she hesitated, her mind drifting to the conversation she had overheard earlier. Her face adopted a puzzled expression, and she bit her lip, nervousness flickering across her features. The corner of her lips twitched as she struggled with the question she felt compelled to ask.

Fingers twiddling, she finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, <font color = white>&#34;Is it true someone was beheaded?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) I nod my head. <font color = white>&#34;I wasnt there thankfully, but I heard about it. It was pretty day but thats what criminals get.&#34;</font>

The cubby girl was tired herself but she was head to bed rather than waking up. She had a bit of time to spare though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was trying to forget everything that had happened the day before, but the moment someone brought it up all the bad memories came flooding her at once, emotionally overwhelming her. The girl put her hand on her stomach while avoiding looking at anyone, her gaze fixated on the water in front of her.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, they executed a prisoner and made us watch, but that wasn&#39;t the worst part. It was right before that when things got ugly. It still makes me feel sick thinking about it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah... It was a bit more than just a beheading...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) yawned into her palm <font color = white>&#34;That is so. Such acts will keep us safe, as I was explaining to Hideo here.&#34;</font> she gave the boy a wink. As if they shared some secret. 

<font color = white>&#34;I have considered taking up the practice myself. If we behead anyone who faces us then noone will question Iwagakure when we step outside our walls.&#34;</font> she yawned again and looked up at the sky.

<font color = white>&#34;About time I rest however....good day children.&#34;</font> she say and give them all a bow before making her way to a bench to snooze.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: How much more do you need?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Flame in the eyes, determination, etcetera. Not actual flames. No... you youngsters with elemental ninjutsu would be troublesome.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just three-hundred left.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: C'mere Fubuki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked up to Hideo. <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) reaches into his pocket and produces a very crumpled wad of, what was probably, three-hundred ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Here, get a super cool sword.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at the wad of money and immediately shaked her head while waving her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;No, you don&#39;t need to do it really! I appeciate it but like, it&#39;s a lot.&#34;</font> Fubuki spoke quickly due to being flustered, it was an unexpectedly cool moment from Hideo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and gestures with the money again,

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, spending money makes me happy.&#34;</font>

Lowering the money slightly he smiles. How blessed was he that getting money was his primary goal solely because spending it made him happier... He, however, does not miss an opportunity to be slightly snide,

<font color = white>&#34;Even though you&#39;re sometimes mean and lame. You <i>do</i> need a sword so you can actually fight and stuff. All I need is my dad to stop being lazy and teach me jutsu.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Aw, Hideo's being noble.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm always noble!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched her head while thinking about it, she couldn&#39;t even jokingly bully him. So many people had already helped her and she couldn&#39;t help people back. Eventually she caved in and sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay fine. I accept it if you insist. But for my next katana I&#39;ll try to make the money on my own -- and if you need ANY help, you ask me. You got that?&#34;</font>

She stepped forward and put her hands on her hips, looking at him seemingly upset though her face betrayed her intentions, which were just being serious about her promise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (GRAHHH)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) nods his head and hands her the money, <font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;m immediately calling in my favor; be less mean to me.&#34;</font>

With that handled, he spins to face the old man. Using his still out-stretched hand, now freed of money, to point at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I totally heard you say us having elemental jutsu would be &#39;troublesome&#39;! I&#39;m gonna learn to throw fireballs <b>and</b> mountains and it&#39;ll be the complete opposite of troublesome! It&#39;ll be... helpful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately nodded and grabbed the money, putting it alongside her stash. Just enough for the katana she had ordered.

<font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;ll only be mean if you&#39;re mean to me though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Damn, I guess that's fair.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I appreciate the donation but I won't become a punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have my word I won't start shit though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I would never treat you like one! I'm usually the punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Heh, true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Trust me man I may laugh and smile but it tooootallly sucks most of the time.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If it makes you feel better, I was always joking. Sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, I figured. Thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think Tsuneko may be the only one that actually means it... I 'unno.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nah, she's messing with you too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I don't think anyone actually hates anyone else here.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hrm, I hope so.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) rested his good eye on Hideo while the other glances at Fubuki. He&#39;d let out a troubled sigh as he thought about his days of fighting against ninjutsu.

<font color = white>&#34;Helpful how?&#34;</font>, he questioned as he removed a glass from his sleeve and quickly took a sip.

<font color = white>&#34;You youngsters are something else.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I 'unno I figure throwing mountains could probably help someone somehow. Lemmie get there first. I'll worry about what I do when I'm there, when I'm there!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, very true.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw the man look at them each with a separate eye and couldn&#39;t get that mental image out of her mind. It just might be more traumatizing than yesterday.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, what would be helpful then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Maybe someone will ask me to relocate a mountain range or something heroic like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like, literally carving a path through the mountains or something. That'd probably be super helpful.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Took much plate shifting with cause an earthquake.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: will*

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Swords.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fair. But I bet I could just like... rip chunks out of the mountain super easy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Carve a valley with my barehands...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like diggin' through sand at the beach...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) asks: My idea of being helpful is selfish. I would make sure I'd use ninjutsu to protect the crops and livestock! How could I sleep with a full stomach if there's no food?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah but that's like- obvious stuff! I thought wanted unique examples or something!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm a simple man.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: My way of being helpful will be cutting down anyone who attacks us.

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Damn right, if you're going to reach your -goal- then you're gonna have to leave no stone unturned.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think it might be literal stones when it comes to doton training.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, I see what you did there.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Say, Old Man Tooki, what kinds of stuff did you do when you were 'cleaning up the streets'?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was full of energy and brimming with taijutsu mastery.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was gaining experience left and right, finishing fights fast.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) swiftly sent two strikes Eastward. Loud pops from joints, muffled by cloth, bounced from off the mountains.

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Too much ninjutsu.

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: At that point, I think I reached the peak of taijutsu. Swiftness helped me avoid certain things to close in.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wonder how fast I have to throw a mountain for someone to be unable to just... avoid it with swiftness...

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: It focuses on training while semi-conscious.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) grabbed the somewhat long stick and nodded, before clearing her throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright Himeki, let&#39;s go. I&#39;ll show you what a real swordswoman can do.&#34;</font>

She took off her shoes and walked in the water since she wasn&#39;t good enough to actually use suimen.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I see training a very complex problem.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: And sometimes it's hard to solve it while amongst it.

<font color = white>&#34;Phew...it&#39;s kinda hot in here actually...maybe I should--&#34;</font>

Then she&#39;d turn around and quickly fit the stick through the hole. She used no strength but if someone was truly peeping then she&#39;d be able to find out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: But this practice makes a weakness of mine a strength.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) smirked and left the stick in the hole, as a warning incase someone tried peeking again. Hearing the boy collapse to the floor confirmed her suspicions.

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for letting me know there was someone there Himeki.&#34;</font> She said before slowly walking back to outside the water.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Welp, I&#39;m gettin&#39; in tha&#39; water.&#34;</font> the teen said. She decided to change inside, though. Folding her kimono and putting it away before returning in a towel.

The girl took a dip into the water, swimming around freely.

<font color = white>&#34;So who else is lookin&#39; forward to becomin&#39; a Genin?&#34;</font> she inquired.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) used her free hand to move one of her raven locks behind her ear before commenting.

He removed silky fabrics before walking out to the male area with a towel and shorts on. The reticent young boy slipped into the water, placing a palm onto the sand used for decoration. He would start practicing imbuing it with his Chakra.

After accomplishing that, he would shift it around without weaving a single seal.

<font color = white>&#34;......&#34;</font> The reticent young boy doesn&#39;t speak a word, instead deciding to blind silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Hm. Old man, did you take an order for tea?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Uh
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: i should probably..see to that that..eye..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) squinted her eyes and stared at the boy with malicious intent...but she would end up doing nothing. <font color = white>&#34;Just don&#39;t try anything funny.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) comes to a stand. His index fingers acts as a bookmark as he closes his book around it. Calm footsteps carry him atop the water before he&#39;d scale over the fence as well.

  <font color = white>&#34;What do you sell?&#34;</font>, he questions again.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: What don't we sell?
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) yells: ?!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: SUP.

Once done, she hopped over to Hanaka.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) yells: of course ye have!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) blinked in confusion, is a lady granting permission to someone else so they can peep?!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) yells: You want it! We have it! You broke it, we can fix it!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) gulps at Fubuki. He kneels and picks up a small twig from the ground. <font color = white>&#34;Ahh.. here it is, my thing.. this is what I was looking for before................&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I'm gonna put you all in a pit in a second here if someone doesn't tell me where my tea is.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Too crowded. I can't concentrate. Can we find a room or something, with chairs Junji-San.
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: .....

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) chuckled a bit. <font color = white>&#34;Oh yeah, a twig. I already gave it to you earlier remember?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What good place?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Do you have..

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm in need of a Tonfa.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Who did you order tea from, young lady?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: for a conversation
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) performs a bow, though it was hard to tell if she was serious or not-- her tone held a certain arrogance covered in innocence. <font color = white>&#34;Please. If you would be so gracious.. My poor legs will break underneath the harsh stress.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Lady Tomoe went to Akihabara with my order...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) nods like fifty times. <font color = white>&#34;Yes, and now that I have explained why I was here, I&#39;m relieved of all suspicion.&#34;</font> He makes for the cave exit, picking up speed. <font color = white>&#34;Farewell pretty spa girls!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I thought you were the caravan delivering it..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: You're asking weapon merchants for tea?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Bye bye.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) seemed to be lucid, it happened usually when the job demaned it. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Why was he on his underwear?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I can check for you when I return to Akihabara.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) asks: You're weapon merchants..?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Bow and arrow kind of bow, not the hair bow kind.  How much do bows cost?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) sighs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Nine, ninety-nine.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: As I've said.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hm?

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: We did kinda walk into their village once though.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) It's over, so much for drama. The reticent young boy exhaled in a raspy tone, closing his eyes to concentrate on the chakra previously imbued into the sand. Manipulating it, he used it to turn on a light in the spa, as the cave's darkness was giving him the creeps.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I see... well. I guess everyone's clearing out.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: See you under the sun.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) had no idea Hitoshi was actually in the spa all along so she began walking outside - most likely she missed the message.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Reilin spotted.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Well, yeah. Makes sense. That water's probably extra filthy.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Yeah, blood.  Guts.  Dirt.  Vomit.  And every nasty thing you can imagine is probably in that water.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Do you think he gets out to pee or...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: ...

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: So.. those Traveling Merchants. They were looking for approval to do business here? Or something like that? 
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Something like that.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Unfortunately my katana wasn't ready yet...

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I got enough money to buy one yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You've peaked early. All the highs of hitting it big in bets has made your normal like feel mundane.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Clearly the only reasonable choice is to give me five-hundred ryo. To even out your mood.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Now I wonder what she's got planned.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. I have a feeling it might be funny.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Sorry, no can do.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wouldn't actually accept your hard earned ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: It was very hard to get, you're right about that
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Does this make Yurei the strongest Student, by the way..
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A title like that wouldn't bring me any joy or sense of accomplishment at all. He can have it.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'm content enough with improving myself. Bit by bit.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Huh? I spaced out. Did Katora and Yurei spar or something?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: We did. It was fun too.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Damn, shame I missed it. Who won?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: It wwas pretty damn cool.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: They made us look like chumps
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: He'll be a menace on the field, once we start taking on missions beyond the walls. 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Alright what about strongest Genin? That carries a bit of weight
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I surrendered, but it felt more like a draw.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wasn't carrying enough weapons at the time to capitalize on the advantage I created.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Well, least you know what you gotta work on. Right?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: And.. it's too early to tell.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Are you aiming to become the strongest of us, Reilin?

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'll make you look like an even bigger chump.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I respect that energy.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hideo you'll be teaching in the Academy you aren't foolin' anybody
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'll be happy so long as I can make our enemies look like chumps.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: That's the spirit
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Why would I teach the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why would anybody?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: It's all they can do.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Why would a super handsome mountain-throwing hero like me only be able to teach the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: It's a respectable job. Isn't your accomplished Dad doing exactly that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, doesn't mean I wanna do it too.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair enough.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Being a teacher sounds laaaame.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It ain't lame.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I didn't say that it was! I said it *sounds* like it is!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Well I'm telling you what it isn't then!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Kitsumi seems to enjoy her work.

She even counted on her fingers some. <font color = white>&#34;Heeeeeyy....&#34;</font> she came to her conclusion.

<font color = white>&#34;She&#39;s right! If I got 50... And give -you- 50 then I&#39;m at zero..
