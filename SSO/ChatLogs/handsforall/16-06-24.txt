<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) witnessed a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.

It was unusual, something he wasn&#39;t used to, but truthfully it did sound a little fun. It was a raw test of agility and not much else.

  <font color = white>&#34;Seems like it&#39;ll be based mostly on chance if you make it to the end. I&#39;m game for a little flag tag.&#34;</font> He leans off the wall.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So what are streamers?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) hummed softly, not too sure how to come out of this successfully. She doubted she'd win but figured it'd be a good way to pass the time so she moved toward the crate and grabbed herself a velcro belt with one streamer each, strapping both to her hips.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: What are streamers? The red and blue fabric attached to your velcro belts.

Knowing that the masked boy couldn&#39;t use his eagle eye to snipe flags off of belts. With his arms rudimentarily stretched he steps forward! Grabbing a belt and affixing the little streamers to the velcro spots on the belt.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright! I&#39;m gonna win- Wait how do we win this game? Do we collect a bunch of flags?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;A more fitting name would be Royale Rumble.&#34;</font> She said as she stalked closer to the crate to reach in and secure her belt across her waist.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font> she breathed in, slowly inhaling and exhaling. <font color = white>&#34;Who wants to go?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.

(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) squinted a little.  Another game to play, honestly she was currently not a fan of these kinds of games...    Or well, games in general after the one earlier thus she was currently trying to decide to she should take part in this or not.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm...  Choices.&#34;</font>

She whispered to herself softly.  Though she would find herself having a question.

<font color = white>&#34;Um.  If we capture other peoples flags.  Do they count towards our life or just shows we eliminated people?&#34;</font>

This was important.  If it counted towards one&#39;s life, then those who were agile would win.  If it didn&#39;t then those who formed groups and ganged up on others would win...</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Would began to strap her two streamers on her belt, the girl had questioned if she was gonna be able to possibly. Her attention would focus on several thingsf, she wasn&#39;t quite sure what she would do for team mates.. she seemed like she would be alone.. without warning she would run off as well.. 

<font color = white>&#34;Seeing as this free for all.. I am go hide..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: They do not, hurting a enemy in battle doesn't magically restore your wounds silly.
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Protect your streamers at all costs.
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Now grab your belts and get out there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) entered the academy, his jaw tightening slightly. He felt uneasy about being late to the festivities.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) entered the building a little late, be as it may, it doesn't seem like there'd be much need to be present right then and there. The trickster's repetitve instruction echoed throughout the halls, surrounded by the voice of his comradery--essentially, it seemed to be a battle royale of sorts.

A crabby voice caught his attention, recognizing that as his sister-- waved and pointed toward the collection of connecitve belts assigned. Seeing as everyone was taking one, he assumed it was only right for him to grab onto one as well. He bowed to the trickster, took himself a belt, made his way further into the building--shooting a leer at the new Kunoichi in between Cho'Kuome and Mugen. No time to recognize her signature at the moment...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) began to walk forward with belt in hand. If his brother was here, having them to partner up with would be the most ideal strategy. Though with his absence, he would have to find another way to prosper.
  <font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to go toe-to-toe, or be my friend in this game just come stand by me.&#34;</font> Is all he says.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) witnessed a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced,

He mumbles as he recovers from the movement and attempts to dive around the side of his target. Swiping towards his flags as he moves.

<font color = white>&#34;Is that so? I&#39;ve never tried sake, or any drinks for that matter...&#34;</font>

A kick came axing in mere milliseconds after their ribbon hit the floor. Without losing a beat. He&#39;s sharp enough to raise a leg himself, absorbing the kick with his shin, to protect his precious ribbon dancing just beyond it. 

He stamps his fending leg down and skips the other one up, effectively trying to Bicycle Kick their last remaining ribbon in retaliation. 

<font color = white>&#34;...is it fun? Sake. Drinks. My Father warns against them. Dulls the senses.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Sake is light, tasty I would say. I would avoid that foul harsher stuff myself. That is what may floor you&#34;</font> she advised as she more so reached than attacked in a final bid to score at least a single ribbion in the back and forth. 

Could she weaken him for the battles to come?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) moves the offered streamer to show it to the trickster. Using his other hand to scratch at the back of his head as he nervously laughs.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: A target to aim for...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.
(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)
