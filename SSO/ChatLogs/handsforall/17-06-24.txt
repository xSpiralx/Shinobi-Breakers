<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) snorts, looking away with her arms crossed, displaying her indifference to his response. <font color = white>&#34;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&#34;</font> she said, eyes shut tightly. Then, she peeks with a single eye, and retorts, <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s no surprise a beast only finds their own kind attractive.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) whips his head back over to the smart alecky girl who hadn&#39;t refused to shut up even now. It sounded like she was going to say something profound all the way up until the end, to which he glares and huffs, eyes now wide and still widening. <font color = white>&#34;Oh yeah!?&#34;</font>

Kaji does not mimic her pose, instead shoving a finger just under her chin. <font color = white>&#34;Well then behold,&#34;</font> His fingers press together and he snaps as if to get their attention. <font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s no beauty to be found here at all.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) furrowed her brows, her expression unable to mask her bottled fury.

It seems they were locked in a stalemate for the time being but with a few choiced words, perhaps he could turn this situation into one with an advantage? <font color = white>&#34;You, other kid. Seeing this, right? She&#39;s trying to muscle me into saying she&#39;s pretty. Why don&#39;t you tell her what you think of her?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

He looks the girl over.... He remembers what she said.. <font color = white>&#34;Uhhhhhh  Jalapeno Pepper.&#34;</font>

He then gives the  beige haird youth a head nod.</font></font></font>

I'm pretty, am I not?! You wouldn't let this hooligan harm such a cute, defenseless girl with their insults, would you?!”

During her outburst, she felt her grip loosen. The beige-haired youth's strength was naturally greater than her own, given their gender, and she was left wincing as the pain from her strained effort set in.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) says: E-Eeek...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) &#39;s cheeks puffed as she found herself overwhelmed by the boy&#39;s superior might, beginning to regret ever starting the altercation to begin with. And now, with nowhere to flee, and no one to call upon, she saw herself in a big dilemma. Her eyes shut tightly, praying for assistance, but alas, none would come. She could only rely on herself and her own ability.
 <font color = white>&#34;I said... Get off me!&#34;</font> she screamed.

In a fury of emotions, she aimed to wrench her arms away from his hold, using every ounce of strength within her. As desperation fueled her actions, she swung her head forward, intending to collide their foreheads. The impact, though painful, created just enough distance between them. She staggered back, her breath ragged, eyes burning with defiance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) would hear a loud bang.. Chonamu&#39;s heavy breathing would stop <font color = white>&#34;Hey ..You two stop goofing off something is happening.&#34;</font>

The cubby kid dashes off to go see what all the commition was about.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) finds an increasingly amusing feeling surfacing from within. The inexplainable sensation thriving when face to face with the girl having realized she bit off more than she could currently chew. It didn&#39;t make him feel strong, no, he always knew boys were just better than girls at things like fighting.

But maybe it was just seeing her eat her words? That was possibly the reason he felt so pleased with the current situation. Of course it doesn&#39;t stay that way as while the dark haired, onyx eyed girl is attempting to wrestle her hand free, he is unaware of her second method. 

He crumples under the pressure of a forehead. <font color = white>&#34;You---! Fat headed, wide forehead! Aaaugh, did you break my skull!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) 
On the contrary, Suzaku was desperately trying to overcome her fear of physical confrontation with a kid. To her fortune and surprise, their heads collided with a resounding thud, sending a sharp pain through her skull and knocking her off her feet and onto her backside.

She rubbed the point of impact, the pain a stark reminder to avoid such interactions unless absolutely necessary. Tears welled in the corners of her eyes, and with reddened cheeks puffed in indignation, she pointed an accusing finger at the beige-haired youth.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to touch me, you idiot!&#34;</font> she shouted, her voice trembling with anger. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m just a fragile little girl. It&#39;s not like I could hurt you, even if I tried!&#34;</font>

She sniffled, raising her hands to her eyes to catch the tears before they could fall and reveal her vulnerability. Then, she paused, her lips curving into a defiant smirk. Despite her display of weakness, she refused to concede defeat. <font color = white>&#34;Staying true to your kind, huh? Only a beast resorts to violence!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

With that said!

A simple skip backwards was all it took to clear the grab. Only to stomp right back into reach, aiming to tear the guy&#39;s Ribbon under his sandal&#39;s tread. Again!

But. Haste makes waste. He&#39;s not liking the sound of the Akimichi&#39;s latest utterance. It almost sounds as if they have a plan. And, well, he&#39;s already scored one hit upon them, even if it was by accident...

Hm. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got something fun planned too.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) snickered softly. <font color = white>&#34;Well I did think you could hold out for a little while longer, but I suppose I couldn&#39;t beat him on my own.&#34;</font> with this, the Uchiha took a breath before rushing forward to finally join the fray. Admittedly with her impressively slow speed it&#39;d take her a moment still before she would be able to get into the mix.

But given just how nimble Katora was, winning wasn&#39;t likely an option. She&#39;d take a moment to survey just how many ribbons Chonamu had. She&#39;d now be standing firmly face to face with each of them. But who would she target first?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (Totally forgot to keep round counter going on my markers lol)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) never underestimated an enemy. 
      Overestimation was key. Despite not showcasing such thus far, he suspected the Uchiha might be capable of clearing the distance to him in one stride, which would spell trouble if they saved such like a Trump Card. 

Therefore...
     As the latest heavy-weight hammer of a punch came for him? The Fuma Student dared to dash CLOSER! Yes, he darts into their guard, slanting out the way of that devastating STRAIGHT! It doesn&#39;t even clip him as he, quite literally, ran two steps up their torso. 

Chakra Adhesion of the Wall Walking technique made such tactics possible. He used them as a human springboard, pushing off his second step into a full moonsault, gone flying backwards. He landed on his feet and used the momentum to skip himself even farther. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve spent a good amount of time observing while we&#39;ve tired each other out... so I think I&#39;ve earned a breather.&#34;</font>

Honestly. That no-throwing weapon rule crippled him the most! But, he would not complain.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: So you'll have to talk to that blonde hair guy about it.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Well, my plan was to let Chonamu take a bit of damage while he wittled away at your defenses to a point where he and I could take you out in one shot. Then I'd be able to finish him off. But it was poor execution on my part.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I did have it planned out, though. You were just too crafty as well
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. We'll wait for my twin to give us the details.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) took a seat right there in the middle of the arena. 
No, he felt the mood strike to lay down completely.
A worn out sigh left him, while he stared at the clouds above. 

<font color = white>&#34;Good fight, you two. It was as mentally taxing as it was physically demanding.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: You have a twin?!

<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) asks: heh. You never know with these children old man. Did you need something?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yawns lazily as he joins the crowd of Iwagakure&#39;s kids. As he takes a comfortable seat, the old geezer would begin writing some notes as he planned his next trip to the next village.
<font color = white>&#34;Good morning kids.&#34;</font> he greets the group as he barely manges to recognize their blurry figures despite his aging eyesight <font color = white>&#34;Seems like most of you are still half asleep though..&#34;</font> he sighs as he notices the silence and occasional snoring <font color = white>&#34;I swear.. kids these days live too comfortably.. when I was your age I would be already awake organizing wares.. tsk-tsk!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) turned her gaze to the darker skinned old man to the other old man....A village of past and new.

<font color = white>&#34;Is that so?&#34;</font> She said slowly. She resisted the urge to say more about it.

<font color = white>&#34;In any case merchant. What deals do you have on blades? I have very little Ryo as a down payment&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (from xD sorry was in valorant.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) pockets away his notebook as he turns toward the young teen. Though he struggled in both sight and hearing, the old man would still make an effort to understand.. though failing miserably.

<font color = white>&#34;What deals.. on ladles?&#34;</font> he repeats, wondering how poor the kid must had been to not even have the ryo to buy kitchen wares <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t think this village lacked basic necessities like this.. I can probably get you a ladle for twenty ryo give or take.&#34;</font> he informs, quickly recalling the market price of those utensils.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) comes over and joins for a while, taking a seat.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) would cross her arms behind her back and and took afew paces closer as she gave her first offfer. 

<font color = white>&#34;I was thinking 50 ryo as a down payment. with 50% Interest on the final payment. Practically robbing me blind Oji-san.&#34;</font> she said stopping and see if the mask of being senile fell at that. 

Afterall....what merchant let age get in the way of profits?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yells: 5 ryo for a... ladle!? I just told you it's 20! I am too old for you to scam brat!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) clearly couldn't hear everything this time too</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) scoffed, he was driving a hard bargin. She was hoping to buy the expensive sake tonight. 

<font color = white>&#34;Very well....100 Ryo down. For a Sword, nothing named mind you. But sufficent to cut down rats or the poor.&#34;</font> even as her words had ended, she had drew closer to the man. Her firey gaze locked to him and not wandering mindlessly up at the clouds or at a book. 

<font color = white>&#34;This deal to get me armed will go down in writing of course. Papiyas Niwa always recalls those who help her.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) raises an eyebrow out of confusion..
<font color = white>&#34;Why are you giving me 100 ryo for a ladle!?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) squints, <font color = white>&#34; Hey baldie! What er you doing here?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was now before the old man. She was now clearly furious at this game. <font color = white>&#34;I said nothing about a ladle&#34;</font> she spat out before taking a deep breath. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am offering you all the ryo I have on me as a down payment for a Katana. This is the third and final time I shall repeat myself. Less I am the fool.&#34;</font> She reached out her gloved hand, tensed and clearly ready to slap something should the word ladle be brought up again

<font color = white>&#34;Do we have a deal?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Deal?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) finally hears what the woman had to say, though her attitude wasn&#39;t very appreciated.
<font color = white>&#34;Katana? Why didn&#39;t you say that earlier!?&#34;</font> he clicks his tongue <font color = white>&#34;Making me waste my time..&#34;</font> he mumbles to himself, only to inform the rude girl <font color = white>&#34;Lass, you won&#39;t find any blade from Akihabara for quite a while! The supply chain has slowed down and it will affect sales for the next couple of months! So forget katanas!&#34;</font>

He shakes his head, beside, women were better with a ladle in hand rather than a sword.. though he would keep that opinion to himself, he knew that recently some weird movement called womanism was gaining popularity..</font></font></font>

She spun then. <font color = white>&#34;Old dullards here to leer at women. I will be sure to let everyone I meet know to not buy from you or your equally bald friend.&#34;</font> she spat in the direction of the other one who had nothing to say but complaints.</font></font></font>
