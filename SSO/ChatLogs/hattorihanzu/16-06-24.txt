<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) closed her eyes, a vein buldged across her forehead -- though hidden by her bangs. Her irritation had reached its limit and although this boy didn&#39;t mean any harm she found his words to be truly demeaning. How dare he try bossing her around? That was her job.

<font color = white>&#34;You idiot!&#34;</font> she barked. With a clenched fist she sought to bonk the boy on the head. While she didn&#39;t really have any strength behind the punch, if it hit it&#39;d probably leave a lump on his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll never marry ya&#39;! Tha&#39; person I marry would know that -I&#39;m- tha&#39; prize damnit!&#34;</font> Reilin exclaimed.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) placed a hand on his hip and tilts his head to the side.
<font color = white>&#34;The job ta be ready whenever an enemy invades the village, woman.&#34;</font> he told her plainly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept up her scowl, unamused.

<font color = white>&#34;He doesn&#39;t even have a headband. He has no job.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She's got a point! Sh- Er, both of the girls talking right now I guess.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) pondered if she should kick him into the moat, just to get revenge from earlier, but figured it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea.

Well, it was, because she&#39;d come up with it, but it would come with a degree of future revenge, probably.

<font color = white>&#34;Have fun with that. M&#39;gonna go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: NO for real......Whos making those sandwhiches.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No one is big guy. No one is...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was completely off guard as he was continuing to take orders and was decked with a &#39;powerful punch&#39; that sent him flying.

<font color = white>&#34;--Gaaaaaaahhh!&#34;</font>

He slams on the floor while skidding slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hrngh..Ouch..Y-you&#39;re the prize??&#34;</font>

He grunts as he raises up to his feet, rubbing the afflicted area.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay okay..I think I get it..Ill buy you an apron before you get to making the sandwhiches...And a hair net!&#34;</font>

(Damage taken!)</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Don't worry..she's making the sandwhiches!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..Ouch..what a punch..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) moves over and stares the Uchihue into the eyes!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a great prize, mhm mhm.&#34;</font>

Hmmm, sammiches sound good though.

The spider girl would side step away again as she stares up at the sky.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: The wonders of youth...but arent you a bit to young to be asking girls to become housewives.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) had a strong suspicion they would try to push him into the moat too. Weird that they didn't.
<b>The Fūma would remember this.</b> Perhaps he would go easy on her the next time the opportunity to throw blunt objects at faces arose. 

Either way, he continued to sit there, with a water bottle in hand. Idly taking sips. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: YeJie.... Who is that large Tuediean with the red hair and stave?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Too young? My paw said to find a beautiful girl and to marry her!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I don't know, Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: So I'm doing just that!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Eh hmm..That reminds me, I wonder if she has any pepper corn ranch...
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: Hey wife! You got any pepper corn ranch for my sandwich??
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) suddenly begins to sweat a little bit. It's a very delayed response, but he can feel Shuye's looking in his general direction. His eyes wander in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Mmmmm peppercorn.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) points, this time more softly.

<font color = white>&#34;Mn... Ho...u as.....des...ions....th.....tong....in?&#34;</font> He murmurs for only her to translate.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) is looking past Venturo, to the tall man with the staff-- which makes his subtle sweat and anxiety even more funny.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) smirked to herself as she watched the children bicker. The mood was certainly boiling up to something edging on exciting.

<font color = white>&#34;Do not let that slight go unansweared young lady! I will owe you ten ryo should you make him eat such words.&#34;</font> She would march closer, a fire burning in her eyes to see more vicious bonks be delivered</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) yells: Yer' paw should have relayed it a bit better. Now all the girls are just going to think you are a creep. But uh..Good luck!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) glanced over.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey. The One who fell just before the Finish Line, considered quitting, but powered through with his pride intact. What&#39;s your name?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Six Arms, what's yer' name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her head toward Meixun then, giving Venturo a moment&#39;s repireve. She spoke, but the words didn&#39;t make any sense to anyone else at first, then.

<font color = white>&#34;You introduce yourself deferentially. Then you ask what his &#39;rank&#39; is-- He&#39;s old, so he&#39;s probably a chuunin. Unless he&#39;s talented, then he&#39;s probably a jounin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I am Tsuneko of the Tsuchigumo clan!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) felt satisfied after lashing out. Through she still held her fist up before lowering it just as Tsuneko made a remark. <font color = white>&#34;See? She gets it.&#34;</font> finally she slipped her hands into her pockets and looked toward the Troublemaker. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not makin&#39; any sandwiches! An&#39; I ain&#39;t marryin&#39; you!&#34;</font> she shook her head.

<font color = white>&#34;I might have&#39;ta knock more sense into ya&#39; if ya&#39; keep this up!&#34;</font> she stated. Though at the mention of peppercorn ranch she narrowed her gaze. Almost dumbfounded at this character. She could hardly believe it. But she did have an idea.

<font color = white>&#34;Listen.. If I&#39;m even gonna consider marryin&#39; you.. Ya&#39; gotta show me yer worth it.&#34;</font> she pinched her thumb and fingertips before rubbing them together, a universal signal for &#39;money&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (somber looking girl that profile ass
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) slowly steps side-ways along the edge of the arena. Moving closer to the masked rock-thrower while keeping his eyes on whatever thing is happening in across the moat. 

Leaning his head to the side, he says <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s Utsuwa Hideo. You&#39;re... something Katora, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) 's hands clasp together, his thumbs beginning to fidget. He's confident that he's the one being stared at...
... Then he feels her direction change. Something grabbed her attention, and thus was his time to make his great escape.. but he'd have to do it in a way that was subtle. One that wouldn't draw much attention. He could start running, he could leap across to the platform in the middle...

... Then it hit him.

He'd just... start walking away.
Very slowly.

Bit by bit...
Not once does he turn his head, to avoid making eye contact.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Xun? They have a rank of my name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) continues to rub his cheek and listens to the girl and notices that sign.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh..I think I get it..So to marry you I must get money! Do not worry, I will buy your love someday. Remember the name, Kaido! Iwagakure&#39;s most crafty ninja.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. Katora. Fūma Clan. 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Reilin do you like Kimono?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Nice to meet you
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Hey guys, we're going to have to put a hold on those sandwhiches for a while!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Nooooooooooo my sammich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a light laugh at the happenings across the moat. 
<font color = white>&#34;Ha... Kunoichi are scary.&#34;</font> A statement made with slow shakes of head. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Kinda cool. In a cute way.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: The Utsuwa family, huh? Can't say I've heard of them. What do they do?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched Venturo slowly depart, then snapped her eyes back to her brother, wondering which to answer first. Finally, she decided.

<font color = white>&#34;No, they don&#39;t. I&#39;d need to look in the textbook to get the exact definition. Just ask his name.&#34;</font> She said, before calling after Venturo.

<font color = white>&#34;Goodbye to you too then.&#34;</font> She sounded annoyed-- insulted, even.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Right, Kaido.. I'll make sure not ta' forget. I'm Uchiha, Reilin. Wish I could say it was nice ta' meet ya', Kaido but it ain't.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ehh, Kimono are nice.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh I don't know if my dad wants us to talk about that sort of thing or not.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why do ya' ask?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was merely gazing over the boys head, she did give a curious glance down at the fidgiting but alas....she was set to see the brewing lovers spat.

<font color = white>&#34;How calm it has become....I was hoping for something more entertaining to pass the time with.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: That's fair. Every family has their secrets.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I mostly meant the job-related stuff. Like, say, shopkeeping, blacksmithing, construction.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) grins at Rellin.

<font color = white>&#34;You won&#39;t be saying that when I become the richest in the village and a really successful shinobi..You&#39;ll be dying to marry me some day, Rellin Uchiha..So much, youll take my last name and drop the Uchiha from yours!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Hm? I dont care spread our name far and wide boyo! I do find it strange they havent heard of my last name. Moniker might be overshadowing it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) put a hand over her mouth at the mention of dropping her name. To onlookers she may have appeared shocked, but in reality she was stiffling her laughter.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh- We're all shinobi, I think. I 'unno what mom did before she passed. Or what our grandparents do, if anything. But dad's super cool and strong. And I wanna be too.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Right, I can't wait
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) has a pang hit him in the chest. Wait. Was he misreading the situation? He thought he was due for some sort of pummeling...but those words.. they couldn&#39;t have been for anyone else.

His contemplation is evident in the way he stops in his slow trek away. Not only did he fail in his mission, but he failed as a friend. As a teammate. As a lover of all things Earth.
To the child, these feelings all amalgamated into something he couldn&#39;t properly understand, but one thing he &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; know for certain was that it didn&#39;t feel good.

He turns back around, non-chalantly as if he wasn&#39;t in the middle of sneaking just now.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh? What&#39;s up?&#34;</font> he says, putting on an act. <font color = white>&#34;I thought I saw another neat pebble, but no.. not this time. I wasn&#39;t going anywhere! We&#39;re hanging out, after all! ... Right?&#34;</font> 

Accompanied with his act was probably one of the largest, most genuine smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) taps his chin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) nods firmly and shifts his body out of a stupor. Moving over to the Iron Vassal.

But. Each step he takes he gets slower... And... Slower. Something&#39;s off, the feeling&#39;s familiar--he&#39;s felt it infinitely back when he was younger, though as of right now? The feeling is... Jarring: it&#39;s warning him not to move forward, but that warning clashes with the nostalgia.
He bites his upper lip, steeling his resolve--whatever this unbecoming feeling was, it wouldn&#39;t dissuade him from getting used to the people here; and what better way to start than with someone of high statue?

<font color = white>&#34;....&#34;</font> He glares at the Vassal, eyes melding as per usual, attempting to dig something out of the man uncomfortably. Uncontrollably even, it&#39;ll most likely be something he&#39;ll never get over.

He speaks with the same, odious vile tone he&#39;s always spoken with.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was not the type to so easily forgive. Her arms crossed across her chest as they had time and time again, and would time and time again in the future. But the tuck&#39;s a little tighter, a little more standoffish. There&#39;s a shift in her weight onto the back foot, and a fierceness to her furrowed brow. Maybe it was the red eyes making it seem even more intense. He had been caught. He had been seen.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not sure I want to after that. Maybe I should give you back your pebble?&#34;</font>

She went straight for the gut punch.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Hello. Are you by any chance in relation to Iroha? The two characters you hold speak similar.

Oh yeah, he&#39;s shaken. Defeated, even.

He could understand the homework part. Shuye definitely seemed smart, and on top of that, she&#39;d have him sussed pretty correctly as a slacker. He often used &#39;charm&#39; to get his expectations lowered. It figures as well that she&#39;d be able to make her own lunch as well...

But what got him this time, was the logic behind the rock. She nailed him.
... Until...
<font color = white>&#34;To help kickstart your new collection of Venturo-branded rocks, of course!&#34;</font>

The shock seemed to be completely gone. He was smiling at her again, unphased. Seemed all you had to do was keep to the topic of these different &#39;collectibles&#39; to keep him engaged and excited.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mooonn, Shuye! You can&#39;t stay mad at me, pretty please? Extra please with your favorite topping on top? Do you even like toppings? Ice cream?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am not..even sure who you are talking about..&#34;</font>,he patted the boy on the head.

She merely admired the furnishings. <font color = white>&#34;This would make a fantastic start to a keep one day.&#34;</font> 

Her hands sat on her hips as she absorbed it all in to her content then sighed. 

<font color = white>&#34;Do you not think so?&#34;</font> She cooed out while turning to the person who was there all aong. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa's Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) was busy away, rifling through a number of things that the Kage had assigned him. He picked an empty house for the privacy, though upon seeing someone come in his mask is propped on before contact was made.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry er...&#34;</font> He glances around, the face mask helping to muffle his voice furthermore. <font color = white>&#34;It is quite spacious....I take it you’re looking for a home?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Iwa's Guard(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (brb
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) she waved a gloved hand dismissivly <font color = white>&#34;Not so, A Castle perhaps.&#34;</font> she let that sit in the air as she seemed to space out. 

<font color = white>&#34;But one day. And that day is not today, I merely tired of my peers....the childrens bickering. One was near in tears over a shiny rock&#34;</font> she gave a mocking laugh. 

<font color = white>&#34;I think I will be calling him Pebble hence forth.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa's Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) nods his head slowly in contemplation, <font color = white>&#34;ah yes, children can be quite...emotional. I’ve never had to deal with them myself much beyond duties. However, they are the future of what we have, and soon the heir to this village.&#34;</font>

He begins to make way for the door and holds it open for the other. <font color = white>&#34;You’re looking for something larger than this then&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) smiled as the conversation got on. It was the first real one she had in recent memory. <font color = white>&#34;Yes but buying one is so dull isnt it....&#34;</font> 

She commented and strode out ahead of them. <font color = white>&#34;I wish to take one by force one day. Something outside of the village perhaps. It could even stand as bulwark from attacks for the village.&#34;</font> she chatted idly on about far off ambitious dreams. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Papiyas, of the Niwa clan by the by. You arre?&#34;</font> She would ask looking at the distant scenery once more</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa's Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) begins to walk out after them, as he too was finished with the confines of the smaller house.

<font color = white>&#34;A shinobi who used to belong to Iwa, now under guidance of the Shogun. Thankfully, his grace, appointed me back home to care over the new generation.&#34;</font>

He looks back over to contemplate for a moment. <font color = white>&#34;I’m Masaki, though my family’s name no longer bear any weight to ears.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) listened, &#39;how wonderful&#39; she thought.... <font color = white>&#34;Quite the station you have risen up to, the shackles of ones clan can be a burden. I am sympthetic to such.&#34;</font> 

she would make a gesture to him to march on. <font color = white>&#34;I take it you are busy then Masaki so I wont rob you of the daylight. Ah~ yet would I be correct in assuming I should refer to you as sensei then?&#34;</font> she let out a almost sarcastic laugh, not to mock him no. It was to mock herself, a women of her age being a mere student in arms. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa's Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) couldn’t help but to crack a smile at that. <font color = white>&#34;Sensei? Eh....probably not. But whatever suits you. Masaki is just fine though&#34;</font>

He nods before counting on.<font color = white>&#34;I’ll be around though, should you find any help needed. Please to meet you, Papiyas&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) reached out her gloved hand in an offer of a handshake. <font color = white>&#34;I am eager to learn Masaki, may your ambitions not end here.&#34;</font> 

She would take a step away after. <font color = white>&#34;May all our ambitions blossom skyward to overtake the sky.&#34;</font> she said nearly to herself squinting up at the smoldering sun, as if challengeing it to burn out her vision. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am off to finish my exploreing then.&#34;</font> she said bursting into a stride and breaking off her one sided staring contest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa's Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) trails after the red-headed with a smile behind the mask. In a brighter tone, with clear indication of eagerness, he responds.

<font color = white>&#34;Catch! Please!&#34;</font> She shouted to the aloof aspirant as she tossed her barely-eaten Matcha-flavored ice cream in a waffle cone in his direction with a small boy practically climbing on top of her and pinching Venturo between them. Wikth her ice cream now out of her hands, she&#39;s left with no choice.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) hasn't ever seen something like that before in his life. Who let this kid get so nimble to begin with? Even worse how they were approximately the same size... where was your gusto, Venturo? Much like a tool, he is used as a buffer, and soon, it seemed he'd be sent on a ride into some watery depths. It's at some point in this whole exchange that he just accepts his fate for what it is, looking beyond the 'fourth wall' (AKA, at the three on the platform across from them) with a face that clearly asks where it all went wrong.

Into the pool, they go!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) noticed that his brother wasn&#39;t looking and moved in a race against time to grab the waffle cone.
  Taking a small bite of the food for him as a tax for saving the snack.
   <font color = white>&#34;Just making sure it&#39;s not poison.&#34;</font> Yurei said, before passing it to it&#39;s intended recipient.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) hands reach out and the cone taps against his palms. What most would&#39;ve though would be a dramatic explosion of ice cream, instead, is just the thud of the desert&#39;s edible container which plummets toward the earth inveitably breaking upon contact.

   - Or atleast that what would&#39;ve happened. 
Instead, Yurei swoops in to save the day and he slowly opens his eyes.
     <font color = white>&#34;...Thanks.&#34;</font>, he mutters with a sigh. His line of sight shifting toward the water bound group.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) attempted to scale across his sister like she were a tree, though it seems his endeavors were dutifly halted by Venturo&#39;s tool demeanor. The cretin stretched an arm amateurishly out to the slit-eyed youth, clawing at the male in an attempt to reach some form of sweetness... Only for him to be retched away by a moving Shuye!

Moments pass before Meixun renders himself conscious once again, soaked, and on top of his sister, who was in turn on top of the two-toned boy. He scratches his hair slightly, wondering why exactly he&#39;s in a body of water when he can&#39;t swim.
<font color = white>&#34;YeJii...&#34;</font> He poked his sister slightly, legs tightening up in anxiety on not knowing how deep the pool exactly was..

His voice grew harsher, though more out of worry than indignance.
<font color = white>&#34;YeJiiiiii...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) managed to get up and out of the water, where she could pry her little brother off of her now soaked form and deliver a harsh, but fair elbow to his head. <font color = white>&#34;Idiot! You know you can&#39;t have any! Stick to rice candy.&#34;</font> She chastised him, before wringing out her kimono a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Zhu, Shuye. Not Candy Brain.&#34;</font> She announced to the taller Mugen, before turning toward the boy who held her icecream. She can see some is missing, but for all she knew that happened in flight. She moved closer, a hand offered.

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for catching that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;Mugen, Raku.&#34;</font>, he then looks to his brother. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s talking about him.&#34;</font> He looks toward both the razor-lashed boy and Venturo&#39;s direction.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks down to her hand and then mindfully resists the urge to take another bite of the icecream.
  <font color = white>&#34;Are you wanting to give me more ice cream?&#34;</font> The treat is slowly risen to his face to take a lick, if even allowed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had no desire to actually eat rocks. However, money was now on the line... He raises a hand towards the not-related red-head and calls out,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept her soaked hand outstretched.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a jolt of pain ripple through his skull, though he was too comfortable piggybacking on his sister to recognize the pain. She was also speaking so forcefully, I guess she&#39;s upset at him worrying about the watersi--

Wait, rice candy?! Oh.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh........Sorry.&#34;</font> He muffled into her back before raising his head to meet her still placed elbow. The pain... Oh wait she hit him.

<font color = white>&#34;Owh....&#34;</font> His delayed reaction caused him to roll off of her back and onto the ground below.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) would quickly take a knee by the water and feel about for a pebble....she was merciful and did pick one that was well worn down. Perhaps it would crack under pressure?

With a sigh he turns back the woman and nods. Reaching out and taking the pebble from her. Staring down at it in his hand for a quiet second before tilting his hand back. The hand comes up and tosses the rock into his mouth.

A loud clacking can be heard as he repeatedly tries to bite it. After a final defiant bite, he spits it back into his hand.

<font color = white>&#34;Pthoo, nope, not possible. Worth a shot though.&#34;</font>

His free hand reaches out toward her. Beckoning her to give him his well earned ryo...</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) took her cone. There&#39;s a slight nod of approval that he didn&#39;t pilfer further from the gift she had received earlier. And all things considered, it was still not as melty as the icecream Venturo had brought for himself and ruined. She&#39;d first go for another bite of the ice cream, her teeth flashing as she chewed the coldest bits and fought off brain freeze.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s green, though.&#34;</font> She replied, playing coy while watching the pair of ice-cream safeguarding brothers with her vermillion colored eyes. She &#39;accidentally&#39; stepped on her own brother&#39;s shoulder with her sandals, too, since he was still on the ground behind her.</font></font></font>

The women reached into her lavish clothing and....produced ink and paper. She quickly writ out a letter of debt naming herself (Papiyas of clan Niwa) required to retun the sum of five ryo to the almost stone crusher of Iwa. 

It was an IOU. She passed over the paper as if it was natural. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stares down at the IOU blankly for a long time. He was not a smart boy. Tucking the pebble into his pocket; he takes the paper in both hands and holds it up to his eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;This... doesn&#39;t look like ryo...&#34;</font>

The paper is slowly lowered. Allowing Hideo to glare at the woman from behind the IOU.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks towards the young man being pressed on behind Shuye with a small tilt of his head. His luck had ran dry long ago by appearances.

  <font color = white>&#34;Not what I was talking about.&#34;</font> He clarified quickly without thinking. He was instead reliving a moment in the past, pondering on how it would have felt to instead eat the entirety of the treat she had lost.

  He wasn&#39;t going to spend what little he had on ice cream.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: You're stepping on him.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) the women&#39;s gaze blazed a moment. There are downsides to dealing with commoners. <font color = white>&#34;That is a letter of debt. Surely your parents have taken on debt before yes?&#34;</font> 

She held her tongue a moment....<font color = white>&#34;That is to say only a fool carries wealth on their person. A sure way to get robbed dont you think?&#34;</font> She pointed a digit at the paper. 

<font color = white>&#34;That paper will legally bind me to pay you.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh.&#34;</font> 

She moved her foot then, and looked down at her brother. <font color = white>&#34;Why are you still on the floor? I didn&#39;t hit you that hard.&#34;</font> She mumbled, before turning her attention on the boys, and deciding upon a nonsequitor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Shuye.&#34;</font> They&#39;d probably heard. <font color = white>&#34;But I missed who you guys are, other than something about -- mugen?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) got up without a second word, she must be satisfied now--right? Yeah, right.
He wrings out the girl's sleeves while she converses, just to soften any hard feelings left behind of course.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) looks between the paper, and over his shoulder toward his father. Despite the boys passion for getting money his family was actually really well off. But he had no idea if they had ever messed with debts at all.

Finally looking back to the woman he sighs. Stuffing the IOU into his pocket as he mumbles,

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re good for it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Hello Shuye.

  <font color = white>&#34;Mugen, Yurei. A-and my brother. He&#39;s here too.&#34;</font> The juxtaposition of him and his sibling felt congruent in energy, yet their looks differed slightly. . .
As if only having one same parent.</font></font></font>

She went to go and sit at the water&#39;s edge, tucking a single leg under her and letting the other dangle off the edge as she placed her chin in her palm and sighed. 

<font color = white>&#34;Still a match of wrestling would soothe this boredom I am sure. Has anyone seen the sumo battle before? What a sight.&#34;</font> She day dreamed aloud.</font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;Mugen, Raku.&#34;</font>, he calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: It is not about being good at it. But the mere act of trying that sets us mortals apart. As you have shown already, daring a feat the rest of us feared.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) let her brother wring out the lingering water in the fabric. She was hiding it pretty well, but it was cold out here in wet clothes. She started to shiver and took another bite of her ice cream, nearly done with it now as it was mostly a waffle cone with a little bit of matcha instead of the other way around now. She reached a hand over to her brother and gently palmed his head reassuringly. Compared to her and Meixun, they didn&#39;t look as similar as they ought to. She turned her head toward the six armed albino girl and tucked her chin slightly, acknowledging her greeting and returning it non verbally.

Shuye didn&#39;t piece it together, though.

She&#39;s not particularly fast, or agile, or strong, or durable-- but what she can do is use jutsu very well! Handseals are weaved, until the girl transformed into a spitting image of the slit-eyed youth as she slowlyl manuevered towards the tree. That way if it charged her, it&#39;d gore the wood, and not a person.

<font color = white>&#34;How do you even calm a bull down?&#34;</font> Yurei would hear his own voice asking him.

  <font color = white>&#34;Oh, no.&#34;</font> He knew there was no reasoning, instinctively he knew there was no use talking down this animal. It was dangerous.

  <font color = white>&#34;Anyone been hurt?&#34;</font> He found himself wanting to ask that. Instead he just repeats,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) assessed the scene from up above. Quietly murmuring to himself while he stood on his branch.

<font color = white>&#34; <i>Hm. An escaped bull. Or is that a cow-- eh... unimportant. It probably belongs to a farm nearby. They would probably be upset if we were to harm it, but we can&#39;t let it gore anyone, so... hmm... capturing a bull. Don&#39;t have any rope on me... </i>&#34;</font>

During his contemplations, he used those sharp eyes of his to search the creature for any labels, either seared on by Brand, or hanging off it by tag, that might suggest who the cow belonged to. 

[Using Eagle Eyes, got any notable tags/brands that might suggest ownership?]</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: This is so strange.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) eyes the bull before rubbing her chin a little...

<font color = white>&#34;Huh.  I wonder...  Reilin...  I want steak or hamburger dinner...&#34;</font>

She states eyeing the bull...  It could be so tasty if butchered and cooked properly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a rise of bloodlust in the bull's eyes, it was on a rampage; following silently behind his sibling and fellow youth, Meixun arrives to seeing his sister transform right in front of him!

Oh, that's what he's fell behind on knowing--the basics. Well, no matter, there's some things you just have to have a knack for before you can begin. What he can do in the meantime... Is dig.

He positions himself directly behind Shuye's disguised form, and... Sits down, legs and arms crossed he sits on the grassy terrain. His eyes lid to a shut, forcing himself the embue the surrounding motions for a time. Even if there isn't any spike in chakra on the animal, he could atleast anticipate the severity of the being's strike.

That is, if he's able to annouce it in a timely manner for those targeted to react.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks at his bull, then, his brother.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) As several people being to act, the instinctual beast does what he must do. He sees everyone around him as a threat to his position as the head breeding bull back at Ram Ranch.

With that he explodes forth towards the slit eye'd kid with incredible speed, not even noticing the replica formed by the girl alongside him. His intention was to ram his head directly into the kid's mid-section, but at the last moment he saw the copy that had been made and pulled up. This resulted in him simply plowing through the kid and luckily not trampling him.

The bull then examines the area for his next target.

(Light injury to Yurei, having bull roll for next target.)

The Fūma said as much from their Sniper&#39;s Nest, loud enough for the crowd of his peers to hear. Even over the loud cries from the aggravated animal. 

<font color = white>&#34;Anyone got rope? Or... something to lure it with? Bulls are attracted to the color red, says my folk-knowledge, but that might be a myth.&#34;</font> Once he offered his Intel and suggestions, while the violent creature began to rampage on the distant children, he left the rest to them.

Speaking of, she produced a book from the pouch on her flank, and flipped it to a page with a bookmark.

<font color = white>&#34;Ain&#39; like we&#39;re soldiers yet, anyway.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yet, soon we might be though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Not yet no
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Well if I get placed on a team with either of you. I'll try to help cover you with my doton
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll bonk people with my swords, when I get them.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Mm. Probably won' be leavin' the village on missions fer a long time. Oughta look into a different squadmate than me.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wouldn't mind having either of you as squadmates.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Gettin' 'long don' mean much if yer squaddie ain' good fer fightin', 'n ah'm tellin' ye, ah probably won' be fer a hot minute.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: This shit's so complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Neither will I, I dunno how to use a sword much less two. Meanwhile people are gonna throw fireballs and shit.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Elemental jutsu is foundational to combat.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah. Imma not use it though.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Won' have the time t'learn any.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Why is that?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wanna focus on swords instead. No time to learn much else.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) squinted.

<font color = white>&#34;Does it take that much dedication?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Can' juggle medical bullshit 'n elemtal bullshit'n the same time, 'cause reasons.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) nodded.

<font color = white>&#34;Maybe if only I used one sword, but if I wanna use two? Probably.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (Elemental*)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i thought it was on purpose bc of her accent lol)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (That's the true superpower of writing an accent. People can never tell.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned. So many people were medically inclined, it was almost shocking. At least there would be no lack of colleagues...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: How're things you all?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: 'Kay I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Fine.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Hi.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Think Raku's still asleep.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Is anyone training today?
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Nay right now, clearly.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'm more a book reader than a trainer.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Books are a good way of training the mind.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Likewise.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) was in fact, reading right in this moment, holding a book in one hand, and scribbling notes on a little pad with the other. All while sitting dangerously on the edge of the moat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I'm done with my meat-cutting for the day, I was hopin' to get into somethin' less dull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) walked up behind the white-haired person, peeping in to see what they were reading without invading their personal space.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Are you the son of a butcher?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn&#39;t appear to care much for the approaching youth, and simply continued to study. It quickly became apparent she was was reading about everyone&#39;s favourite topic of treatment methods for various kinds of fungal infections. In this particular instance, stomach infections, and all the not-so-pleasant symptoms, and how to quell them.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Fraid ah ain&#39; known t&#39;be much fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) shook his head, medical studies were an interesting topic. He began to see different roots praised for their antifungal properties and ailments which could be caused by an infectious encounter with them.
 Truth be told, he had no real idea what he was looking at, but caught the gist.

   Turning around to face north he speaks out while sitting on the ground.
<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s like a general goods man, has his hands in different things. Some of the meat will go to our home, some will be sold.&#34;</font> Yurei describes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn't look particularly happy with the topic, but what could she do. Hunkering down, and learning it was a simple requirement if she wanted to excel, even if studying definitely wasn't a fun occasion for her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crossed her arms. She thought about whether to keep asking him things about it, but instead shared about herself--

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m a vegetarian.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: So what you eat plants?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Well, not just plants. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...Actually, yes, just plants. I guess fruit are technically from plants. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) wrinkled her nose as the dust storm rolled on in, and called it a day for studying.

<font color = white>&#34;...Oughta get a pair o&#39; goggles.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: .... so dujsty.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: I get it, does it get boring?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Ugh, my eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Not to me! You can use a lot of different toppings.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked distant--

<font color = white>&#34;You don&#39;t want to know what too much meat does to you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shields himself from the raging dust and begins to make his way off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns, equipped with a straw hat on his head and another in hand. In a swift motion he'd look to offer the other to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes the hat and then places it on top of his head to wall the dust from his face.
  <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, Raku, what a surprise.&#34;</font> He stated with a smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods and parts his lips to speak once more.
  <font color = white>&#34;I spoke to a higher-up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Did they give you orders to get us hats?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: They said we may have the power to surpass the Shogun.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: The Mugen clan is that strong?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm not sure..
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Are we a clan?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Kind of, but kind of not.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: To be able to surpass the Shogun, you'd have to be stronger than strong.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Why would you even want to do that? 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: i kinda like the idea of peace area to meet other people in the future.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Not real sure.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I feel like the Shogun is one-hundred years old.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I was told that even he can bleed.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: And just as energy recycles, so does power.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I don't think I want power, Yurei.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) nuzzled his mouth lower into the collar of his hoodie as the dust storm raged across the village. Just another day in Iwagakure.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Mmh...
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: M'gonna be back'n a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Don't really get it myself. Maybe they were talkin' about the village, or themselves.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) kneaded some chakra in his mouth before opening his lips and depositing a golden coin-shaped object. He began flicking it between all thirty fingers.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) yells: It's still storming!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) returned! Now wearing a pair of goggles so she wouldn't have to squint.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It storms quite a bit...it's really annoying. I can't see shit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) shot a quick glance at his peers talking before shrugging and returning to his coin.

<font color = white>&#34;We have to be comfortable in it. If we&#39;re used to it, our enemies will have quite a hard time attacking us here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What if they wear goggles?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Doubt they could even make it through the front door.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Thank god it's over...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hello, hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) head flicks upward as the sandstorm subsides. <font color = white>&#34;Mm..&#34;</font>, he hums to himself as he&#39;d became lost in thought. Eventually, he&#39;d tuck away the straw hat in his void like confines and began to make his way off.

   <font color = white>&#34;Library.&#34;</font>, is all he says to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How's it goin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) uses a line of twine to rope the straw hat to his backside before heading west after a while.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sup, nothing really going on.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Oh hello Reilin
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just staring at this arena, and the water.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Sounds like a buzzkill to be honest.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nothing else to do until we get a class honestly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (everytime the game lags before i post i have the fear i mischannel'd or some shit)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (after i post*)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Class?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: What do ya' need class for?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Taijutsu, shurikenjutsu and eventually kenjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ooh.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmm, I myself will be using Katon, shurikenjutsu and well I haven't thought of anything else just yet
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Shurikenjutsu sounds like a great place to start.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I just wants swords, man.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Using kenjutsu would be a lot of fun but I can't really spread myself too thin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, fair enough. I dunno how much I'll use ranged weapons anyways. I prefer to get close to my enemies.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Well that's good to know, if we ever go on any missions together that is.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Damn kdis
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Eh?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Who're you, Gramps?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) squints, <font color = white>&#34;Who said that? Wher&#39; ar&#39; ya&#39;?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) turned around towards the merchant and raised her hand.

<font color = white>&#34;Me, who&#39;re you gramps?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: He looks old
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Probably doesn't have much going for em
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) looks over at the red afro girl, <font color = white>&#34;Old? Look here young man! Mind your elders!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You're right, they really do look like a boy...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) sniffs the air, <font color = white>&#34; The smell of Dog piss...I&#39;m still i Iwa then? I thought I left..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sup.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: ...Dog piss?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: The Inuzuka clan doesn't seem to have any one in our age group. But. They do have dogs.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Don't ya smell that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, must be nose blind.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: *Hmph* Must be se to smelln' it then
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Sticks her tongue out at the old man. The girl had blinked a few times.. before offically responding towards him. <font color = white>&#34;Mind my elders? I don&#39;t even know you, and you should get your eyes checked old timer. I am not a man or a guy, I am frankly surpised someone as old as you is still alive..&#34;</font> She groaned, before turning her attention to her brother. The girl moved over towards his side. <font color = white>&#34;Hey nii-san.&#34;</font> She said standing before him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Wha'cha doin' here, Gramps?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: He's probably here to visit a tailor.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches with amusement as his younger sister roasts the strange old man. As she approaches, he reaches out and moves to lightly karate chop her. Tapping her head with his hand as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Himeki. Who&#39;s the old guy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) mumbles, <font color = white>&#34;Damn snot nosed brats,&#34;</font> to himself before closing his eyes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times as she shifted her attention towards him. She had gently grabbed his hand.

<font color = white>&#34;What ya doing? And I have no idea, he seems rude.&#34;</font> She had said before saying.

<font color = white>&#34;Another game of 200?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (And buying my first core)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Haha, this old guy is pretty funny.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Rest well, Gramps.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm, if you need anything mister let us know.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm not doing anything yet. Pretty quiet morning so far. Did dad give you more money to bet with? Cause I was serious yesterday! Tired of playing two-hundred and betting with cool rocks...
<br><font color=green>*Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) arrives.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: No
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hey, Kaido. How're you doin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) flicked the sticky coin he had produced across his fingers once more, taking in the situation quietly with a wandering violet gaze. A dark eyebrow would be raised at the grumpy old merchant.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) nods at Rellin and lets out a huge sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhh I&#39;m doing pretty good you know. Getting better, going to be the greatest in my specialization one day heh. How are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) begins counting his ryo over, becoming increasingly proud of his earnings.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) finally removes his hand from atop her head and stuffs it into his pocket. Sighing as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Then we&#39;re not gonna play two-hundred. Rolling dice just to roll dice isn&#39;t fun...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: yI need to make some money, who's got some?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: *I*
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll give you 100 ryo if you give me 200 ryo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) eyes panned between the collective. Silently observing his soon to be peers as the intereact with one another and form indepenent fractions. At this moment all he required was some form of indication of who was in charge. He wasn't sure if the village had an active chuunin nor Jounin.

But it was probably wise to keep a close eye on every's attire. Maybe there he'd be able to parse out the officials from the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances at the light purple haired girl.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not even pretty enough to talk to, go make me a sandwhich.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirled her hair around her index finger idly while she conversed. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. I think I&#39;ll be the best in mine as well. Make sure you don&#39;t fall behind.&#34;</font> she said with a light chuckle.

<font color = white>&#34;Care to share what your specialization will be, or are you one of the people who like to keep secrets?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll keep it a secret for now!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) wonders for a time where his brother could be, though he eventually yields his mind to focus on himself.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) witnessed a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.

(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) approaches the crate first, slinging a Vectro Belt over his shoulder and scurrying off. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the rules of engagement from the light-haired senior who hosted this streamer game. It was unusual, something he wasn&#39;t used to, but truthfully it did sound a little fun. It was a raw test of agility and not much else.

  <font color = white>&#34;Seems like it&#39;ll be based mostly on chance if you make it to the end. I&#39;m game for a little flag tag.&#34;</font> He leans off the wall.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So what are streamers?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) hummed softly, not too sure how to come out of this successfully. She doubted she'd win but figured it'd be a good way to pass the time so she moved toward the crate and grabbed herself a velcro belt with one streamer each, strapping both to her hips.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) picks his nose without a care in the world, before tossing the booger to the side. Luckily, confucianism made it impossible for younger people to criticize the elderly.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohohoh.. Iwagakure sure loves its violence.&#34;</font> he comments as he takes a seat, fully intending to watch the brawl unfold</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: What are streamers? The red and blue fabric attached to your velcro belts.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) begins to roll his shoulders and grins at Katora. Knowing that the masked boy couldn&#39;t use his eagle eye to snipe flags off of belts. With his arms rudimentarily stretched he steps forward! Grabbing a belt and affixing the little streamers to the velcro spots on the belt.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright! I&#39;m gonna win- Wait how do we win this game? Do we collect a bunch of flags?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So ya lose both, you lose?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) barked out a laugh <font color = white>&#34;A fun game I suppose if not simple, if only I had some sake to sip as I watched.&#34;</font> She said notig the blonde had not replied to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;A more fitting name would be Royale Rumble.&#34;</font> She said as she stalked closer to the crate to reach in and secure her belt across her waist.
<font color = white>&#34;Let us dance then!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Percisely!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Who do I room with?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Or are we decidin' our opponents?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked to the set of velcro belts and put one of them on, adjusting it so it&#39;d feel comfortable for her. It would probablyy be a bit chaotic right from the get go so she did the smart thing of gettting a bit further away the moment she could to not get instantly defeated by everyone at once.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font> she breathed in, slowly inhaling and exhaling. <font color = white>&#34;Who wants to go?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: W-Wait no seriously how do we win?! We just lose if we get both flags taken but like- Do we win if we get more belts than someone else?
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Last person standing wins!
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Duh..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh, cool

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) scratched the thinking side of his skull and then walked forward towards the dark trove to claim a Ninja Velcro Belt.

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Let go of me.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It sounds like... the kind of game where getting jumped is very likely.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Perfect!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) squinted a little.  Another game to play, honestly she was currently not a fan of these kinds of games...    Or well, games in general after the one earlier thus she was currently trying to decide to she should take part in this or not.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm...  Choices.&#34;</font>

She whispered to herself softly.  Though she would find herself having a question.

<font color = white>&#34;Um.  If we capture other peoples flags.  Do they count towards our life or just shows we eliminated people?&#34;</font>

This was important.  If it counted towards one&#39;s life, then those who were agile would win.  If it didn&#39;t then those who formed groups and ganged up on others would win...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Hideo!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He-- motherfucker.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Would began to strap her two streamers on her belt, the girl had questioned if she was gonna be able to possibly. Her attention would focus on several thingsf, she wasn&#39;t quite sure what she would do for team mates.. she seemed like she would be alone.. without warning she would run off as well.. 

<font color = white>&#34;Seeing as this free for all.. I am go hide..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: They do not, hurting a enemy in battle doesn't magically restore your wounds silly.
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Protect your streamers at all costs.
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Now grab your belts and get out there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) entered the academy, his jaw tightening slightly. He felt uneasy about being late to the festivities.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) entered the building a little late, be as it may, it doesn't seem like there'd be much need to be present right then and there. The trickster's repetitve instruction echoed throughout the halls, surrounded by the voice of his comradery--essentially, it seemed to be a battle royale of sorts.

A crabby voice caught his attention, recognizing that as his sister-- waved and pointed toward the collection of connecitve belts assigned. Seeing as everyone was taking one, he assumed it was only right for him to grab onto one as well. He bowed to the trickster, took himself a belt, made his way further into the building--shooting a leer at the new Kunoichi in between Cho'Kuome and Mugen. No time to recognize her signature at the moment...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) began to walk forward with belt in hand. If his brother was here, having them to partner up with would be the most ideal strategy. Though with his absence, he would have to find another way to prosper.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) went ahead and secured himself a set of streamers and the harness they hung from.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) slicked his hair back, in a tired, slow, lazy slide of hand.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Besides. My violence of choice is throwing things. A swordswoman in training will probably best me up close.

With that she would dash closer to him. No finesse or strategy, a bold bull charge forwards

TM 3.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) tilts his head. A brief pondering. 
<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re old enough to drink?&#34;</font> 

A casual question as he fell into a light sprint to meet them. He&#39;s got his palms raised in a mid-guard riddled with openings. But. Perfect for darting out a speedy jab of a chop for one of his opponent&#39;s ribbons. 

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s test those reflexes.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;You are not?&#34;</font> she raised a brow, he looked older than most of their peers. 

<font color = white>&#34;A funny notion, old enough to kill but not old enough to drink.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;True. Funny that.&#34;</font>

A swipe of the Red Head&#39;s paw for his ribbon prompts him to skip a half step and pivot. The Spin from such being just enough to wind the strip of streamer close to his body like thread to a spool. 

<font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean anything by it, mind you,&#34;</font> he says, before skipping back into reach and slicing a chop yet again. Intent on slicing the edge of his hand through her ribbon.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m in the same boat. A bit old.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) a dark look would cross her vision as she did not recover her stance quick enough and the streamer soon fluttered to the ground....

<font color = white>&#34;Well done.....One to go.&#34;</font> she snarked before raising a leg to kick at the streamer in hopes of shocking them. <font color = white>&#34;I am aware, all the same you are missing out if you have not enjoyed sake.&#34;</font> she chatted through gritted teeth

<font color = white>&#34;Is that so? I&#39;ve never tried sake, or any drinks for that matter...&#34;</font>

A kick came axing in mere milliseconds after their ribbon hit the floor. Without losing a beat. He&#39;s sharp enough to raise a leg himself, absorbing the kick with his shin, to protect his precious ribbon dancing just beyond it. 

He stamps his fending leg down and skips the other one up, effectively trying to Bicycle Kick their last remaining ribbon in retaliation. 

<font color = white>&#34;...is it fun? Sake. Drinks. My Father warns against them. Dulls the senses.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Sake is light, tasty I would say. I would avoid that foul harsher stuff myself. That is what may floor you&#34;</font> she advised as she more so reached than attacked in a final bid to score at least a single ribbion in the back and forth.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) clicked tongue against teeth when she managed to dance around his kick. Though he&#39;s smiling under the mask. One could see it in his eyes. 

<font color = white>&#34;Your footwork isn&#39;t bad either. I can tell you know what you&#39;re doing.&#34;</font>
But. They were simply lacking in practice, just like he and everyone else. He&#39;s certain that would change with time.

<font color = white>&#34;Light and tasty?&#34;</font> A hand snatched for his ribbon, though he made like a Karate Kid and Wax Off&#39;d. Almost like a window washer&#39;s lateral wipe, he chops the edge of his hand into their wrist to divert the trajectory of their grab, leaving those fingers to take hold of nothing but air.

In kind, he steps into their guard and snatched for that dancing streamer of theirs, while she&#39;s yet to lean away from her assault. 

<font color = white>&#34;Here I thought all alcohol was supposed to taste bitter. I prefer sweet things. I wouldn&#39;t mind trying some, if you know of some like that.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Well this has been fun Katora, your skill is impressive and I wish you luck in the  bouts to come.&#34;</font> she praised and distenced herself. 

<font color = white>&#34;But no not all, most of it is made to be enjoyed so I am sure we can find you a sweet one.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) held their ribbon in hand. Torn as the one he primarily chopped through. A moment&#39;s taken to secure that one from the ground as well. And then? He tied them to his belt. 

After which, he bids them a respectful yet slight bow of head.
<font color = white>&#34;Impressive? Please. I&#39;m still learning. We&#39;ve both got a long way to go, but I look forward to where we&#39;ll end up. But thank you nonetheless.&#34;</font>

She was of refined attitude, he determined, which was a pretty fair measure of one&#39;s future value. So says his outlook. Only the foolish and vain would make a big deal out of something like this little class. 

<font color = white>&#34;I look forward to the drink too. Just don&#39;t poison me or something. My Father would piss on my grave if he found out I didn&#39;t listen to his warnings about Kunoichi tactics.&#34;</font>
