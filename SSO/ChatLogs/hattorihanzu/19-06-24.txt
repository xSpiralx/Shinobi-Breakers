<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I've chosen to avoid women until I'm a jounin.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well- not avoid. But not worry about.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Shooting for Jounin? Ambitious. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Why wouldn't I? Tsuchikage would mean I gotta dethrone grandma.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: So Jounin's as high as I can get!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Considerate. Speaking of ranking up? We'll be graduating soon.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Are you ready for all that Genin work?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Yeah we will. Yeah I am. You?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well-
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yep.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Mm.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'm only missing two things.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Which would be?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A decent pair of squad members who use skills that work well with my own.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: T-That may be more important you already think...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Apparently part of the graduation is going off to fight rogues or something...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yeah? Sounds challenging.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Getting some insider details from your Dad, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: He mentioned it during the uh... class.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ahh. I might've missed that bit.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It was uh, hard to pay attention to yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: For sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Lot of moving parts...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like that dudes fuckin' head- Yeah I'm not sleeping tonight.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a solemn few nods to that.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Sooooo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Back to squads and stuff. What're you good at Katora? Besides throwing stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I plan to learn some Ninjutsu. Raiton, probably.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Throwing and raiton huh? Good combo, I think.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: How about you? Have you done the chakra-paper-test in class yet?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Ha, did it a long time ago!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: What'd you get?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Doton and Katon, just like dad and Himeki.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I might study some taijutsu later too. Not sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Or throwing stuff. All good choices...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Mm. Never a bad idea to dabble. 
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Niwa, Papiyas has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Sounds like you kids have it all figured out. A solid duo
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Maybe. How about you, Papiyas? Given your future any thought?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: I know you have your Kenjutsu... but will you branch out?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm not sure I'd call us a duo though.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I second that. Finding suitable squadmates demands a bit more thought.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Not that I don't like you Katora- You're cool. Weird, but cool. But yeah it takes a lot more thought than us just being the two guys who have an idea.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Gotta interrogate our classmates and really give it a think.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You'll be trusting one another with your lives, after all. There's a lot to consider.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Exactly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (sorry gaming)
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I will be a sword saint. I will make the budda blush with each swing of my blades
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Anything else....uneeded.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Dedicated to your craft. I can respect that.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (costs me 89 points to go my build. Thats without OED. Cores and mostly 2 handed is full build.)
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: ....Where am I?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Iwa again.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Thought you could smell us old man
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Man, I've never been up this late. Is it always this quiet?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: More or less. But there tends to be a high point
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Oh yeah? When's it gonna be you think?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: At any point....but its truely up in the air. My life has moved so fast it nearly feels like it could all be condensed down into afew days.....or perhaps I am rambling hahaha
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-No, no, I know what you mean.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Could always peek at the gates or up where the business from earlier took place. Surely some Shinobi are lingering about
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: The gate, maybe. But... I really don't wanna see the stage again for a few days.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) nods her head. She could understand the feeling. <font color = white>&#34;They say all return to heaven. Even the bad are recycled. So not something to fret about.&#34;</font> 
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean the guys soul isn't what I'm concerned about...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Oh? Hmm....I cannot say I understand your worries then.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Y-You don't have a problem with watchin' a guy get his head bashed in, and then sent flying? And a your classmates covered in his blood?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) hummed again. She stroked her chin as she gave the boys words some consideration. She had hardly dwelled on the events, afterall she knew what she signed up for. 

<font color = white>&#34;No I cannot say it is that suprising. I have seen death tho not so.....graphic.&#34;</font> her voice trailed in a moment of thought. 

<font color = white>&#34;I signed up to be a Shinobi, once in history it was the custom to sever your kills heads to prove you had done your job. All is mandated by heaven, ultimately how one dies is irrelevant. What matters is what we accomplish in this mortal plane.&#34;</font> She smiled then. Surely the lad would now understand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stared at the woman for a few quiet moments. Trying to process her funny words. Not really understanding most of the spiritual jargon though due to being an idiot. But he did at least understand <i>part</i> of it,

<font color = white>&#34;I &#39;unno man... I think the way you dies matters a ton. If it&#39;s slow and brutal and humiliating that kinda fuckin&#39; sucks. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Like- dying on a mission is one thing. But being put on display for a bunch of kids?!
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I may call you children but.....what do you think happens to someone if you actually hit them with one or two of those paper bombs? It will be much worse than a simple beheading. Truely if you dont behead them soon afterwords it could be very terrible. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Like I said a mission is one thing- But being an example like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: They should've like... Stabbed him in the heart or something. Not beat him up a ton and then sent his head flying like that...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: My sister didn't need to see that...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I disagree....once word spreads it will keep you and your sister safe from harm. The fear will grip those in the shadows thinking of harming us.  
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'd rather not live in a world where everyone's just afraid of one another...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Then you prefer strangers carrying the headband of me, or your sister? The truth is I doubt just a killing will stop us from being attacked if we venture outside the village.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Seems like everyone is sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I never said any of that! Just that friends are less likely to attack you than people who hate you.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hey Chobina. We're just talkin' about the 'class' earlier.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Oh I wasnt there!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: What happened
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: My dad beat up a prisoner really badly and gave a speech about strength being important. Then Kitsumi cut his head off.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: The samurai?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I 'unno. Never saw the guy before.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh, well they shouldnt have done bad! Sucks that they died tough. Death is so scary.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Right?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Finally someone else fuckin' agrees! I swear half our class is like, psychopaths or something. No one seems to care that the dude's blood sprayed the entire front row.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Everyone's just like 'oh death is cool and fine and doesn't matter haha.' And I'm like... Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: It does take a scary mindset to not be off put by death. Even though we are child soliders. death is still scary.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: You need to have a screw loose for this kind of work
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and lets out an exasperated sighs. Mumbling to no one in particular,

<font color = white>&#34;I swear some people even fucking enjoyed the whole ordeal...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Dying on a mission is one thing. You can at least know you did your best. That your squad is trying to avenge you or whatever. But a prisoner like that? In such a brutal way? It's just messed up man..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I don't like that the beast is doing to my dad...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: He wasnt always like that?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head again, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve <b>never</b> seen him get like that before. And I&#39;ve really pissed him off plenty of times. He even had this like... steam or something coming off of him and this weird red chakra...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Scary
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Makes me glad I'll never be picked to be the next vessel.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I can say the same thinking back to my own family.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: You can?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Yea... they were trying to make my family a vessel but he didnt like that and ignoed the rules. So they killed him when he rampaged.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Daaamn... My condolences.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (I was gone 2 secs! A val match started)

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Hey Papaya~
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I hope dad doesn't make that kind of mistake either.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: We will have to grow stronger together to prevent it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Heh, was already the plan! Just another reason to make it happen though.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Mhm~
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Talk of squads was discussed earlier
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Oh, yeah. What kind of stuff are you planning to do Chobina?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Be great, throw rocks, help my friends and get strong!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: No way you wanna throw rocks too?!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean technically my thing is throwing mountains but-
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I bet I can throw mountains eventually~
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I hope so. It'll be lame if I'm the only one who can!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I am known as the rocks thrower.~
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: I knocked a samurai out with one!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No kidding? That's pretty awesome.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I was meaning to inquire about his sword....I had forgot
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Yea it is~
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Maybe next time Papaya
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Papiyas....
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Do you not like the nickname?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: You know- I never asked. Is Papiyas your given name, or your family name?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Given. I am of the Niwa family.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh, good to know.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: In truth...I dont know your or your fathers names
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh- Yeah I was hoping you just heard my name get shouted around or something haha.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm Hideo, he's Mugen, and we're Utsuwa.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And my little sister is Himeki.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) brought her balled-up fists to her eyes, rubbing them gently as if the morning light was too much to bear. She blinked, trying to focus, and as her vision cleared, she found herself squinting at Chobina.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you too, Chobin.,&#34;</font> she said, her voice still held the softness of sleep. She lowered her body into a formal, polite bow, a gesture of respect that seemed almost out of place in the haze of early morning.

Rising slowly, she hesitated, her mind drifting to the conversation she had overheard earlier. Her face adopted a puzzled expression, and she bit her lip, nervousness flickering across her features. The corner of her lips twitched as she struggled with the question she felt compelled to ask.

Fingers twiddling, she finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, <font color = white>&#34;Is it true someone was beheaded?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, they executed a prisoner and made us watch, but that wasn&#39;t the worst part. It was right before that when things got ugly. It still makes me feel sick thinking about it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I have considered taking up the practice myself. If we behead anyone who faces us then noone will question Iwagakure when we step outside our walls.&#34;</font> she yawned again and looked up at the sky.

<font color = white>&#34;About time I rest however....good day children.&#34;</font> she say and give them all a bow before making her way to a bench to snooze.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Lmao, fair
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well we don't have any cool jutsu to train and weapons are super expensive...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: How much more do you need?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: C'mere Fubuki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked up to Hideo. <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (also i gotta run an errand and will brb for 15 mins)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) reaches into his pocket and produces a very crumpled wad of, what was probably, three-hundred ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Here, get a super cool sword.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at the wad of money and immediately shaked her head while waving her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;No, you don&#39;t need to do it really! I appeciate it but like, it&#39;s a lot.&#34;</font> Fubuki spoke quickly due to being flustered, it was an unexpectedly cool moment from Hideo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and gestures with the money again,

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, spending money makes me happy.&#34;</font>

Lowering the money slightly he smiles. How blessed was he that getting money was his primary goal solely because spending it made him happier... He, however, does not miss an opportunity to be slightly snide,

<font color = white>&#34;Even though you&#39;re sometimes mean and lame. You <i>do</i> need a sword so you can actually fight and stuff. All I need is my dad to stop being lazy and teach me jutsu.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i feel rly bad bc i gotta afk even if only for a bit right after this so i dont wanna seem ungrateful ooc)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Lmao dw
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Tyt
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Aw, Hideo's being noble.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm always noble!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched her head while thinking about it, she couldn&#39;t even jokingly bully him. So many people had already helped her and she couldn&#39;t help people back. Eventually she caved in and sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay fine. I accept it if you insist. But for my next katana I&#39;ll try to make the money on my own -- and if you need ANY help, you ask me. You got that?&#34;</font>

She stepped forward and put her hands on her hips, looking at him seemingly upset though her face betrayed her intentions, which were just being serious about her promise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (GRAHHH)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) nods his head and hands her the money, <font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;m immediately calling in my favor; be less mean to me.&#34;</font>

With that handled, he spins to face the old man. Using his still out-stretched hand, now freed of money, to point at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I totally heard you say us having elemental jutsu would be &#39;troublesome&#39;! I&#39;m gonna learn to throw fireballs <b>and</b> mountains and it&#39;ll be the complete opposite of troublesome! It&#39;ll be... helpful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately nodded and grabbed the money, putting it alongside her stash. Just enough for the katana she had ordered.

<font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;ll only be mean if you&#39;re mean to me though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Damn, I guess that's fair.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I appreciate the donation but I won't become a punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have my word I won't start shit though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I would never treat you like one! I'm usually the punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Heh, true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Trust me man I may laugh and smile but it tooootallly sucks most of the time.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If it makes you feel better, I was always joking. Sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, I figured. Thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think Tsuneko may be the only one that actually means it... I 'unno.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nah, she's messing with you too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I don't think anyone actually hates anyone else here.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hrm, I hope so.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) rested his good eye on Hideo while the other glances at Fubuki. He&#39;d let out a troubled sigh as he thought about his days of fighting against ninjutsu.

<font color = white>&#34;Helpful how?&#34;</font>, he questioned as he removed a glass from his sleeve and quickly took a sip.

<font color = white>&#34;You youngsters are something else.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I 'unno I figure throwing mountains could probably help someone somehow. Lemmie get there first. I'll worry about what I do when I'm there, when I'm there!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, very true.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw the man look at them each with a separate eye and couldn&#39;t get that mental image out of her mind. It just might be more traumatizing than yesterday.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, what would be helpful then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Maybe someone will ask me to relocate a mountain range or something heroic like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like, literally carving a path through the mountains or something. That'd probably be super helpful.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Took much plate shifting with cause an earthquake.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'll make the earth stop moving, easy.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hey, I'd be the one carving through the mountains with my sword.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Swords.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fair. But I bet I could just like... rip chunks out of the mountain super easy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Carve a valley with my barehands...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like diggin' through sand at the beach...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) asks: My idea of being helpful is selfish. I would make sure I'd use ninjutsu to protect the crops and livestock! How could I sleep with a full stomach if there's no food?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah but that's like- obvious stuff! I thought wanted unique examples or something!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm a simple man.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: My way of being helpful will be cutting down anyone who attacks us.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tooki(The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) OOCs: ( cya til then
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Boring simple stuff like that... I guess I could make like, pens for animals with earth walls?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Chase off bandits and wolves or whatever with fire?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: Now you're follow the Tooki legacy!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: following* (ffs.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: Heheh, if I was still young could you imagine the luxury I'd have right now?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) had a delusional smile on his face as he remembered the cheers of the crowds that gathered around him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: Tooki, Tooki, Tooki!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Ahh, yes...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Ha, yeah you'd be a real hero I'm sure.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Mm, the small stuff is usually glanced over until those things are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh I guess that's true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I guess all the small stuff would probably be good training too right?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Damn right, if you're going to reach your -goal- then you're gonna have to leave no stone unturned.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think it might be literal stones when it comes to doton training.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, I see what you did there.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Say, Old Man Tooki, what kinds of stuff did you do when you were 'cleaning up the streets'?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was full of energy and brimming with taijutsu mastery.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was gaining experience left and right, finishing fights fast.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) swiftly sent two strikes Eastward. Loud pops from joints, muffled by cloth, bounced from off the mountains.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure I could&#39;ve handled about ten of you youngsters easily.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had only the vaguest understanding of taijutsu basics, if even that. So just seeing two punches performed was enough to convince him.

<font color = white>&#34;A whole ten of us?! Are you sure? Some of us are actually scary strong. Like Katora or Yurei. Buuuuut barring them damn you probably could&#39;ve!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Woah, he actually does know stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: What a time it was to be alive... I think out of fifty, there's only been two farms that were too much to save.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Whoa really? What happened to them?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Too much ninjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: I was completely outclassed!

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I need ninjutsu...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: At that point, I think I reached the peak of taijutsu. Swiftness helped me avoid certain things to close in.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wonder how fast I have to throw a mountain for someone to be unable to just... avoid it with swiftness...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Depends on the person.
