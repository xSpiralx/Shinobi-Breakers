<font color = white>&#34;What in the...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Least no one was Gosame when I was in there last, and no one seemed to come in and out that I have seen, I can easily go look again
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Indeed it is still empty
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I need to start my training.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders while wondering about what Yoru was talking to them about. Calling people <font color = white>&#34;prey&#34;</font> is not something that should be done in public but Gosame had no say in it.

<font color = white>&#34;Yoru...one day you will call someone prey and they will beat you up. Be careful.&#34;</font>

Gosame would say with worried tone, thinking that Yoru might have some sort of brain damage.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read as he would look at the others, he had studdied about various applications and so fourth just basic information on different techniques.

<font color = white>&#34;That is a good question, I will have to talk to big boss in what we excell in and all that. Probably suiton? We are sharks afterall.&#34;</font>

Gosame would say while moving his left hand to his chin in order to think.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) quickly nods his head,

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Then I shall fight the prey and it shall be fun!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would nod to the others, he had heard what they wished to specialize in, as hee would continue to read. <font color = white>&#34;I plan to master the blade, as well as use my formidiable mind to enforce my will on others.&#34;</font> he would say this casually.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would flip to another page casually. <font color = white>&#34;Well we wait, untill the instructor appears for thoose of us who have yet to sign up for the academy Reimi.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;I usually go for a swim when I am bored but...I guess you guys cant reach the depths where I go. But waiting for the instructor is also a thing, so who knows, one might pop up at any given moment.&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Prey will always be prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: And prey must someday fall
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods towards Yoru, he understood him completely. Other villages were prey but not their friends.

<font color = white>&#34;Remember Yoru. People we protect are friends, prey is outside the walls.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Everyone is prey. Inside or out?

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: This is for learning, prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Sizuken didn't say anything earlier?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: I havent seen pops yet but....I am not sure. If you calling people prey causes issues you might have to stop it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But I am not going to force it unless it causes issues.

He then looks off into the distance for a moment. 

His hound too would tilt it&#39;s head and look back at his brother from another mother for a moment. Mosai would simply nod his head causing the large hound to run off.

<font color = white>&#34;Guess the trip here took more out of me than I exepected.&#34;</font> They sighed into the wraps before standing to explore</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) shook their head. It seemed that the village was at a time of rest. People laid about all over sleeping on the streets in many cases. They had even spotted several of the students they had met before.

<font color = white>&#34;I suppose its all fine. Surely I did not miss much during my slumber.&#34;</font> they self assured making way down the steps</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) sighed loudly. It had taken them forever but they finally found the location. The Mission man had dismissed their questions for directions off as if it was stupid to ask.

<font color = white>&#34;I have never traveled so far alone....I even came upon that other large village the Leaf.&#34;</font> The complained before looking skyward then around.

&#39;Where is this person? I do not care for this wait one bit....&#39;</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) was speaking with the man trying to convince them to let them deliver some more packages until a voice called out to them.

<font color = white>&#34;If it was not you saying that I would be offended. I am unsure. I have seen afew sleeping about the village but no more.&#34;</font> they said in their muffled way. Accompying it with a shrug</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) slowly walked closer while tilting his head. He still couldn&#39;t understand his blunder of considering everyone as prey. Where ws there offense to be taken when it was simply a food chian.

<font color = white>&#34;Why are preys always sleeping? How will you ever stop being prey?&#34;</font> He sighed as stopped a short distance away from the person. At least he wasn&#39;t asleep. Maybe he was getting stronger?

He would place the shuriken into his cowl pocket.

Her features remained unchanged, her face an unmoving mask, as she walked closer to the group. Their voices rose and fell in a rhythm that didn't penetrate her consciousness. Shizuku's expressionless stare remained focused, her mind untouched by their words.

She was lost in a thick train of thought. Her mind set on her father's words and what they meant for her as a young Shinobi of a prominent clan. When the crowd was nearby, she stopped and fixated her stare on the people near her.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The kid&#39;s pinky flicks a bugger from out his nose then after, he rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

 <font color = white>&#34;Hehehe, yeah! My papa said you have to kill the prey, always!&#34;</font> He shouted.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) looked at Gilly for a second for a second skin as blue as the water he shrugged for a moment as he looked at the kid and then to Sora he started to wonder how the 14 years wasn&#39;t an genin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) To be fair, Gilly didn&#39;t know how old he was. Being only 4&#39;7 and having such soft fish features, one could assume he was anywhere between five and ten. Eitherway, he shrugs his shoulders grinning.
 <font color = white>&#34;Four and teen? That&#39;s pretty old!&#34;</font> 

 He looks over at E nodding. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re four and teen too!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) quickly covered his mouth as he seem to be gross out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: I think that is something to be jailed for.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: Papa says when you drop a egg, you're mating!
