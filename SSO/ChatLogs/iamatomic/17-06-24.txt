wrapping her arm in a bandage...very..um..very quickly...only to reveal....a bandaged arm..mm...but that was besides the point.

<font color = white>&#34;you see...if you become a medic...you can have cool bandanged arms like this!&#34;</font>

SHe paused

<font color = white>&#34;and then..you can do this...&#34;</font>

The medic swung back their bandaged arm..her body later jiggled...and the motion..actived some ...each sudden lost calorie from that high active movement..caused her seal to activate and bandage emited a poof of smoke..only to show a shuriken floating above her hand and later falling in the center of her palm!

A light laughter lefter left her lips..thought it did sound dangerous.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) says: You moved there on purpose.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) snorts, looking away with her arms crossed, displaying her indifference to his response. <font color = white>&#34;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&#34;</font> she said, eyes shut tightly. Then, she peeks with a single eye, and retorts, <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s no surprise a beast only finds their own kind attractive.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) whips his head back over to the smart alecky girl who hadn&#39;t refused to shut up even now. It sounded like she was going to say something profound all the way up until the end, to which he glares and huffs, eyes now wide and still widening. <font color = white>&#34;Oh yeah!?&#34;</font>

Kaji does not mimic her pose, instead shoving a finger just under her chin. <font color = white>&#34;Well then behold,&#34;</font> His fingers press together and he snaps as if to get their attention. <font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s no beauty to be found here at all.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: The lunch bell rung right....WHere is it being held.
<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) asks: Lunch bell?
<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) says: Didn't hear it.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: Hmmm They said a bell rung...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) asks: Hmmm did I get tricked?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) furrowed her brows, her expression unable to mask her bottled fury. She was now facing him, fingers clutching his shirt tightly, as she shouts, <font color = white>&#34;Huh?! I&#39;m way more beautiful than you could ever be, you idiot!&#34;</font> Although she was taught to avoid physical contact in altercations, she couldn&#39;t prevent herself from lashing out. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) wraps his fingers around the wrist of her hand that held him. It seems they were locked in a stalemate for the time being but with a few choiced words, perhaps he could turn this situation into one with an advantage? <font color = white>&#34;You, other kid. Seeing this, right? She&#39;s trying to muscle me into saying she&#39;s pretty. Why don&#39;t you tell her what you think of her?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) tilts his head to the side. His opponets had outsmarted him in the midst of combat by teling him a bell rung and it seemd as though no such thing happend..

He looks the girl over.... He remembers what she said.. <font color = white>&#34;Uhhhhhh  Jalapeno Pepper.&#34;</font>

He then gives the  beige haird youth a head nod.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chonamu(The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) OOCs: (I mean if your claiming to be beatufil it'd help lol )

<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) yells: That has nothing to do with how ugly she is!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chonamu(The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) OOCs: (lol  wild neither of you have a pic )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sakujak, Kaji(The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) OOCs: (nope...)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) whipped her head back, her sharp, cold gaze bearing down on the heavy-breathing kid. “Well?! I'm pretty, am I not?! You wouldn't let this hooligan harm such a cute, defenseless girl with their insults, would you?!”

During her outburst, she felt her grip loosen. The beige-haired youth's strength was naturally greater than her own, given their gender, and she was left wincing as the pain from her strained effort set in.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) asks: Harm!?

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) yells: Get off!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) doesn&#39;t even allow the large boy to have a word before he begins speaking up, once more gesturing with his eyes to the now superior hold he has upon her. He finds that the tables have turned suddenly, though perhaps it wasn&#39;t good. <font color = white>&#34;Oh? Where&#39;s my please? My &#39;sorry for grabbing you&#39;, huh?&#34;</font> The scowl spreads out into a thin smirk. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) blinks a few times.. <font color = white>&#34;My sister says Girls never need a boy to save them....

<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) says: Yeah. What he said.
<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) says: Show me.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) says: E-Eeek...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) &#39;s cheeks puffed as she found herself overwhelmed by the boy&#39;s superior might, beginning to regret ever starting the altercation to begin with. And now, with nowhere to flee, and no one to call upon, she saw herself in a big dilemma. Her eyes shut tightly, praying for assistance, but alas, none would come. She could only rely on herself and her own ability.
 <font color = white>&#34;I said... Get off me!&#34;</font> she screamed.

In a fury of emotions, she aimed to wrench her arms away from his hold, using every ounce of strength within her. As desperation fueled her actions, she swung her head forward, intending to collide their foreheads. The impact, though painful, created just enough distance between them. She staggered back, her breath ragged, eyes burning with defiance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) would hear a loud bang.. Chonamu&#39;s heavy breathing would stop <font color = white>&#34;Hey ..You two stop goofing off something is happening.&#34;</font>

The cubby kid dashes off to go see what all the commition was about.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) finds an increasingly amusing feeling surfacing from within. The inexplainable sensation thriving when face to face with the girl having realized she bit off more than she could currently chew. It didn&#39;t make him feel strong, no, he always knew boys were just better than girls at things like fighting.

But maybe it was just seeing her eat her words? That was possibly the reason he felt so pleased with the current situation. Of course it doesn&#39;t stay that way as while the dark haired, onyx eyed girl is attempting to wrestle her hand free, he is unaware of her second method. 

He crumples under the pressure of a forehead. <font color = white>&#34;You---! Fat headed, wide forehead! Aaaugh, did you break my skull!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) 
On the contrary, Suzaku was desperately trying to overcome her fear of physical confrontation with a kid. To her fortune and surprise, their heads collided with a resounding thud, sending a sharp pain through her skull and knocking her off her feet and onto her backside.

She rubbed the point of impact, the pain a stark reminder to avoid such interactions unless absolutely necessary. Tears welled in the corners of her eyes, and with reddened cheeks puffed in indignation, she pointed an accusing finger at the beige-haired youth.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to touch me, you idiot!&#34;</font> she shouted, her voice trembling with anger. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m just a fragile little girl. It&#39;s not like I could hurt you, even if I tried!&#34;</font>

She sniffled, raising her hands to her eyes to catch the tears before they could fall and reveal her vulnerability. Then, she paused, her lips curving into a defiant smirk. Despite her display of weakness, she refused to concede defeat. <font color = white>&#34;Staying true to your kind, huh? Only a beast resorts to violence!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Uchiha, Suzaku has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) grumbles and groans as silently and dignified as he can, the point where they&#39;d connected still stinging with a sharp twinge every now and then. As much as his eyes watered, he glared at the now fallen dark aesthetic girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;There was no way I was going to let you get away with scrunching up my shirt just because your ego wouldn&#39;t let you be called &#39;ugly&#39;!&#34;</font> And look, look at what became of them because of her bruised pride. Her unwillingness to let it go. They both were now on their butts and in pain.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) would cross her arms behind her back and and took afew paces closer as she gave her first offfer. 

<font color = white>&#34;I was thinking 50 ryo as a down payment. with 50% Interest on the final payment. Practically robbing me blind Oji-san.&#34;</font> she said stopping and see if the mask of being senile fell at that. 

Afterall....what merchant let age get in the way of profits?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yells: 5 ryo for a... ladle!? I just told you it's 20! I am too old for you to scam brat!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) scoffed, he was driving a hard bargin. She was hoping to buy the expensive sake tonight. 

<font color = white>&#34;Very well....100 Ryo down. For a Sword, nothing named mind you. But sufficent to cut down rats or the poor.&#34;</font> even as her words had ended, she had drew closer to the man. Her firey gaze locked to him and not wandering mindlessly up at the clouds or at a book. 

<font color = white>&#34;This deal to get me armed will go down in writing of course. Papiyas Niwa always recalls those who help her.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) raises an eyebrow out of confusion..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was now before the old man. She was now clearly furious at this game. <font color = white>&#34;I said nothing about a ladle&#34;</font> she spat out before taking a deep breath. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am offering you all the ryo I have on me as a down payment for a Katana. This is the third and final time I shall repeat myself. Less I am the fool.&#34;</font> She reached out her gloved hand, tensed and clearly ready to slap something should the word ladle be brought up again

<font color = white>&#34;Do we have a deal?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Katana?

The supply chain has slowed down and it will affect sales for the next couple of months! So forget katanas!&#34;</font>

He shakes his head, beside, women were better with a ladle in hand rather than a sword.. though he would keep that opinion to himself, he knew that recently some weird movement called womanism was gaining popularity..</font></font></font>

She spun then. <font color = white>&#34;Old dullards here to leer at women. I will be sure to let everyone I meet know to not buy from you or your equally bald friend.&#34;</font> she spat in the direction of the other one who had nothing to say but complaints.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Careful what toes you step on. This naughty girl does not respect her elders.&#34;</font> with that she gave a flip of her hair and had a seat, intent on going back to her reading. 

<font color = white>&#34;and I am a women grown. I am sure you have forgot what they look like stareing at whatever gargoyle your wives are.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns from the librarys and seats himself near a tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) pulls his heaven bound gaze down to the earth. <font color = white>&#34;Hello, Shuye.&#34;</font>, he greets gentley.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Did you find any good books?
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Uchiha, Suzaku has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shook his head ever so slightly as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;Nothing on Xing.&#34;</font>
All his time at the library and all he&#39;d come to learn within this particular study was that the village had a severe lack of information surrounding foreign languages.
     Though, he didn&#39;t fault them. Books of the nature seemed to pale in comparison to those focused around Shinobi forefronts needs such as combat, tactical and medical guides. 

    <i><font color = white>&#34;Perhaps they were more important.&#34;</font></i> - he thought, dull eyes seeming to peer into the ethereal realm between both him and Shyue as his mind began to race.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed briefly and subtly surprised, based off the widening and then narrowing of her eyes. She tried to remember if there were any books at home she could give him.

<font color = white>&#34;No luck learning a new language, then. There&#39;s a saying -- Rù xiāng suí sú.&#34;</font> The shift to a harsher, tonal language was jarring. <font color = white>&#34;When entering a village, follow its customs.&#34;</font>

Her people, few as they were, had taken that to heart.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) finds his focus pulled back in once more amongst the girl&#39;s shift into a different, natural tongue only to shift back into the one&#39;s he&#39;d come to know seemlessly.
    <font color = white>&#34;Mm..&#34;</font> - He seems to think for a moment, his eyes drifting toward her feet.

 <font color = white>&#34;Why are you here?&#34;</font>, he questions.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) tucked her hands into her sleeves, letting her almost minty green sleeves hang on either side. <font color = white>&#34;My clan lost their home. My dad says that the entire tribe travelled east until the land ended, and then built sailing ships and continued east until they found land again. Then...&#34;</font> She seemed a little unsure to continue, remembering how some of the other children had spoke about the shogunate, and about the previous kage--

<font color = white>&#34;...I don&#39;t really remember much, since I was so young. But my tribe met the shogun. We moved in here, to Iwagakure. My mom was...&#34;</font> more hesitation. <font color = white>&#34;...a chosen servant of the shogun, and he settled us here. But the duel of fates is cruel, so after my youngest sibling, she was--&#34;</font>

A moment was taken to remeasure her emotions, and settle them <font color = white>&#34;--released from her burden. Wán bì guī zhào.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) ears gave lifeless, near robotic analysis in the face of Shyue's rather obvious deterents from certain parts of her story. Upon her concluding her origin he continued to stare at the ground bellow her for a moment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: . . .
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks up at her for a moment.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) Then, back to the ground.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Are you lying?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) quirked a brow.

<font color = white>&#34;Why would I?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm not sure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) stepped forward.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you want me to be lying?&#34;</font> She questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eventually found his ground bound gaze consumed by the being before him&#39;s abdomen and he drags his gaze up to their own once more.
   He was unphased by their proximity.<font color = white>&#34;No.&#34;</font>, he answers.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crouched down, leveling herself with him. She let a moment of silence linger.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you have any questions?&#34;</font> She offered. <font color = white>&#34;If there is no book, at least I can be a primary source.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) blinks for a moment, a dreamy haze overtaking his pupils as he began ot think.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) 's pupils would fill in.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: What is your goal here?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I want to become the greatest medical shinobi to ever live. It's a humble goal.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Why?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: What is your route?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned, returning to the most natural expression she seemed to wear-- a scowl. This one is less directed. Internal. Her joke didn&#39;t seem to land. Finally, she seemed to come up with her answer.

<font color = white>&#34;I have no enemy except death. Therefore, I will deny it any victim, at every opportunity. I will slight it in every way I can. It took something important from me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen even so slightly as she spoken. She..
  Well she seemed to be just about his age yet she knew her. <font color = white>&#34;Purpose.&#34;</font>
    He says aloud.

   <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a beautiful thing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) would smile from ear to ear; a rare sight. Even her teeth were visible, however briefly before she regathered her composure.

<font color = white>&#34;I have to be strong for my little siblings.&#34;</font> Her dad was -- kind, but broken. Shuye had to at once be a mother and a sister to her siblings, lest they grow up to be idiots and get themselves hurt. It left little time for being young and playful. <font color = white>&#34;So... I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to make friends.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: You don't have many friends?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked over at Venturo--

<font color = white>&#34;I think one, maybe. But I&#39;m also concerned he&#39;s going to try to trick me into eating a rock.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Hey Fubuki

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I lost.. I got jumped by the six armed girl and her cousin
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Damn. Must be really hard to dodge six arms, or twelve.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Morning.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Hey sensei!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) shook her head.

<font color = white>&#34;I typically am the one who has to say hello first.&#34;</font> Did that mean you weren&#39;t popular? Shuye wasn&#39;t entirely sure, but it felt like it was true. The difference between being wanted and being tolerated could be subtle at times.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hm? What's up?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-ah..well..i may as well..teach you the the advanced basics of combat..since your awake mhm

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) jumped towards the arena with no hesitation, she seemed really excited immediately.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m ready I&#39;m ready!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would raise up from her crawling position and placed her hands on her hips...her judo kimono fluttering before its motion..stopped.

<font color = white>&#34;W-well..well...its good your enthusiastic...lets get to the center of the area...mhm!&#34;</font>

She then moved to the center!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: stay...right there
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walkd to the center and bowed down respectfully for a few seconds, before standing up and getting into a better fighting stance compared to last time.

<font color = white>&#34;As you wi--&#34;</font>

Then it was her biggest nightmare.

<font color = white>&#34;FUCK!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) was in the process of holding out the crystalline monkey to Shuye as he&#39;s kicked in the chest. A pathetic grunt is shouted out as he is sent straight into the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Guh!&#34;</font>

Unfortunately he was a big kid and his clothes were now soaked. So rather than simply swim back to edge like a normal person; he flailed around helplessly for a few seconds. Splashing water everywhere and toward all those nearby. Before eventually realizing the moat wasn&#39;t very deep.

And remembering that he could walk on water. With a sigh he plants his hands on the surface of the water and pulls himself up and out. Shaking in place like a dog, trying to get rid of at least some of the water. Which, was almost entirely futile.

Grumbling to himself he returns to his spot and glares at his father.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to call me a bastard too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) asks: Hey, Mugen. On a scale of one-to-ten, how cool do you think a crystal statue of him would be?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Is there a Negative? option.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I can't believe you'd say that about your eldest son...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Your only son!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Whats tewelve more years, make another one. Start again.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Y-You wouldn't...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: We can seal him away, Mugen.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Just say the word...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Please don't...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) The boy was gone before she could blink. Before the wind hit the back of her kimono from the man's movement. He was in the water before the surface tension broke and bubbled. But still, Shuye had her hands out, and managed to catch the monkey before it fell to the ground. Would it have shattered? Probably not. But they didn't need to know.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) smiles brightly as she holds up a single seal. In that very moment, the ground beneath Hideo would begin to crystalize, slowly crawling up his legs.

Well, slowly to her. To him? It was a near instant encapsulation!

As it finally reached up to his neck, she stopped the crystals and turned to Mugen.
 <font color = white>&#34;Tada!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) sips the moat water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) looks down at the crystals growing beneath him. Quickly looking toward Kitsumi he shout,

<font color = white>&#34;No! Release me! I command y-&#34;</font>

Before being cut off and entombed in a gemstone prison. His smooth brain now perfectly immoratlized in crystaline form.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Blankly staring at the iron vessel and the pale-skinned girl, the child only had the energy to blink in a lazy manner, with cruelty on full display. Getting involved might result in their scandalous activities being directed towards him after all.

As crystals crept up Hideo's frame, the reticent young boy confirmed their insanity, taking solace in the natural concealment offered by the bark of the rather large tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The lumberjack, jack-Kristuria) begins to tirelessly swing a large axe at the tree before him. He didn't have a permit and this was illegal.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) taps the frozen statue of his son, with a finger tentatively, considering how long he should leave him like that.
<font color = white>&#34;He can breath in there right&#34;</font>?,he asked dispite enjoying tormenting the lad, he was his father after all.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uhm...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Probably not!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) retracts the crystals just enough to free his nose.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now he can!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Ah good.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately inhales sharply. His nostrils flaring as he breathes. And, while he couldn't move his jaw, he could shit spew a stream of expletives. Granted the sound comes out of his nose as a garbled grunt that was completely incomprehensible. But it made him feel better.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: I think he likes it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: AHOUKINGAOLESEEIEOU!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: ELEASEEIOMMANDI!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Whoaaaa...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Whats going on?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: More torture.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: I wanna do that sometime.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kamei, Hitoshi(The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) OOCs: (Crashed)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Brb I ain't even eat breakfast yet, damn...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa Guard (The masked guard-ChainsOfMadness) turns off as he begins glancing around, it would’ve been a lie if he said he’d seen the young boy integrate himself.

With a quiet sigh, he barks to the reticent young boy. <font color = white>&#34;Come on, we didn’t travel all the way from Akhibara just for you to shy away. Meet your peers, make some friends, you’re back home now.&#34;</font>

He approaches the boy hiding behind the tree, mostly obscured. The man had very excellent hearing though, and could tell just who was behind there. <font color = white>&#34;Don’t be afraid of them&#34;</font> he says aloud whilst thinking &#39;they should probably be afraid of you&#39;

He motions forward, <font color = white>&#34;come on, Hitoshi. You’ll need to make friends so we can get you a proper squad after graduation&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I didn't expect that from you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked at the two toned headed youth, withaa puzzled expression. He wanted to torture people? The jounin simply shook his head and returned his attention towards his crystalized son.

<font color = white>&#34;Well did you learn your lesson&#34;</font>?,he asked with a smirk on his face, awaiting the boys response.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: So... should I...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Put the monkey down...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) held it awkwardly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: It's not mine.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Released dread into the atmosphere, metaphorically dampening the air with its mere presence alone. The tired, cold eyes of the hiding boy peered from around the bark. They had become engaged with the Iwa guards. How did the guard ever surmise that the reticent boy happened to be positioned behind the tree?

Shifting a defeated and exhausted gaze to the floor, a steady flow of air is sucked through the hiding one's nostrils. Coming out from behind the tree, the 5'3 boy became more visible, appearing to be frail dressed in comfy clothes and sporting unkempt hair.

No words were offered to the Iwagakure guard, even if the child obliged their request.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: OIinoearnmesson. Ourolansmea. Sueleaseumoneyown.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks behind him and would see a kid hiding behind a tree; assuming he was shy and hearing what the Iwa Gaurd he&#39;d think about introducing himself and saying hI to the other kid.

Getting up from where he was sitting he&#39;d walk towards the other kid, Kuro was scratching his face a bit while looking at the other kid. <font color = white>&#34;hey that tree doesn&#39;t give much cover, you should try a wall.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say before laughing a bit trying to be funny and trying to lighten things up. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kuro, and you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Uchiha, Suzaku has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) could only continue to aggressively mumble through his nose in response to his father and Shuye.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked towards the scowling red eye girl. 
<font color = white>&#34;Monkey&#34;</font>?,he asked her with a tilt of his head, rasing his fist and cracking open the crystal prison which held his son captive.

<font color = white>&#34;Where did you get a monkey lassie&#34;</font>?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) says: Damn.. I heard a rumor some guy got encased in crystal..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It's crazy how that strength doesn't even break the crystal..)
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I mean. He's right there. In front of you.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Lmao
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was indeed holding a crystal monkey. It wasn&#39;t that big, but it wasn&#39;t small either. She looked to the pale-skinned girl, then at her victim and the man&#39;s son.

<font color = white>&#34;Hideo bought it from her.&#34;</font> She answered, matter-of-factly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) blinks awkwardly as Mugen&#39;s hand slams against her Crystal.
 <font color = white>&#34;Uh.. Do you want me to release him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) says: Rumors sure do travel fast..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [foundation breaker!!]
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You're not wrong. At the speed of light, really.
<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers: (It's A+ power)
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It's A+ power)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) swims away in the moat like a salmon.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (And that's without me flashing perks :3)
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers: (I could...)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) continues shouting through his nose. Now, clearly laughing, as his father's hand hits the crystal and fails to break it. Granted the laughing sounds more like a struggling wheeze as his chest couldn't really move to breathe enough to properly laugh.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa Guard (The masked guard-ChainsOfMadness) looks at the young boy with a smile, though it wouldn’t be seen behind the mask

<font color = white>&#34;Much better, I’ve got some duties to run but you be good now. And no…losing control ya?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
