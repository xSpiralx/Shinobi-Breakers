Admittedly she too was a bit air-headed and hadn&#39;t even realized she won. But to lose whilst unaware was an entirely different thing.

She decided to draw a final card but did not flip it up this time around. She merely placed it down face down and ended her turn.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game.&#34;</font> as he hand pulled off of the card she turned it at the wrist, palm outstretched. <font color = white>&#34;You owe me a lot of money.&#34;</font> she said, still grinning and awaiting her deposit.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) Five-Hundred Ryo. Down the drain.

For what, exactly? He didn't really <i>want</i> the money. Only the victory, but he couldn't even afford that much. His brain was circling indefinitely: the character for six, dancing about his head, collapsing on his thoughts with a paperweight keeping a stack from falling--though the stack is stacked too high, the paperweight only uses the stack as a diving boad and knocks it over. Translating every piece of paper with one singular character.

<b><i>6</b></i>

Two-Hundred Ryo, a crumpled mess--caused wholeheartedly by himself, returned back to its rightful wielder.

And....And now....

And now.... The remaining three-hundred.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled softly as a sum of money was placed in her palm. She uncrinkled the mess of it and instead of feeling happiness, she was confused. Her head fell to a tilt. <font color = white>&#34;I must be losing my vision.. Or I can&#39;t count properly.&#34;</font> she said. She lifted the money to hold it up to the sun but with all the sand, dirt and debris flying about it was hard to see fully. Nevertheless it was painfully obvious; this was not 500 ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Is this going to transform into 500 in a moment?&#34;</font> she asked, lowering the money now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: T-T-T-Tha....Is T-wo...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Two...Two-Hu.....
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Where's the rest, Blueberry?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I-I...t It is.....
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: This is even less than you counted on my head.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why are you holding out on me?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: He'll pay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) wore the slightest condolence in his eyes, for the dark side of gambling throwing someone into the red so rapidly and mercilessly. He gave slow shakes of head to the scene. 

<font color = white>&#34;Gambling is truly a dangerous vice.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Good evening, Hideo. I'm surprised you didn't join them.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Got tired of losing ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair, fair.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) How could he have been defeated!?

Actually

<b>BANG</b>

The boy knocked himself in the head, sticking out his tongue, Gon style.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry. Forgot one thing. I&#39;ve never won a single time I&#39;ve partook in such a challenge.&#34;</font>

He unveiled the final remains of the Ryo, smacking Reilin on the head playfully.
<font color = white>&#34;I would&#39;ve suspected a bloodhound such as yoruself to be able to recognize the stench of a proper sum... Ah well, suppose not.&#34;</font>
He still has the audacity to goad? Well, of course he does.
<i>He lost, he doesn&#39;t have anything left to lose anyhow.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hehehe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) side eyes Reilin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Suppose that settle's that, then.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Did he ever pay the remainder from the previous bet?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Youuuuuuu.....
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Feels like I'm watching a crime.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Financial Murder. In broad daylight. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I believe the term is.... Extortion..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s glee quickly returned to her. She added the remaining 300 to her stack of cash and thumbed through it to validate that it was all there. Once it was, the Uchiha tucked it away neatly in her kimono for safe keeping.

Though her smile had not faded just yet, she looked at him expectantly and without saying anything. Wide-eyed and staring. She heard his most recent words and this was her reaction. An unwavering stare, eyebrows risen in arches.

Finally breaking her silence. <font color = white>&#34;As I clarified before we began -and- you agreed. I get the 500 -and- you become my subordinate.. Did ya&#39; foerget?&#34;</font> she asked. <font color = white>&#34;I believe -your- response was... &#39;Should you retain the victory.&#39;..&#34;</font> her fingertips found themselves instinctively creating a finger-pryamid. Villainy.

<font color = white>&#34;Did ya&#39; forget? Huh? Did ya&#39;, did ya&#39;?&#34;</font> her brows rose even more, if that were possible. <font color = white>&#34;I guess -I- forgot about the initial 30 you still owed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. It's why I stay away from high-stakes gambles.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: A-Ah.. Subor...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (who took a bigger L. The prisoner or Meixun? find out next time on Shinobi Breaker Z)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Aaah soo sorrie! Not from dees land, no understand many words! Wel--Okey ByeBye Now!&#34;</font> 

He makes a mad dash for it, a maddeningly mad dash for it. So mad of a dash that the dust storm seemed to hold a horizontal vortex where Meixun once stood.

<font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Tomorrow! I promise you&#39;ll be allowed to... Aah! We shall discuss it further tomorrow!!!</b></i>&#34;</font> He screamed into the storm while fleeing.

[Gettin tf outta dodge]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) slicked his hair back, to uncover his ear. Almost believing that he&#39;s misheard them just now.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh. She&#39;s even becoming his Boss now? What&#39;s next? Did you wager years of each other&#39;s lifespans too?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Crazy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) hadn&#39;t expected this turn of events to unfold. Meixun made a run for it! And a fast one too. Much too fast for her to keep up with even if she wanted. Though she didn&#39;t mind, he&#39;d have to come around sooner or later. 

<font color = white>&#34;Right. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be seein&#39; ya&#39;, Henchmen #1.&#34;</font> she called out as he disappeared out into the storm.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m gettin&#39; pretty tired though. All this winning at life as got me feeling exhausted!&#34;</font> she yawned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Well. Congratulations on the new Minion. I guess? 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Thank you. I've got a good one, he's quite fast. I hadn't a clue.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (Uchiha can still learn Raiton right?)
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True, but it might be the debt-slave fear breaking his natural limiters.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (I can't keep up)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) a few seconds would pass before the group would hear a loud <font size=+3> thud </font> outside the Uchiha Clan walls.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: If not? He's faster than me. Impressive.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. She was aware of the direction he&#39;d ran into.

<font color = white>&#34;Well that&#39;s poetic.. I imagine he&#39;s standing right under my Clan&#39;s insignia right now... Ran from me, just for the world to show him who he belonged to anyhow.&#34;</font> she mused at the idea.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Why did you call him Henchman number one? Are you planning to get more?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: ---
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Classmates are friends, Reilin. Not property.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Honestly!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Oi, oi
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I won him fair and square. He's my blueberry now.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: With his luck? Yeah, I can see that happening.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Never bet high, Hideo. Never bet high.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: It's not abuse. He can't gamble anymore now.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'll get 'em clean.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Gettin' more henchmen ain't a bad thing. I mean I won't 'own' 'em or nothin'.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Are these allegations true, Mister Hideo?

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Yeah we will. Yeah I am. You?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yep.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'm only missing two things.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Which would be?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A decent pair of squad members who use skills that work well with my own.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yeah? Sounds challenging.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Getting some insider details from your Dad, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ahh. I might've missed that bit.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: For sure.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: How about you? Have you done the chakra-paper-test in class yet?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Ha, did it a long time ago!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: What'd you get?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Mm. Never a bad idea to dabble. 
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Sounds like you kids have it all figured out. A solid duo
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Maybe. How about you, Papiyas? Given your future any thought?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: I know you have your Kenjutsu... but will you branch out?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I second that. Finding suitable squadmates demands a bit more thought.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You'll be trusting one another with your lives, after all. There's a lot to consider.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Man, I've never been up this late. Is it always this quiet?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: More or less. But there tends to be a high point
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Oh yeah? When's it gonna be you think?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: At any point....but its truely up in the air. My life has moved so fast it nearly feels like it could all be condensed down into afew days.....or perhaps I am rambling hahaha
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Could always peek at the gates or up where the business from earlier took place. Surely some Shinobi are lingering about
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) nods her head. She could understand the feeling. <font color = white>&#34;They say all return to heaven. Even the bad are recycled. So not something to fret about.&#34;</font> 
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Oh? Hmm....I cannot say I understand your worries then.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Y-You don't have a problem with watchin' a guy get his head bashed in, and then sent flying? And a your classmates covered in his blood?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) hummed again. She stroked her chin as she gave the boys words some consideration. She had hardly dwelled on the events, afterall she knew what she signed up for. 

<font color = white>&#34;No I cannot say it is that suprising. I have seen death tho not so.....graphic.&#34;</font> her voice trailed in a moment of thought. 

<font color = white>&#34;I signed up to be a Shinobi, once in history it was the custom to sever your kills heads to prove you had done your job. All is mandated by heaven, ultimately how one dies is irrelevant. What matters is what we accomplish in this mortal plane.&#34;</font> She smiled then. Surely the lad would now understand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stared at the woman for a few quiet moments. Trying to process her funny words. Not really understanding most of the spiritual jargon though due to being an idiot. But he did at least understand <i>part</i> of it,

<font color = white>&#34;I &#39;unno man... I think the way you dies matters a ton. If it&#39;s slow and brutal and humiliating that kinda fuckin&#39; sucks. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Like- dying on a mission is one thing. But being put on display for a bunch of kids?!
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I may call you children but.....what do you think happens to someone if you actually hit them with one or two of those paper bombs? It will be much worse than a simple beheading. Truely if you dont behead them soon afterwords it could be very terrible. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Like I said a mission is one thing- But being an example like that?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I disagree....once word spreads it will keep you and your sister safe from harm. The fear will grip those in the shadows thinking of harming us.  
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Then you prefer strangers carrying the headband of me, or your sister? The truth is I doubt just a killing will stop us from being attacked if we venture outside the village.
