<font color = white>&#34;S-Sixth.... Bout...&#34;</font> The sixth bout? Didn&#39;t he choose animal? An--

<i>She won the sixth bout</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What did I disrupt?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled a shit-eating grin. Looking directly toward Meixun. She relished in her victory, soaking in his expression right now as the realization had dawned on him. He&#39;d lost. He&#39;d lost without even knowing it. Admittedly she too was a bit air-headed and hadn&#39;t even realized she won. But to lose whilst unaware was an entirely different thing.

She decided to draw a final card but did not flip it up this time around. She merely placed it down face down and ended her turn.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game.&#34;</font> as he hand pulled off of the card she turned it at the wrist, palm outstretched. <font color = white>&#34;You owe me a lot of money.&#34;</font> she said, still grinning and awaiting her deposit.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Good luck getting it, Reilin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) Five-Hundred Ryo. Down the drain.

For what, exactly? He didn't really <i>want</i> the money. Only the victory, but he couldn't even afford that much. His brain was circling indefinitely: the character for six, dancing about his head, collapsing on his thoughts with a paperweight keeping a stack from falling--though the stack is stacked too high, the paperweight only uses the stack as a diving boad and knocks it over. Translating every piece of paper with one singular character.

<b><i>6</b></i>

Two-Hundred Ryo, a crumpled mess--caused wholeheartedly by himself, returned back to its rightful wielder.

And....And now....

And now.... The remaining three-hundred.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled softly as a sum of money was placed in her palm. She uncrinkled the mess of it and instead of feeling happiness, she was confused. Her head fell to a tilt. <font color = white>&#34;I must be losing my vision.. Or I can&#39;t count properly.&#34;</font> she said. She lifted the money to hold it up to the sun but with all the sand, dirt and debris flying about it was hard to see fully. Nevertheless it was painfully obvious; this was not 500 ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Is this going to transform into 500 in a moment?&#34;</font> she asked, lowering the money now.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Just wasn't in the mood
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair, fair.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) How could he have been defeated!?

Actually

<b>BANG</b>

The boy knocked himself in the head, sticking out his tongue, Gon style.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry. Forgot one thing. I&#39;ve never won a single time I&#39;ve partook in such a challenge.&#34;</font>

He unveiled the final remains of the Ryo, smacking Reilin on the head playfully.
<font color = white>&#34;I would&#39;ve suspected a bloodhound such as yoruself to be able to recognize the stench of a proper sum... Ah well, suppose not.&#34;</font>
He still has the audacity to goad? Well, of course he does.
<i>He lost, he doesn&#39;t have anything left to lose anyhow.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hehehe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) side eyes Reilin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Suppose that settle's that, then.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Did he ever pay the remainder from the previous bet?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Youuuuuuu.....
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Meeeeeeeeee....
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Feels like I'm watching a crime.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Financial Murder. In broad daylight. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I believe the term is.... Extortion..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Its a crime he commit against himself, really.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s glee quickly returned to her. She added the remaining 300 to her stack of cash and thumbed through it to validate that it was all there. Once it was, the Uchiha tucked it away neatly in her kimono for safe keeping.

Though her smile had not faded just yet, she looked at him expectantly and without saying anything. Wide-eyed and staring. She heard his most recent words and this was her reaction. An unwavering stare, eyebrows risen in arches.

Finally breaking her silence. <font color = white>&#34;As I clarified before we began -and- you agreed. I get the 500 -and- you become my subordinate.. Did ya&#39; foerget?&#34;</font> she asked. <font color = white>&#34;I believe -your- response was... &#39;Should you retain the victory.&#39;..&#34;</font> her fingertips found themselves instinctively creating a finger-pryamid. Villainy.

<font color = white>&#34;Did ya&#39; forget? Huh? Did ya&#39;, did ya&#39;?&#34;</font> her brows rose even more, if that were possible. <font color = white>&#34;I guess -I- forgot about the initial 30 you still owed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. It's why I stay away from high-stakes gambles.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: A-Ah.. Subor...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (who took a bigger L. The prisoner or Meixun? find out next time on Shinobi Breaker Z)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Aaah soo sorrie! Not from dees land, no understand many words! Wel--Okey ByeBye Now!&#34;</font> 

He makes a mad dash for it, a maddeningly mad dash for it. So mad of a dash that the dust storm seemed to hold a horizontal vortex where Meixun once stood.

<font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Tomorrow! I promise you&#39;ll be allowed to... Aah! We shall discuss it further tomorrow!!!</b></i>&#34;</font> He screamed into the storm while fleeing.

[Gettin tf outta dodge]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) slicked his hair back, to uncover his ear. Almost believing that he&#39;s misheard them just now.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh. She&#39;s even becoming his Boss now? What&#39;s next? Did you wager years of each other&#39;s lifespans too?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Crazy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Almost, yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: He wagered being a slave or something.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) hadn&#39;t expected this turn of events to unfold. Meixun made a run for it! And a fast one too. Much too fast for her to keep up with even if she wanted. Though she didn&#39;t mind, he&#39;d have to come around sooner or later. 

<font color = white>&#34;Right. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be seein&#39; ya&#39;, Henchmen #1.&#34;</font> she called out as he disappeared out into the storm.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m gettin&#39; pretty tired though. All this winning at life as got me feeling exhausted!&#34;</font> she yawned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Well. Congratulations on the new Minion. I guess? 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Wild...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Thank you. I've got a good one, he's quite fast. I hadn't a clue.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (Uchiha can still learn Raiton right?)

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True, but it might be the debt-slave fear breaking his natural limiters.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) a few seconds would pass before the group would hear a loud <font size=+3> thud </font> outside the Uchiha Clan walls.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: If not? He's faster than me. Impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Owhhhhhhhhh....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wait-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) couldn&#39;t help but chuckle. She was aware of the direction he&#39;d ran into.

<font color = white>&#34;Well that&#39;s poetic.. I imagine he&#39;s standing right under my Clan&#39;s insignia right now... Ran from me, just for the world to show him who he belonged to anyhow.&#34;</font> she mused at the idea.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Why did you call him Henchman number one? Are you planning to get more?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: ---
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's messed up man.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Classmates are friends, Reilin. Not property.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Never bet high, Hideo. Never bet high.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: It's not abuse. He can't gamble anymore now.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nuh-uh, learned my lesson. The universe doesn't want me to gamble anymore.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: He can gamble.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well- not avoid. But not worry about.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Shooting for Jounin? Ambitious.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: He mentioned it during the uh... class.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ahh. I might've missed that bit.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It was uh, hard to pay attention to yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: For sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Lot of moving parts...

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I plan to learn some Ninjutsu. Raiton, probably.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Throwing and raiton huh? Good combo, I think.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Doton and Katon, just like dad and Himeki.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I might study some taijutsu later too. Not sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Or throwing stuff. All good choices...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Mm. Never a bad idea to dabble.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Maybe. How about you, Papiyas? Given your future any thought?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: I know you have your Kenjutsu... but will you branch out?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm not sure I'd call us a duo though.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I second that. Finding suitable squadmates demands a bit more thought.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Not that I don't like you Katora- You're cool. Weird, but cool. But yeah it takes a lot more thought than us just being the two guys who have an idea.
