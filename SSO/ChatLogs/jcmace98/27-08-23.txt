<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) Ishikamaru's venture across Amegakure wasn't as fruitful as he thought it'd be. Truthfully, he was expecting to see utter chaos -- maybe due to his chaotic natureat heart. Though stoic in the visage, the lad tended to ponder on the idea of--

Nevermind.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) Nodding to each as they introduced themselves he pulled out three scrolls and handed them to each student. He then took a fourth one out and revealed the information inside it.

<font color = white>&#34;These are signup scrolls. Please fill these out and have your parents sign them then bring them back. If you do not have parents then sign the second line that states so.&#34;</font>

He points to each section

<font color = white>&#34;The first section is simple. Just your name, age, eye color basic descriptors. The second section goes over what you will be doing while at the academy. The third section is a waiver that states any harm recieved during training courses is not to be used against the academy. The fourth section states that this course is made to raise shinobi of the village and what that entails.&#34;</font>

He smiles once again and rolls the scroll up.

<font color = white>&#34;Feel free to fill these out in your spare time but know that school starts soon so don&#39;t take too long.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nods his head as he grabs scroll from the instructor. He could read just enough but it&#39;s not like he truly understood what many of it meant, but he was told enough.

<font color = white>&#34;Great! Signing up!&#34;</font> He bit his forefinger before writing his information down on the scroll. Just the basics as asked.

Name: Yoru
Age: 12
Doing: Learning!

He held his hand out for Shion to grab it back.</font></font></font>

-Yoshimitsu, 15.- 

Took him a bit to think over the doing part, was it asking him what he wanted to train in? He would stop and ask.

<font color = white>&#34;Umm, for this doing part is like what we aiming to learn?&#34;</font> He asked.</font></font></font>

-Taijutsu/Kenjutsu-

The male would finish up with how he looks and then sign his name. After which he would turn the paper in.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) takes the scroll from yoru and smiles.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) tosses the scroll back to the chuunin. If he had paid attention, he would have noticed Tajin did not bring out any writing utensils thus leaving the scroll blank.

<font color = white>&#34;Yokai, Tajin. Twelve years old and I plan doing whatever is needed most of in the village.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) kept his eyes closed while Yoru spoke, <font color = white>&#34;I am definitely training.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) laughs as he puts his hands on his hips and strikes a pose. His family was pretty well known!

<font color = white>&#34;Not me, but my family!&#34;</font> He turned a few times to give a good view of his... fairly normal looks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) just stares at Yoru, his eyes blinking a few times. He would adjust his mask to sit more comfortably on his nose.

<font color = white>&#34;I have no clue what you are talking about?&#34;</font>, he says, before turning his attention to Ishi.

He would hold a few fingers behind his back. 

<font color = white>&#34;How many fingers am I holding up?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re... joking... right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) ponders on it for a while before speaking up.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, he is someone who using his family to act like he is strong&#34;</font> He said with a snap of his finger as if he guessed it right.

<font color = white>&#34;I think that is why, he talks like that. Makes sense now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: I-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) took emotional damage as he paused in shock. The youth wasn&#39;t wrong. He himself wasn&#39;t strong yet... at least not by most people standards... He was just a fledgling, no not even a fledglng yet.

<font color = white>&#34;Y-you&#39;re... wrong! I&#39;m...&#34;</font> his voice got quieter near the end and started to trail off. How would he even respond to such a response? </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That I did. Met the client and now I have some ryo. I think I will go and purchase a knife with all this talk of crime.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled as he was spot on but no point in trashing someone for no real reason .
<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure you will get strong as time goes on.&#34;</font> He said leaving at that, with a bit of a smirk on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nodded spiritless. He wanted to be strong now! Not later...

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah... later on...&#34;</font> he sighed</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) supressed a yawn with the long sleeve of their kimono. <font color = white>&#34;Welll for now I will turn in.

<font color = white>&#34;Here you are children. Play with these, someone must be responsible around here.&#34;</font> a laugh escaped from the bandaged mouth as they dumped several spinning stars with sharpened edges out</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: it is not much. But if crime really is bad in the big village then that should at least discourage a common bandit.

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks, prey!&#34;</font> He shoved them into his pants irresponsibily.</font></font></font>

He examines it brilliant shine, his finger tracing the edges of the blade. A small speck of blood would begin to protrude from his finger, as the sharp edge sliced his soft flesh.

He would place the shuriken into his cowl pocket.

Her gaze remained fixed ahead, her eyes sweeping over the scene without a glimmer of interest. The chatter of the kids was a distant murmur, a background noise that held no sway over her thoughts.

Her features remained unchanged, her face an unmoving mask, as she walked closer to the group. Their voices rose and fell in a rhythm that didn't penetrate her consciousness. Shizuku's expressionless stare remained focused, her mind untouched by their words.

She was lost in a thick train of thought. Her mind set on her father's words and what they meant for her as a young Shinobi of a prominent clan. When the crowd was nearby, she stopped and fixated her stare on the people near her.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The kid&#39;s pinky flicks a bugger from out his nose then after, he rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

 <font color = white>&#34;Hehehe, yeah! My papa said you have to kill the prey, always!&#34;</font> He shouted.
