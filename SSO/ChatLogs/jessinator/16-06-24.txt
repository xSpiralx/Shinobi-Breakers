The girl&#39;s eyes fall upon a very brightly colored individual in the distance. Her gait slowed to a walk as she drew closer to the individual.

Her hands rested at either side as an attempt was made to more closely examine what intricate details were present.

<font color = white>&#34;...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) glances up to the individual, no doubt a shinobi in rights. He expected more to be joining in. A raspy and eerie voice breaks from his vocal cords, as if messed with to an extreme degree.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) tilted her head towards the scientist. She also noticed the plathora of headbands that lined the walkways behind him. Something was seriously off about this individual. The way he spoke...his movements and his overall vibe. 

<font color = white>&#34;Uhm...yeah I am.&#34;</font> the girl lied, hoping that giving off the illusion of her being more competent than a simple academy student might thwart off the threat of an attack.

<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) arrives at the scene and immediately drops down to the water below. His eyes change shape, the veins in his eyes becoming more pronounced. Even as he remained out of sight, he kept the scene above him in examination.

This was the perfect chance to get information on the enemy and the strenght of the new students, he seemed prepared to dash through the bridge itself with his pure muscular body at any opportunity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) arrives to the area. He stayed behind and simply observed. It had to be serious to warrant backup.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) seemed to be <b><i>very different</b></i> upon close examination. Organs in the wrong places, a chakra system that would make no sense and bursted with activity. Reserves massive in size, with a strange aura that couldn’t be placed correctly with what knowledge lay in hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I repesent the Dakuteika, before me are some...items we <i>procured</i>. And also a warning.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to be put off by the figure's strange innards and is immediate in his change of tactics. He sneaks around from underneath, trying to jump out from behind him to pincer the man.

He stops just before jumping out as other people react.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) lets her instincts take over and hops back a few meters, growning the distance between her and the alleged intruder once again.

What could she do? The higher ups were present, she had no weapons..

Instead she just focused her self on what she could do.. Scrutinizing the indivudal from top to bottom, her eagle eyes keenly locking onto any unsual properties or hidden gimicks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look and begin to read the indivitual&#39;s lips,he was not chakra sensitive so he cannot feel any disturbance,but it was clear this guy was not good news.

<font color = white>&#34;Young bodies...but for what.&#34;</font>He will ask,while somewhat trying to think why they needed their bodies,a bodies of some beginer genins</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) &#39;s face twisted in disgust as he examined the strange scientist&#39;s figure and heard his words. &#39;The fuck?&#39; he thought. As his eyes scanned the blonde girl, he got a very uneasy feeling. He decided to take a defensive stance, just in case.

<font color = white>&#34;What the hell?&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) moving to get in front of the rest he would use himself as a shield to deflect any attacks coming.

<font color = white>&#34;Get back everyone.&#34;</font>

Seeing His partner go on the offensive he would do the same. Watching to make sure the students did not do anything risky he would prepare to use a jutus on the enemy if he moved to attack the students.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: What the heck is this?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as he took in the scene before him. The strange scientist with his unsettling presence and the scattered headbands spoke of a dangerous situation. His mind raced, assessing the potential threat and calculating his next move. Despite the scientist's eerie demeanor and the implied threat, Sogeki's stance remained firm and his expression unreadable, masking any fear or concern beneath a veneer of cold resolve.

He knew that action would be required, but for now, Sogeki chose to observe, gathering crucial information and waiting for the right moment to strike. His hand subtly moved towards a concealed weapon, prepared for any sudden developments. In the face of uncertainty and danger, Sogeki's instincts honed in, ready to protect himself and his comrades from whatever this mysterious threat might bring.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) stared at the scientist blankly for several moments, the unnerving intensity in his eyes making her deeply uncomfortable. There was a disturbing aura about him, a level of psychosis that was palpable and chilling.



     As a nervous tick, she ran her fingers through her golden locks while her gaze never wavered  as she regarded the bizarre individual who had just issued a dire warning.



<font color = white>&#34;So, let me get this straight,&#34;</font> she began, her tone laced with sarcasm and a hint of defiance. <font color = white>&#34;If we venture into the wilderness, you&#39;re planning to abduct us and transform us into some sort of grotesque and depraved creature such as yourself? Is that what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</font>

She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper,  ashs he  mockingly stated. <font color = white>&#34;Because if that&#39;s your idea of a threat, you might want to reconsider your approach.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) begins to shift and rattle. What seemed to be skin and bone was flipping and turning, to reveal a number of mechanisms. His back and arms twist and fold, and his body launches to the side with a number of mechanical creaks.

His head twists around in a three-hundred and sixty degree spiral before it swivels to face the two true Jonin. The body pieces separate and folding, allowing him to immediately slip out of the grasp of the incoming tackle.

<font color = white>&#34;We seek information, but not at the cost of warning. I’ve not come to attack, today, I’m nothing more than an embassy for words today&#34;</font>

The water off to the side begins to ripple, only noticeable by those with attuned senses or abilities such as a Byakugan. While another presence couldn’t be seen though, it could be felt. A chakra system very vaguely seen, almost as if invisible but not.

<font color = white>&#34;Power doesn’t lie in your village, it lies with us. Keep this...&#34;</font> he glances to the two Jonin, <font color = white>&#34;in mind, kids.&#34;</font> He begins to pull off, backing up from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;I bring your missing headbands as a gesture. Now, assuming you want to keep them and your lives, I think I’ll be going...&#34;</font> his beady, glass eyes, looking back and forth between the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;And if not, then we could all just...<b><i>go</b></i>&#34;</font> he begins to launch manically as he cast his eyes down to the bridge.

A bridge lined up with hundreds of explosive tags. <font color = white>&#34;If you catch my drift&#34;</font> one of the eyes winks. <font color = white>&#34;But you won’t have time to battle me and save them&#34;</font> A hand begins to form into a symbol, priming the tags but not setting them off.with only a matter of seconds at hand, would the perpetrator find battle? Or would the kids find rescue?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Shion! Protect!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) looked left, then right. Blinked a few times and quickly realized she was in a situaiton way above her pay grade.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhhh...oh SHIT! RUN!&#34;</font> she exclaimed before cartoonishly scamping northwards towards the end of the bridge before she was turned into a living firework.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) is an academy student for a week. He can't be killed..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) quickly scanned the area and took note of his colleagues. He felt an ominous presence but couldn&#39;t quite make it out. As one of the scientist&#39;s hands began forming a symbol, his heart dropped. For a split second, he felt frozen before his adrenaline dumped. <font color = white>&#34;We need to GO!&#34;</font> he said, trying to stir the others to action.</font></font></font>

His instincts kick in sharply. With a quick assessment of the surroundings and the looming danger, he darts to the side, his movements swift and agile as he attempts to evade the potential blast radius.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</font> Sogeki mutters under his breath, adrenaline coursing through him. He doesn&#39;t engage with the scientist directly, realizing the immediate need to prioritize the safety of himself and the others. His mind races with thoughts of escape routes and strategies to mitigate the imminent threat without escalating the situation further.

As he moves swiftly away from the danger zone, Sogeki&#39;s gaze flickers back towards the scientist and the assembled Jonin. His expression is a mix of frustration and determination, knowing that the situation has escalated beyond a mere confrontation. With a resolve to regroup and strategize further, he gestures urgently for the others to follow suit, seeking cover and safety from the unfolding chaos.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) jumps forward, placing himself behind the grotesque form before him, threatening to hurt the new generation of shinobi. The Hyuuga was a proud man, believing himself to be the strongest- but he was not foolhardy enough to assume he could both protect and attack at the same time.

In times like this, Matsu knew he could rely on the blessed vessel of the tailed beast. He relinquished all thought of defence and went on an immediate offence. He landing with a heavy thud, poised to attack.

A fraction of a second passed.

A large circle seemed to appear below him and the soon-to-be corpse. Before that very same second ended, Matsu had began a flurry of blows.

<font color = white>&#34;Juukenho!&#34;</font> He shouted, as he delivered two blows. Immediately he delivered 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64 blows! <font color = white>&#34;Hakka Hyaku Bijuhanaho!&#34;</font>

The attacker would rock the puppet’s pieces, only to find the deformed body of a young child inside - his fists now digging into a thin young sternum and lifeless corpse.

The body itself, blowing up once it had been breached. Leaving the attacking Hyuuga with moderate injuries from the resulting explosion.

Papers reign down from above after smoke clears - with a singular message <b><i>we are already here.</b></i> Each of the students just barely scraping by with nothing more than minor injuries as they’re protected from the resulting explosions by their commanders. 
After all that’s left - nothing but splinters and chunks of a young boy’s body remain. The hyuuga’s palms soaked in the child’s blood. A child of Amegakure - a Genin, no less.

The expert use of the water jutsu saved the students from most of the despair, with nothing but be try minor injuries as a result

His intention was to ram his head directly into the kid's mid-section, but at the last moment he saw the copy that had been made and pulled up.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) had failed to draw the bull&#39;s attention with her antics. She still looked and sounded like Yurei. A few more handseals are formed.

<font color = white>&#34;Make it charge into the mountain, or the rock. Or the tree. We need it to scramble it&#39;s own brains.&#34;</font> She said, sure that none of them knew any tricks that could actually hurt such a large animal. After she spoke, two more copies of Yurei appeared, though these lacked shadows. They made silly faces and did ridiculous things to try to draw the bull&#39;s ire.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) placed his multitude of hands in different pockets of his hoodie, walking up behind his albino kin.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello cousin.&#34;</font> he said cooly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Massive Bull(The restored one-Kristuria) OOCs: (dang nat 20)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) steps back. He didn&#39;t see the need to get too close to the beast as is. Still, seeing such a rage filled animal charge down his kin and them jump into action was rather interesting.

   <font color = white>&#34;Be careful, brother. It seems dangerous.&#34;</font>, he obviously stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [clone+henge
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was keeping its attention entirely on how the bull maneuvered, since it was an animal--obviously its signature wasn't to fluctuate as explicitly as a human's. Though the location bias helped exponentially. Meixun's brow furrows slightly, recognizing that it was attacking Yurei's signature. Meaning that it would be vulnerable to any sort of sudden attack by those who were willing to do so.

Despite his lack of direct interaction with the current situation... Meixun is wearing red... Crimson red.

A crimson red silk shirt, still glistening from the time he was partially submerged in the water--if the bull desired to attack anything red? Well.
But Meixun isn't aware of this mythos just yet, primarily due to his sensory form, he continues to mark the animal's movements, waiting for a moment of opportunity to arise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) In this moment the bull was drawn to the clones produced by the transformed girl. They...spoke to him in an unnatural way that beckoned him to them.

A sharp turn is made and an explosion of strength ensues as the raging beast charges directly towards the clone of the girl.

Upon reaching the clone the bull simply runs <u></u>right through it<u></u> and slams into the mountain with tremendous force just as the attempt to mount the animal was made. The impending shockwave forcefully dismounts Yure.

The bull; however, at this point is jarred by his collision with the mountain and takes no further action this turn.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) landed on the ground, chest eating the grass as he stained himself with the earth. He couldn&#39;t really believe what he was seeing, no way this was just a domesticated animal.
  It was something further beyond. The environment sustained damage, people ran, but by the looks of it the bull had been clocked by it&#39;s own explosive power.

 Hearing the words of his brother, he clenched the green blades of grass and took a stand.
  <font color = white>&#34;Feelin&#39; dizzy?&#34;</font>

  Yurei would run forwards to drive home a flying drop kick to the bull&#39;s face, just like he&#39;d read about in books.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt)  <font color = white>&#34;Yeah... they&#39;ve got this covered.&#34;</font>

He was not going to give that creature a chance to charge him. He remained within the tree&#39;s canopy, watching the others do with the bull as they pleased. It seems no one had the means to secure it, so violence was probably the only option. Its owner should have kept a tighter leash on their livestock. They have no right to complain. Not after their lack of precautions set this dangerous creature loose on the population&#39;s common folks.

From his spot in the tree, the Marksman pitched a palm-sized stone or two at the bull&#39;s crown, looking to disorient it further. He&#39;s skilled enough to avoid hitting anyone other than his target. Especially with the Bull sitting stationary. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Massive Bull(The restored one-Kristuria) OOCs: (Roll that drop kick for me big bro)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) had managed to lure the beast! She perfectly executed her plan, and the resounding thud and crash of stone and horn particulate that echoed through the park from its impact filled her with a sense of pride. However, Shuye knew that this was now beyond her abilities. She'd given what she could.

She tucked her hands into her kimono like a character on the victory screen as Yurei -- and potentially others-- went to deliver the knock out blow.

It seemed a rock might get there before anything else, though!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) gets clobbered by the rock as the drop kicking man found himself sailing past the bull and into the frail red eye'd boy. 

The bull was shortly thenafter subdued and returned to his ranch. Those who took part in the apprehension of the animal were duely rewarded.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) is flying directly towards the frail boy near the mountainside, the heroes music playing behind him slowly losing pitch, slowing, distorting into a loser's theme in-where he would only manage to cause chaos.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt the animal's chakra wane significantly, indicating the animal was properly bested. The boy comitted the feeling to memory--should something similar occur with someone of more active circumstances. Regardless of his participation; he felt his pocket become a slight bit fatter once the group was rewarded.

Staring at the boon, he walked over to his sister, handing her the majority. What does he need money for? He can't do much with it, that's Shuye's job anyhow.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) checked over her brother to make sure he was not hurt-- and, oh yeah, dispelled the illusion. Being a boy was weird. She received his gift, and nodded.

<font color = white>&#34;Exicting, dìdì?&#34;</font> She asked him. She touched her pocket to pull a rice candy, only to remember that their spill in the water would have surely ruined it. Oops.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) goes to hit the ground for cover, but is far too late. The kick landing square into his chest and plummeting him into the ground by surprise.

He had been daydreaming. <font color = white>&#34;Ahh! Watch it!&#34;</font> He manages to cry out before he eats dirt</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) already was munching on the soggy balls of sweetness before she even gave tijme to consider handing it to him. He nodded softly, pulling the connective stick from his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;.............&#34;</font> He was very obviously speaking, though atop of his already whispy voice and the fact that his mouth was full, it was unintelligible.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) takes hold of the cash loosely offered to him. He then falls into thought.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) lands on the ground and then stomps in around the boy&#39;s body to get closer to them.
  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I think I got caught up with the bull.&#34;</font> He said sincerely, aiming to help them up with a hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) grits through his teeth, but couldn’t hold no ill-will towards his fellow peer. His thin arm reaches up to take hold so he can be hoisted back up.

Afterwards he dusts himself off and bows towards the other. <font color = white>&#34;Ehhh...no harm done, really. Thanks for the lift up. I’m Kenzo of the Uchiha&#34;</font></font></font></font>

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Mugen, Yurei. Since that&#39;s handled I&#39;m gonna head back towards the north-eastern side of the village.&#34;</font> He stated before muttering something softly to himself.

  <font color = white>&#34;<i>What a way to meet someone. . .</i>&#34;</font></font></font></font>

  <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t go taking any notes from me then.&#34;</font> He said with a light smile of his eyes.
  <font color = white>&#34;You can be my friend, and my brother Raku&#39;s if he takes to you.&#34;</font> Yurei followed with a nod towards direction of the taciturn one.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) suddenly felt embarassed, her usually quiet brother quite loud and speaking in a tongue most of these people had never heard before. It was harsh, tonal. She looked to her brother, and the word she uttered is only one; easy to understand.

<font color = white>&#34;Mugen?&#34;</font>

She then turned toward Raku. <font color = white>&#34;--It&#39;s how we talk at home.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) nodded in confirmation, though Shuye's divided attention forced the boy to follow suit.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) rubbed his face.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) looked at the frail black-eyed boy with a suspicious glance. He shuffled away from the boy but began to eye him with curiosity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to Shuye and blinks rather absent mindedly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) raises his head to meet the other’s sight, with a curt nod after.

<font color = white>&#34;I, uh...just wanna say six arms is really cool. Bet you don’t ever have trouble grabbing anything huh?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) says: Boo and Zing..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) blinked alongside Raku, something he said tipped Shuye's nationalism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) looked down at his arms, taking them out of his hoodie and clenching his multiple fists and wiggling his fingers. A slight grin appeared on his face. He had to admit, it was a bit of a funny joke.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes... the Tsuchigumo are the most powerful force in Iwagakure!&#34;</font> the boy said with a serious tone but also the naivete of his age.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Eh em...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: The six arms are pretty useful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) couldn’t help but smile at that, he enjoyed the pride the lad had for his clan. He felt very similarly, though he was constantly scolded when he brought it up - many punishments later it was something he didn’t speak of too freely now.

<font color = white>&#34;Most powerful force, huh? I’d consider my family to be the same.&#34;</font> He felt conflicted - he wanted to show up the spider boy now....but he was also interested in his person.

<font color = white>&#34;Two powerful forces coming together down the road could make them unstoppable&#34;</font> His mind deciding the next course of words for him. After all, it would be important to make friends and allies.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6699>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) Kohana&#39;s eyes narrowed as she focused on the six-armed boy. Honestly? He terrified her, and she didn&#39;t hesitate to voice her thoughts.

<font color = white>&#34;Can you use all six arms to cook? That might be the best use for those extra limbs,&#34;</font> she remarked as she approached, extending her arms and awkwardly crossing them. She had no idea how to shake hands with a six-armed freak of nature.

<font color = white>&#34;What is your family?&#34;</font> She speaks to the frail kid. Her opinion of him? His family must abuse, bully, beat, and belittle him.

<font color = white>&#34;With first glance, the umm...Six arms are better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) looks up to the kunoichi who walked over.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, hello, I’m a member of the Uchiha clan - but mostly privately tutored by my mother&#34;</font> She held strict discipline rules ever since losing their father in the war. Just hints of it would be strewn about with the way he acted - shy and mostly meek.

There was another side to him, though. One that was starting to pull while he spoke with his newly acquired Tsuchigomo er...friend? Enemy? It still remained to be seen. The little boy starting to grow into himself bit-by-bit the more he would open up.

<font color = white>&#34;I’m Kenzo, what about you and your family?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) rose an eyebrow as the thoughtful girl joined the conversation. He was feeling uneasy being surrounded by a couple of two armers. They were... different. 

<i>Cooking?!? The Tsuchigumo were warriors!</i>

But before he responded, he was distracted by Kenzo's response. 

<i>Uchiha</i>

Yes... the Uchiha were a formidable clan indeed. The blood that ran through their veins was strong. But certainly not as strong and pure as the blood of the spider.

All of that being said, Okuno was intrigued.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (sorry got pulled away for a sec)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) pauses as she turns to stare at the boy with six arms and raises three of her own to wave.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) tugs at Shuye&#39;s sleeve once more, it&#39;s been decided amongst himself that it&#39;d be best if Shuye understood what he did. After all, she&#39;s known best for a while by now, it would just be in bad faith to keep his thoughts to his own.

<font color = white>&#34;....Huigui muqin de linghun yexu shi keneng de maamaa?&#34;</font> His words were a knife, not helping by the overbearing and visceral tone which surfaces as Meixun&#39;s neutral state.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6699>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) Kohana stares at the freak...

<font color = white>&#34;Awkward...&#34;</font> Her hand retreats!

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah....&#34;</font> The rejection did not happen if she did not adknowledge it!

Kohana nods respectfully to both, her movements precise and controlled. She introduces herself with the utmost grace, a testament to the strict discipline she has endured from her own mother. However, again not as bad as it seems this Uchiha&#39;s mother treats her own.
<font color = white>&#34;A&#39;lass I am not of noble blood as you both. I am Hoshino, Kohana.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (misread your RP about crossing your arms. whoopsies. we'll roll with it)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) glanced at the retreating hands of Kohana. Perhaps she should be bowing to their noble blood instead?

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to recognize our families. I am Tsuchigumo, Okuno&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) bows with respect in response towards Kohana, remembering to keep his manners about him at all times. It didn’t matter who a person was, as holding respect to everyone would find you your own. At least that’s how he’d seen it.

He was careful though, not to see his mother about. It was late, but there was no telling when she would be out looking for him. If she woke, eventually she would come to find him.

A respectful bow to Okuno as well, as he directs to the both of them. <font color = white>&#34;Well met. Have you guys heard much about what to expect as Genin?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: The jonin I would assume.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) points to himself when addressing the somber-looking girl.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed to rouse out of a stupor. His words send a coursing torrent of anger through her. Not at him. It&#39;s at what he brings up. It&#39;s one of the things in her life that made her who she was; that loss. That absence. It&#39;d filled her with the need to take up that role as best as she could, along with the role she already had of being an elder sister.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;</font> She answered, in the more common tongue. <font color = white>&#34;I hope not. I hope she has moved on.&#34;</font> It was a mature take. One whose sincerity she struggled to actually hold. She missed her. It was hard to wish well on what you didn&#39;t want to lose when it slipped through your grasp. She almost left it at that, before remembering who she was talking to.

<font color = white>&#34;But if she hasn&#39;t, then you will find her.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) bows to his fellow Uchiha, <font color = white>&#34;I also expected the rest of our clan was snoozing. I don’t think we’ve met before now?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) let out a sigh. He would indulge the cooking question.

<font color = white>&#34;I think if I tried I could make the meanest and most angry stir fry ever cooked! The timing of all the ingredients could be absolutely perfect with all of these arms.&#34;</font> he said, gesturing all of his appendages... eh em... arms... around.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (That's the second Tsuchigumo including me.  Which means there's still 3 more to come.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) folded her arms before chuckling. She looked toward Kenzo and could appreciate how formal he was. Though she didn&#39;t reciprocate the action. It was clear she was a bit more rough around the edges than him.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll be Genin soon. Then we can do whatever tha&#39; heck we want... &#39;least I will.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) turned around to his cousin Tsuneko, shrugging slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Wow, that sounds amazing!&#34;</font> she exclaimed, her tone filled with genuine enthusiasm. Perfectly timed ingredients in a stir fry? You could become the ultimate chef! We could franchise my parents&#39; restaurant and become disgustingly rich!&#34;</font></font></font>

It's a good thing he's so well attuned to this feeling, because, well--he's completely null to the more explicit physicality of emotional states.

He doesn't know that she's only affirming him to quell his prodding, though he accepts her answer nonetheless. He remains the hug for a while, not letting her loose until he feels her signature relax a slight bit. Until then, a silent embrace is all he can provide.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: Indeed. I can feel the ryo already. But first I have to figure out this genin thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) returned the hug, wrapping both arms arouind the smaller boy for a long while.

The Marksman in Training eyes Hideo, who was at the head of the pack, rounding the corner already. 

<font color = white>&#34;So swift today, Hideo. You&#39;re putting all that experience from the last test to good use. Now. How are those reflexes?&#34;</font> 

There&#39;s a water-logged sack of practice kunai beside him. Wooden in make. Blunt and unlikely to truly cause any serious injury. But. They were aerodynamic all the same in his hands, even with the added weight-factor from absorbing water. 

He loosed a pair.
Two wooden, rounded points, streaking right for Hideo&#39;s knee-pits.

[2x Wooden Practice Kunai at Hideo. Gonna use Kunai stats for them for combat practice&#39;s sake. So C- Accuracy. Feel free to try defending or clashing with a rock, if you&#39;re built to manage that. ]</font></font></font>
