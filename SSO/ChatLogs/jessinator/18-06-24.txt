<font color = white>&#34;Hi guys!&#34;</font> He greets the group, not sure if anything was going on as of yet.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana couldn&#39;t quite make sense of Venturo&#39;s story. To her, it was just a rock. However, her curiosity got the better of her, and she couldn&#39;t help but ask one thing.

<font color = white>&#34;Venturo, do you -only- give these rocks to girls?&#34;</font> she asked, a mischievous tone in her voice. <font color = white>&#34;Are you, perhaps, what they call a serial... romance seeker? If so, I believe we have therapists for that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Though he&#39;s far too stupid and oblivious otherwise to understand the hidden contexts of what she&#39;s asking, he responds almost <i>too</i> quickly.

<font color = white>&#34;Nope. I&#39;d give rocks to the guys too, but besides Hideo I haven&#39;t really gotten to talk to many, and sometimes I.. don&#39;t have the rocks on me for everybody.&#34;</font> Then, he does a little bit of pondering on it some as well; curious himself about one thing in particular.

<font color = white>&#34;... Do you not like yours?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Not really. No.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: Why not?

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Why would you do that, that's a treasure from our meeting!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Is it not my property now?
