<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) walked up to the volunteer and adopted a fighting stance. He looked ready to deliver the Hyuuga's famous open palm blows. He pulled his right back back at the hip level, building momentum. However, instead of an open palm, he curled his fingers forwards resembling a grasping motion.

To those looking at his hand, they would see each finger glow a menacingly purple color in turn - starting with the pinky. In a swift strike, he would slam the fingers into the Hoshigaki's middle.

The blow did not seem to hurt the boy, he could feel something was OFF about him.</font></font></font>

In the back of the Satetsu mind, the thought of the hunt still lingers. He pays close attention, refusing to allow anyone that isn&#39;t on the list too close.

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: That is the best way to be nice to one another. We train, spar and grow with one another.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: We learn each other habits.. then we dominate and eliminate any and all krakens.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Everyone's all edgy and weird.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Although being a kraken sounds kind of cool.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Not about being edgy. At least I don't consider myself that. I just don't like people that sit around and act like we're not more than just kids playing ninja.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I just don't train ALL the time, jerk.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: So
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: You're complaining about us wanting to fight. So that implies that, even if you do train, it's the bare minimum. You're judging us for doing what we wish to do.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Najiro I heard you were having a duel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Part of being a ninja is knowing your friends, as more than just fighting machines.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: What better way to bond that battle and converse?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: You act like conversations dont happen prior, during, and post spar.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How about starting with a conversation? The first thing you said was let's fight.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not going to explain basic manners to a meat head.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: So you're angry about my conversation starter?

<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Have you decided yet?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Then what is your issue?
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: I already know who they have
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will fight you in one weeks time.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm working on a new technique.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Right now, you'd probably beat me, so it's a waste of both of our time.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I'm simply trying to understand your logic. Throwing hands isn't necessary. But I accept the challenge.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: Najiro i'll fight on your side if you'll have me
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: You said that all we do is fight, I say that fighting is our way to bond. Then you said we don't even converse prior to battle, I said we converse before, during, and after.. So what exactly is your issue with folks that actually like to hone their skills through consistent sparring?
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: If you're not doing it, don't expect others
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: That's why people have teams
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I as well, Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: If we go into battle, its a stronger motivator to know and care for the person beside you.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm...sure Chizu.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Najiro do you need throwing weapons at all?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I don't know your hopes, your dreams, or aspirations. I barely know your name, yet we expect to operate as cohesive units when we face our enemies.

<font color = white>&#34;I..I just don&#39;t want to see any of you die because we focused so much on fighting that we forget we are people.

A brief twist of movement could be noted; and she vanished into a blinding blur of immense speed and raw agility. She appeared directly before him, and looked down towards him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You do, yes,&#34;</font>

A fist was launched directly towards his stomach - she didn&#39;t care about the back-talk but this man has ushered forth something previously, and she had to repay the kind for what he had done. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You threw a rock at my cat,&#34;</font>

She then drew her fist back, and simply moved to let him fall accordingly.

Without hesitation he reacts by headbutt=ing his head in to the fist to take on even greater force of the strike.
(Damage Cap raised to Critical)

Sending himself flying back off the contact and then splashing in to the water. A familiar sensation. Though last time he enjoyed flying higher in the air. For a moment he was under the water and eventually surfaced.

His pair of shirts was missing and he lacked shoes. Quite literally punched right out of his clothing.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh. The PAIN!&#34;</font>
Gripping his chest as many tears began to shed. Now floating on top of the water as he swayed around at its will.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font>

He would then simply jump into the water, swimming over to the injured boy and grabbing him by his underarms, then proceeding to use a half back stroke to swim back to the edge of the water and pull both himself and the boy out of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp... Anybody wanna take him to the hospital?&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t seem too thrilled on the aspect of transporting blast to the hospital so he hoped somebody else could do it.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;They&#39;ll put me further in to the system. Can&#39;t have that.&#34;</font>
Grabbing hold of that thread a bit tighter and forcing himself to withstand the crucial pain from the recent assault.

<font color = white>&#34;You are a good guy. Stay that way.&#34;</font>
Giving him a thumbs up along with a smile that went with it.

He would return the thumbs up and then look around for the boy&#39;s clothes which may have ended up being washed away in the water.

<font color = white>&#34;So you need clothes because you are cold? I see.. so functionality over design..?&#34;</font> he mumbles as he takes some notes.
It was clear that if someone wished to convey their words, then they would either need to shout or talk fro REALLY close.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) taps his notebook as he waits for more feedback on the idea of purchasing fashion clothings. <font color = white>&#34;Anyone else wants to share their opinion?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) put away the notebook as he realized that none of the kids had an opinion to share.. either because they were shy, or because they didn&#39;t know the true value of being dripped the fuck out.
<font color = white>&#34;Seems like it might be too early for questions.. I&#39;ll come back later. Be a darling Sha-chan, and ask your young friends if they would be interested in the prospect of purchasing designer clothes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Ohoh.. yes, Donut is quite the handsome donkey. He has a few mares back at home

Whilst it could be admitted that he <b>was indeed cool looking..</b> and carried a aura of <b>swagger</b>. A job was a job, and hence, a order is an order.

That smirk creaked, and if his face wasn&#39;t normal? It would slide right past the boundaries of reality, and bend it to his whims. It AURA was that potent; and slowly he eased a half-step back. 

A single foot in front of the other, and he curved his knee slightly. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Wait, you think I&#39;m weak?! I&#39;m Ito of the Takeshi Family! I run this shit, I&#39;m the boss, the don, and all that comes with it - you could even call me the Chairma-,&#34;</font>

The latch atop his poncho was undid swiftly. The poncho itself being cast aside as his own stylish blue threads were showcased in full. 

Hitting the pose akin of Hikari, the boy would enter a stance. A stance ready for any and everything that could be thrown at him.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mon then, from one fashion icon to another, I won&#39;t damage yer threads <i>too</i> much..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) had already formed his stance; it was an oddity akin to more of a weird disco-posture as compared to actual combat but alas it was his style, don&#39;t judge, and be rude to the idiot. 

A grumble formed, and suddenly a a shimmering hilt of metal could be spotted coiled to his hip as he rolled his hand down admist a hilt so that he could draw what appeared to be a Katana!

Oh shit! It was actually more or less a generic-looking, and mass produced replica but alas to those Students? It looked like the greatest thing ever made, a shimmering tone of steel - gems, jewels, and a badass looking shark-skin felted tassel. 

This thing was cool. 

   <font color = white>&#34;WAHHHHHH-HA!,&#34;</font>

He quickly rushed forward - the battle had begun, a battle of immense and god-like strength would quickly unfol...wait a fucking minute?! A sudden THUD could be noted, and the man found himself quickly face-planted into the freshly paved bridge. 

Grumble...grumble.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) smirked. He had managed to land a solid blow against one; if it wasn&#39;t for the fact his head was currently screaming at him he could have added more back into that blow. 

He was starting to get himself into an adjustment; and as they all motioned to surround him and thus engage him once more? He was ready; a brief flash of movement, and he twisted about nearing a half-step leap upwards. 

Those blows creaked along below him. Those arms attempting to grasp him, and those Shuriken seemly curved along. They were about to crash into each other, and that simply aided him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Oh?! Its time to put my back into it!,&#34;</font>

A shift of his body; he was floating albeit briefly - the world coaxed into a near halt, and suddenly he dropped his arm forth and the length of steel seemed to coax along the air. 

A brief eruption of sparks fluttering into view, and suddenly an explosion of intense HEAT! OH MY WHAT WAS THIS?! He was starting to glow; an AURA began to flare up. He had begun to build up his HEAT BAR!

   <font color = white>&#34;OHHHHH YAH! ITO STYLE SUPER INTENSE FLAME CUT!,&#34;</font>

That heat erupted into a brief X along the ground, and then BOOM! He landed nearby.
