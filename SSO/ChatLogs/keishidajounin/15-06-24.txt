<font color = white>&#34;What are those for?&#34;</font> he&#39;d ask as he whispered underneath his breath. Were they the new unifor he and many of his peers were going to be forced to enroll in? 

No further announcements were made, so instead of drawing closer into the swarm of people - the boy would remain silent and carefully observe his surrounding. Surely he&#39;d encounter someone worth wild</font></font></font>

Crossing his arms, the boy&#39;s eyes begun to grow heavier with each passing hour. 

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder if they&#39;re going to make us wear uniforms, I doubt they&#39;ll have my size&#34;</font>

His words would too faint to be heard outside of his immediate area. As the wind be to howl, a reminder had been triggered within his head. Pushing off the bark off the tree, He&#39;d wonder if everyone pressent was also hear for the early enrollment. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked.

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm?,&#34;</font>

She stared at him for the moment; and just continued to stare at him for a good few seconds before she even considered speaking. 

   <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t have any Kunai, no - I would speak to the others which I am sure happen to be around here somewhere,&#34;</font>

She shrugged. 

   <font color = white>&#34;And the uniforms? I really have no knowledge on, again I&#39;d ask the others - I tend to avoid the paperwork,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
