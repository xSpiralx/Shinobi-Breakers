<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) Asa had his pinky dug into his ear, relieving an itch that had been bothering him. <font color = white>&#34;Hm?&#34;</font> He turned to meet Sogeki&#39;s stare. Electric as it was, Asa wasn&#39;t one to be easily intimidated. As he listened, his mouth broke into a toothy grin.

<font color = white>&#34;What? Is your ego so fragile that words hurt it?&#34;</font> He said with his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Of course I have the guts to say it to your face. I&#39;m right here saying it, after all. If you were even the slightest bit competent, you wouldn&#39;t allow the contestants to back out.&#34;</font> The aura between them was electric and it was clear their egos were clashing.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not afraid of speaking my mind.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Or of you, for that matter.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s gaze intensifies as he listens to Asa&#39;s bold words, a flicker of respect for the stern boy&#39;s courage flashing across his features. Despite his irritation, Sogeki admires the audacity of someone willing to confront him head-on.

<font color = white>&#34;Words don&#39;t hurt me, Asa,&#34;</font> Sogeki retorts with a smirk, his voice steady and confident. <font color = white>&#34;But disrespect gets noticed. If you think I&#39;m incompetent, then show me in the tournament. That&#39;s where it counts.&#34;</font>

He steps closer, the tension palpable between them as their egos clash in the arena of words. <font color = white>&#34;You speak your mind, I get it,&#34;</font> Sogeki continues, his tone firm. <font color = white>&#34;But speaking and proving are two different things. You want to checkmate? You better make sure you can back it up.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s eyes gleam with a challenge as he meets Asa&#39;s gaze squarely, neither backing down nor conceding ground. The air crackles with rivalry, each asserting their stance with unwavering determination.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) rolled his shoulders back and rubbed his right hand along the side of his neck.<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll rise to the challenge. Name the time and place.&#34;</font> Asa walked forward and to Sogeki&#39;s side. <font color = white>&#34;If you feel direspected, then so be it. I have no intention to challenge your perspective.&#34;</font> 

He began walking past the boy, to the sound of the bells. <font color = white>&#34;However, know this. I strive to be the best. Whether I win or lose, it only strengthens my resolve. So, in the end, I still win.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;If my desire for those around me to do better comes off as disrespectful, let it...&#34;</font>

With that, he was off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) asks: Your not cold, little girl?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Admin(The restored one-Kristuria) OOCs: (Oh aye i'm not here ic LOL)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Admin(The restored one-Kristuria) OOCs: (my b)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki watches Asa walk away, his expression unreadable as he absorbs the stern boy's words. There's a flicker of grudging respect in Sogeki's eyes, though he maintains his stoic demeanor.

Asa's challenge lingers in the air, and Sogeki silently acknowledges the seriousness of his resolve. He watches Asa depart, the sound of bells fading into the distance.

With a determined expression, Sogeki shifts his focus back to his own preparations for the tournament, his mind already planning his strategies and tactics. The rivalry with Asa adds another layer of motivation for Sogeki, pushing him to sharpen his skills and prove himself in the upcoming competition.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) continued working on his craft. Playing around with the a set of wooden senbons.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) says: These should work
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) moved towards the village's monument where he would soon take a seat, there he would begin shaving the edges of a branch to produce a series of weapons.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) attention continued to focus on his ability, playing with the fell of the wooden tools bending at his will as it shuffle around his fingers like a pen, weaving around them effortlessly. <font color = white>&#34;This silence is starting to get to me.&#34;</font> he&#39;d mutter as he continued on. I&#39;m pretty certain there should be some guards patrolling the area or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) was beginning to feel like a prisoner in the village, there didn't seem to be a chance of him exploring the outter walls as of lately.</font></font></font>
