<br><font color=green>*Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) says: Oh brother, this is taking longer than explected.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) push off the bench and begain exploring the grounds with hopes of running into someone worth exchanging names if not fists with.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) looks at the non-bladed boy.
<font color = white>&#34;He has a lot of hair. Boy needs a haircut forreal.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Keishi has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Where are your shoes, child?
<br><font color=green>*Keishi (The bladed boy-Keishi da Jounin) says: Hmm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) glanced down at her feet. While she didn&#39;t wear traditional &#39;shoes&#39;, there were several wraps that kept her soles from constantly touching the ground.

     <font color = white>&#34;These&#39;re good enough. Don&#39;t want to waste ryo on something I&#39;m going to mess up a lot..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Waste ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Are you poor?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Nah. Just would rather spend that money on other things.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Its not a big deal, is it?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If I were to invite you into my office, you would drag dirt everywhere with your unwashed, scummed feet.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your task will be to take someone's shoes. Forcefully.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Failure to do so will result in punishment from myself.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) tapped a finger against her cheek. Not once did the youth consider the &#39;downsides&#39; of her lack of proper footwear. Then again, she never really imagined herself walking into someone&#39;s office. Dirt could always be cleaned, couldn&#39;t it?

     <font color = white>&#34;Well...&#34;</font>

She paused, her eyes scanning the adult. It was the <i>third</i> time someone above her age gave her a command. While the other two resulted in a reward, this one.. It seemed like she didn&#39;t really have a choice. It wasn&#39;t like her to go against the wishes of elder shinobi.

<font color = white>&#34;That sounds kind of easy.&#34;</font> she comments.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) settles both arms behind his back and observes the girl with a scrutinizing glare. <font color = white>&#34;If you make it so,&#34;</font> he starts and pivots to scan the surrounding area, <font color = white>&#34;What is your name? I must make note.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Tsukiko.&#34;</font> she responds plainly. She turns her head, her eyes also glancing about the small gathering of people. Unrecognizable villagers. Passerbys..

But then her eyes catch wind of a certain unmistakable individual.

     <font color = white>&#34;Hey. Short stuff!&#34;</font> she calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) begins a slow departure. <font color = white>&#34;As you were then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ..Of course he falls asleep.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: Hey. Kid. You awake over there?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ...Jeez. You'd think this is the Hidden Blanket village or something.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pauses. A finger juts out towards the reserved one on the bench.

     <font color = white>&#34;Hey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns her hand. She flexes the fingers to make a &#39;gimme&#39; gesture.

     <font color = white>&#34;Your shoes. I need &#39;em.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) pulled off the shoes and toss them into the waterway.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) gestures a hand toward the blue-skinned boy. <font color = white>&#34;Beat him. You may take his shoes too.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) yells: ...?!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) yells: Don't be fooled.. This is a test.. He'll slap you too...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) looked confused as he manage to fall into a daze. <font color = white>&#34;Oh no this time of day the current isn&#39;t strung.&#34;</font> he replied.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) diverts her attention from the now shoeless reserved youth. Her eyes rest on the blue-skinned boy, primarily towards the shoes he adorns.

     <font color = white>&#34;..You ready?&#34;</font> she inquires.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) jumped up to face the stature of the crimson-haired vet and gave a salute. <font color = white>&#34;Eh... good day sir!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) keeps his hands behind his back and steps away to the side. <font color = white>&#34;You may begin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) sprinted forward towards the hoshigaki while launching a senbon toothpick in his direction. Hopefully it was enough to throw him off-guard as he begun his assault.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) pivots and turns away to depart. He leaves them to their devices. <font color = white>&#34;The blue one is not allowed to fight back. Do not break his bones. We need to keep our soldiers in shape. Stop the fight when he draws blood.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
