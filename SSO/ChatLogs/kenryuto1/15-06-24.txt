<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) stood by the willow tree with arms crossed. His eyes would glare off in the distance periodically as he noticed more poeple were beginning to populate the market place. Oddly, he&#39;d take notice of a series of uniforms being layed out along the ground. 

<font color = white>&#34;What are those for?&#34;</font> he&#39;d ask as he whispered underneath his breath. Were they the new unifor he and many of his peers were going to be forced to enroll in? 

No further announcements were made, so instead of drawing closer into the swarm of people - the boy would remain silent and carefully observe his surrounding. Surely he&#39;d encounter someone worth wild</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Hey 
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: How are you?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Hello there!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (lol i think your shoes look fine)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) leans back, both his palms against the bench. He looks to his right as the stranger made conversation, his eyes seemed to lack an iris. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m doing alright! Just taking a short break from my run, how about yourself?&#34;</font> He asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I'm not doing anything but thinking. It's my favorite hobby.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: How about a new hobby? You could train your body instead!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) chuckled to himself about what he had said like he did almost every time he said it. 

<font color = white>&#34;Train?&#34;</font> he uttered before turning his head to face the pale-eyed martial artist. 
<font color = white>&#34;I guess it is but I never see it as training. I just think that thinking is fun and nobody talks about it. Running and exercise aren&#39;t as fun to me. Sorry.&#34;</font> he said. <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your name by the way?&#34;</font> he asked</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) smirked to his response, taking his palms off the bench. He formed a T shape with his arms and began to stretch slowly, straining his muscles. <font color = white>&#34;Name&#39;s Matsu. Hyuuga, Matsu.&#34;</font>

The man who was clearly in his late 20&#39;s added, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the Head of the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: What brings you here?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) yells: Hrmm... I just got tired of sitting down near the edges of the village. Plus my water bottle needs a refill!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: ... And where are you refilliong it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) scratched the back of her head slowly. Glancing left and right slowly with a sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Anywhere with water, of course..!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed with much conviction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: Hm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) continued to stretch, switching arms now, <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your name, little one?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) looked over at the older man and tilted her head slightly. <font color = white>&#34;Yukigetsu, sir.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Greetings Yukigetsu! I am Matsu Hyuuga!
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Tenjin has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: I'll be one of your instructors this year if you're in the academy.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) says: Woah, the Hyuuga clan? That explains it.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: I'm the head of the clan, yes/
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) says: I think 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Yukigetsu (The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) says: I Think I should be signed up, but maybe I forgot somehow...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) gives a deep and slow bow of respect towards his clan head, before taking a seat near by..

She flips her backpouch around and begins to fumble through some supplies.. In an disorganized and disheveled maner.

No words are spoken, only a pair of matte pale eyes that peek up ever so often.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Yukigetsu(The pale bleach-haired girl-Korxz) OOCs: (Ill logout for now. Will rp more 2morrow. Gnite.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (night)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (sorry give me a sec, playing OW)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) looks sideways to his fellow clan member, <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your name, young one?&#34;</font> He now stood from the bench and began to stretch out his legs.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) stops her rummaging through the pouch, zipping it closed once more and sliding it to the rear of her hip. 

<font color = white>&#34;Higane.. Master Matsu.&#34;</font> She replied with another soft bow of the head.

Respect, was indeed the name of the game.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (okay done with that)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Higane, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Are you enrolling in the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Yes M-master Matsu. I plan on making this year count.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: As I mentioned earlier to the youngsters, I will be one of your instructors this year!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Here, have these as a little pre-year studies!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Thats what I heard from my parents.. but I-I didn't believe it! This.. is soo coo---!...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Ahem.. thank you Master Matsu.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) reaches a hand into his open robes, and pulls out several small scrolls. He double checks he grabbed one of each before tossing them high into the air for the young Hyuuga to catch.</font></font></font>
<br>Hyuuga, Matsu is Hyuuga, Higane's new teacher for Henge no Jutsu
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) bows her head softly once again, accepting the scrolls sent her way.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: There's 2 more, but you'll get those a bit later when you have more experience moulding you chakra!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh.. this is alot of reading.. And yes Chakra control.. one of the things I was looking forward to learning more about.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) finishes stretching all him limbs and smiles widely as he looked around the square.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I'l do by due diligence and get these down to memory.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Have you awakened your Byakugan yet?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: ...Erm..is it okay to speak of this? --Apologies... You are our leader, if you say it, I will follow. No I have not.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: It's just my parents are more old school, ya know? They keep secrets.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I think my twin brother might have though... He's a genious compared to me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Worry not, for I am allowed to do whatever I like!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I am the strongest, and I am the best!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hello..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) turns his eyes to the newcomer, his pupil-less eyes finding him soon enough, <font color = white>&#34;Hey there!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: My brother is your biggest fan Master Matsu-- I mean not that I'm not---Er.. I mean.. Ahhh.... Hello there!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) awkwardly switches stance and faces the black haired male.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Sorry I closed the game by accident)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why are you fan of him?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Because!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He's the head of my fami-- 
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: oh i see
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) flexes his muscles, his open robes giving an easier view. <font color = white>&#34;I am Matsu Hyuuga! I am here to insure you guys get stronger at all cost!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: but sir,im not...strong
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) jumps into the air, doing several acrobatic spins mid-air. With a heavy THUD, he lands right in front of the boy. He leans forward, invading his personal space and looked down on him from his great height. <font color = white>&#34;We can fix that for sure! The way to get stronger is to train!&#34;</font>

He suddenly pulled back and took a small hop back, and began to shadow box, <font color = white>&#34;The thing about training is training more!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: W-well....i apperiate the offer,but  after the academy finish i want to be not a martial artist
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But a medical ninja.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Then I can teach you in that regard to!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Huh..Medicine?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Didn't know you were medic ninja too..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: This is also my area of interest, what a twist of fate.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) swiftly produces several sets of shurinken with a flick of his wrist. In the blink of an eye, however,  they disappear. <font color = white>&#34;I am not one! But one of your teachers will be! I can teach you how to wield tools!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh..i can do that..somewhat.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) takes a few steps towards the black haired male and brings her right hand to her chin, her left slowly taps at her hip. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Higane, whats your name? Maybe we will be classmates!&#34;</font>

The girls eyes seem to light up at the mention of the medical arts.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (higane do me a favor and try to teach him a jutsu, I want to see if same-rank teaching is enabled)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will reveal one of the practice shurikens,made out of wood rather than steel.He was practising with it for a while.especally due to how his control of chakra traning was going on.He needed more and more of it,yet he feelt quite weak compared to most</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (Negative.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Ah damn okay, I gotta do it myself)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Najiro.And most likely we will be.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Najiro.. It's a cool nam-- Erm.. Any family or clan name of relevance? Wait.. is that rude to ask?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) taps her chin a few times with her finger, before relaxing her posture once again.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yakushi clan.But its not big as the ones in this village,its more of a family than a clan name
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) does a somersault towards the young man and invades his personal space once more. He peers down on him, looking down at him with a menacing face. After a second or two of intense starring he breaks into a wide smile and places several scrolls in his hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Read these!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Yakushi, Najiro.. Got it! I'm pretty good with names and faces--Woah! Where does he keep em all!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at the white haired male afterwhich they gave him several scrolls.It seemed the contents to be what the academy should teach him,so it was definatly legal to be given these.

Whoever,he only worried if perhaps was too early,afterall,The year just started of his academy lessons.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh,thats the material we will need to learn.Thank you sir.&#34;</font>He will say as he saved them at his small bag.We will definatly learn them,but for now? he decided that he needed time to learn other stuff</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) smiles and puts a finger to his lips while winking at Higane. If she looked closely she could JUST make out some black markings on his chest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (DONT TEMPT ME FKER)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: That's only the first set! Once you master those and master your chakra more, come back for the other set!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Us higher ups have been asked to pass them around!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) was sharp, even without the awakening of her Byakugan, the young pre-teen was born with extremely sharp eyes capable of tracking even the most minute of details..

She easily picked up on the black markings that bore themselves on her Clan leaders chest. <font color = white>&#34;....Hmm.. Yeah. Chakra.&#34;</font> She ideled on as her vision split between the two individuals.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I see.Well,may i ask something?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (check mate)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (oh shit
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (They got eagle eyes)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) took a step back, granting the boy his personal space back. The Hyuuga coul make out Fuuinjutsu markings, with some Fuuinjutsu knowledge they could understand a bit more about it&#39;s purpose.

<font color = white>&#34;Ask away my boy!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Have you seen other students going around the town?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or everyone is asleep and is just me and her
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (I can't tell if it's Fuuin or Kaifu it falls under)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: Just you three! There was a fourth earlier but they seem to have gone to sleep.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Ah...what a shame
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) did not understand what the strange markings meant, but she took a mental note of them regardless before responding to her newly made acquantance. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve seen a few, here and there.. Ah yea, I&#39;m tired myself.. My brother might be around but he has more energy than I do.&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh I'm not a shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Or attempting to become one at the moment.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I find some ninja arts interesting though.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well..i want to be medical ninja
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Yes! That is one of the fields that interests me the most.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: When you learn medicine and become skilled would you be willing to show me a thing or two?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sure? though im still a academy student..there is a whole year of studying before im a real ninja

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...uh..okay
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Hey Najiro, what's your favorite hobby?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: hmm...studying?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Kinda why i want to be a medic
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh, That's pretty close to my favorite hobby. Cool
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: But you make it sound like medicine is the only thing people can study.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not really
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its just what i want to study.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh okay.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than that...i need to perfect my control...and do some stuff too
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) stood by the monument at the square, not entirely sure what she should be doing right now, except, perhaps, mingling with the other students.

Orange eyes scouted the area, noticing not one, but two people, likely students as well.

Slowly, her hand would raise, an informal greeting by means of waving at the two was made.
<font color = white>&#34;Hello, are you both students, as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im a student.I belive the person with me is not,well..atleast not very interested in the shinobi life
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand. And likely an understandable feeling as well. For some, at least.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Weird, second DC...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Sorry about that... ^^; )
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not that much of a figther too
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: My name is Najiro,and i hope to be a medical ninja in the near future.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I wonder why I keep DCing..)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) began to make a formal bow this time, as the wishful student introduced himself.
<font color = white>&#34;My name is Hanamura. To be quite honest, I have multiple ideas of what I&#39;d like to move into. I was thinking, perhaps, Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, either balancing it out or having a primary and secondary focus. But of course, I am just a student, so I still have much to learn before I could even begin focusing on something - Or so I&#39;d wager.&#34;</font>

Her hand gently covered her mouth, a soft chuckle escaping her before her hand lowered again.
<font color = white>&#34;But a Medical Shinobi... Quite a, how should I put it... A very important position, at the very least. I hope you succeed in your dream, and I am sure you will if you put your mind to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I really apologise for these DCs...I think my internet is acting up...)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah.Ive had some basic traning into shurikenjutsu too.So hopefully im not too bothering if i ever go to a mission
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its fine
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Practice makes perfect. But it is a good idea to learn how to defend yourself, and potentially others, especially when near or in enemy environments and areas.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Have you learned anything in the academy yet?
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Tenjin has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Reseted the router/modem whatever. ^^;;; Should be fixed now I hope.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (alright
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I guess no?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Pardon? No to what?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Have you learned anything in the academy yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: That was my question,but you seemed zone out for a second
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, apologies. I'm... I guess I was a bit tired, but I should be fine now. - As for having learned anything, besides some of the village's history, I don't think I know much yet.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: I wonder, though, has the Festival of Water begun yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I don't think it has begun
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Though..i hope it will begin sooner or later.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Excited for it?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Though i need to watch out aswell.On that day i need to have atleast few shirts and pants
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) giggles softly, nodding her head.
<font color = white>&#34;Getting hit by water, or just getting drenched by it, is a hundred percent possibility, for sure. Unless you&#39;re good at dodging or, maybe, hiding.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,im traning my speed outside of my control with chakra,so we will see
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Though,how about you? Are you ready to be hit with water?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I can take it, but I will drench any who drench me, twice as bad. -- Don't ask me how, because I've yet to figure that part out... But all in good fun, of course.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm....Also
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is few students besides us who are around,but they seem kinda...very hardly focused on their stuff
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (aka afk)
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Oh? As in, slacking?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Could be they're taking a breather, though... Maybe they've been studying all day and night.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe.I tried to talk with them but they seemed kinda..zoned out
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Hm? I definitely did just zone out.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: What did I miss?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, hello. Just some talk about the Festival of Water, and our plans for, well, training?  I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: well we talked about the festival of water
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Oh okay. What's your name miss?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) makes a formal bow once more.
<font color = white>&#34;Apologies. I am Hanamura, a pleasure to meet you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Tenjin. The pleasure's mine.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Are you interested in medicine too?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I would have to say no to Medicine, although I do find it impressive and important, I... Would likely be more on the front-lines and, per chance, the one needing medical attention.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) let out a soft, yet somewhat uncomfortable chuckle.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Well then you have found good luck in the form of the two men before you. Sounds like you should get to know Najiro well though since he will become one of the best medics.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) gave a few nods, smiling as she did so.
<font color = white>&#34;I am sure he will be, if his motivation holds and his dedication stands.
But, may I ask, from what I heared you, yourself, might not be as interested in training? Or did I missunderstand that?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I recently had it revealed to me by the head of the Hyuuga clan that I train more often than any academy student.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: My favorite things to do are think and imagine. He referred to those things as training the mind.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I will probably wind up making tools that you use. And he will probably wind up helping you recover.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh? So the opposite? Quite dedicated then? And I see... Well, if per chance you, either of you that is, are looking for a training partner, I would love to apply and offer to join in.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Oh? A Craftsman-in-Training, then? If I understand this well?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Yes. I like the way you speak. Always clarifying and checking for understanding is an intellectual virtue.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,if you will be craftsmen in the future,i will pay you a visit
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I have no doubt that you will. I will be the best around after all.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: As will I. And thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: In any case..what we gonna do for now?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Perhaps the two of you could train together right now.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: All three of us would benefit from that.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: e-eh? You sure?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Of course! 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: As in a sparring match? Or perhaps using tools, equipment, and the likes?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess as sparring parther.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: A match. Seeing what fights will look like will always help me.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: How can I make good tools when I don't know anything about the trade?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Can we contact an admin for set-ups yet? Or is everyone at least at 3/3 points? ^^)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) takes a seat on the ground with a huge grin on his face as he pulls out a notepad and a pen before watching the two of them with widened eyes of excitement.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (same XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i cannot find where was the rule about minimal range of char,so imma just say atm is 5 titles
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (That's fine!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (found it
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its 8 titles
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) inhaled deeply before letting out a long exhale.
Her stance would then be entered. It wasn&#39;t exactly anything out of the ordinary, it was pretty mild, inexperienced, but likely allowing more of a defensive movement than being more of an aggressive stance.

<font color = white>&#34;I am ready. But let&#39;s keep this as a training; No breaking limbs. I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to mention this, especially to someone educating themselves to be a medic, but, some people can get... Too into it, I guess?&#34;</font>

There she stood, ready to begin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I see..at any case,im ready
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Yay! Position Markers. No need for clothing to be put down. x) )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will begin to move too,he was slower,but still had somewhat of a fast reaction with them</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (tbh unlee you have projectile the speed stat atm isn't needed.For moving that is XD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) smirked, she'd change her pathing a bit, tilting lightly as she moves a diagonal path towards her opponent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would charge and go straight to her.After he did that he prepared for  the female next move</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) had her smirk fade slightly, a half-formed smile, if it could even be called that, was now visable.
The match would now actually begin, the two of them would clash, leaving any bystander to ponder who'd win.

But victory, for either, was still far away. It had only just begun!

Thus, Hanamura rushed towards the Medic, and just before reaching him would slide over the ground, reaching the boy only to follow up with a jab towards his right shoulder with her left fist.

[D Agility]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at the attack which was given.It was fast,very fast,but he dodged it,by some miracle,whoever he knew the next attack will hit him clearly.For that the man will go,drop a..fish rod? Why a fish rod.And go one step back.

He had a idea,definatly a idea,but would that work out,considering the woman had huge striking capabilities?

(1/1 evasion used,going back with 1 title and dropping fishing rod item)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) squinted her eyes as her opponent avoided her blow. A given, it was likely they'd be able to dodge, but would they last, however?

She heared something drop, but kept her focus on her opponent for now, even as he backtracked away from her.

She rushed forward once more, before aiming a palm-strike towards the back of her opponent's left shoulder, using her own right palm.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) blinked and then quickly shook his head to make sure that his eyes were not deceiving him in any way.

<font color = white>&#34;Turning his back to his opponent... to protect his fishing rod? No. Not to protect it... but I can&#39;t figure out why he would do that... Especially against someone as quick as Hanamura...&#34;</font> he muttered aloud as he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would be hit,a bit too hard than what he expected,but he was standing still.The man had a thought and a idea.With that they will rush in the nearby direction as they prepared the nessecary seals.

Just what the heck was their idea

(Taking moderate injury aka 1/2 hits to defeat me,1/1 evasion regained,going to the west with two steps afterwhich preparing to do kawarimi)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (how do u know the dmg?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i forgot its strength XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (i mean in general. i dont see it in the combat tab rn)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its at discord
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (combat handbook*)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (oh)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (but i was thinking agility = dmg
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Strength VS Durability with a minimum of Light Injury unless they have a body or monstrous body perk.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (so i guess is pety cause i got E+ end
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ah so light then sorry
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I don't have any jutsu yet. ^^;; )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (tbh you guys were too late,there is a rank which gives them out to any student
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (he gonna be tommorow so i guess later down.Its the basic three academy ones XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I figured. Oh well, admins will arrive eventually, too.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) was quite confused. How did her opponent already know a jutsu? Was she severely lacking in her studies? No, that couldn't be it... She was a good student, after all.

Shaking her head, she pushed the thought away. If she were able to rush in, fast enough, she'd likely be able to hold him down before he could finish his hand seals.

Thus, Hana rushed forth, aiming to leap onto the boy, hoping to grab him mid-leap and pull him with her onto the ground.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (a grab?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Grapple/Grab.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (So I guess a grapple, trying to pin you to the ground.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ah..i mean we in equal strength so...guess no one can get out?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I suppose so.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (but i guess you win that one.It says i can use it when im struck,but grapple isn't strucking i guess XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It is, though.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It just depends on the calculations. I think?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (That's what's confusing me. ^^)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (...hmmm yeah,so you got more agi than me,so i guess you stop the handseals?\
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (like im confused aswell XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (If Handseal Speed = Agility then yes, as the order is Jujutsu > Ninpo as well. x) )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i fail then XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause i got e+ handseals
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Saw the woman rushing faster and faster,was she about to attack him? Nope,she grab him and put him down on the ground.Due to the sudden move he cannot finish the seals,neither break from the grab due to their untrained in martial arts body.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm..&#34;</font>He will begin to think outloud while looking for opportunity,his chakra was a bit drained,but he can keep going if nessecary</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) just reduced their chakra by a cost of E - 4 / 5
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (now need to get ouf of a grapple to attack me XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause neither of us got sealess or grapple moves atm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) seemed to have succesfully pinned the boy down, her eyes squinting at him.
<font color = white>&#34;You already know jutsus it seems. Was it a Ninjutsu?&#34;</font>
There was a hint of envy, but mostly curiousity, in her tone.

Hanamura rolled off of her opponent before getting back up.
Were he to continue the fight, she wouldn&#39;t mind going further.
But if it were ended, then and there, she&#39;d be fine with it too.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..ninjutsu
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I know the basics of the academy
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Wow... Amazing. It seems I did miss a few classes and lessons, then...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: not really
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) yells: Well surprise surprise! Nice!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: One person with milky eyes gave it to me
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: The Hyuuga clan head.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Alongside few other scrolls.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) yells: Interesting!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: as you see...im fragile 
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: or well..not quick enough
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) were the fight to be over, which she now assumed it was, she&#39;d hold out a hand to help the boy up.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not fragile, really. Maybe a bit slow, but definitely not fragile.
Training will do us both good.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe if was more faster...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: on the good side..if you did attacked me i would had switched with the fishing rod
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: ... Switched?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm....Thats how Kawarimi works
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You need a object with the size of your torso..then to be hit
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afterwhich you go at the objects place.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I see... Incredible.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If i used more chakra perhaps you would had taken down a fishing rod
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) covered her mouth with her right hand, chuckling softly.
<font color = white>&#34;That would have been surprising and, well, quite funny.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than that...there is two other techniques i know
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: One is basic disguise..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And the other? cloning
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The disguise can be seen by any capable ninja,is not something hard to notice,but its good if no one is smart enough
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The clone technique is good aswell
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But..is better if use it as a surprize attack
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I see... I hope to learn more about this, soon, as well.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You will.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you fast like this,i won't be surprized  about your capabilities after learning these jutsus
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Eheheh... Well, I'm not sure if I'd be amazing at it. Speed is one thing, control would be another...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah though its the most basic of basics
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: So your control is fine
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Perhaps... Either way, it was a good spar we had. And I hope our 'craftsman' feels the same way about it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Reminds me...i need whatever i go on my first mission,to spend my money on some kunais
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I got some good eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh. That'll come in handy for a medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: You did mention having trained in Shurikenjutsu. I would love to see you use it, sometime.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If i get shurikens that is.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: cause..im pretty sure the academy doesn't allow its students to wield them
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: True...  I suppose we can't, unless we have permission?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Either way, shall we all head back? Who knows, maybe more people have come around and about?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe? we can ask
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And sure..lets get back
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Tenjin, want me to grab you?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (thnx)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (No problem. ^^)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can search around for other people if you guys want to
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, it's no bother really. They will come around when they are ready, I am sure.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Hmm....
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah,hopefully sooner than later
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) appeared to have begun zoning out once again.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll need to come up with a way to get resources for crafting with...&#34;</font> he uttered.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: What kind of resources would you need?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well..untill you get status of genin...no way you going out of here
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not that is impossible,but its way dangerious for someone uncapable of fighting to enter alone,let alone  mine.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That might be true, but he could ask a higher up for help, in return for a one-time cheaper service, or some sorts.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Sure but there has to be another way...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (at this point ima just be a shinobi fr)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It's still early, don't give up. ^^)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (if going for akihibara doesnt lemme get the crafting perk for free then there is no real diff between crafter and a shinobi who learned how to craft)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i will be the strongest medic XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i mean we can go to akibahara when all of us get genin status
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause i was told if we go without being genins or just...atm we gonna be attacked by ecs
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (like the path is dangerious and etc
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (yeah no worries the resources not the problem i was just thinking about the perk cuz its 20 pts)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (So I'll prob be getting it next week if im lucky)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (atm we getting 3 points per day
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I'm sure the admin team can be talked with, if you plan on starting as a crafter and such.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (after this academy arc ends we going with i belive 6-7? 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (Yeah but they have a fair point at the same time. The free spec thing is for specs that cost 4-6 points so it probably wont be allowed to get anything that costs 20) 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (and they probably wont make it cheaper otherwise alot of shinobi will get it)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (True...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (and i think a shinobi life would be more fun anyway so... we'll see how things turn out)

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: In the meantime...does anyone of you know about the war between the Senju and Hoshigaki?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The..i belive two year war that had happen in the past
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: The one that included the Yuki and Uzumaki as well, I believe?

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Apparantly Yuki and Hoshigaki are near extinct.
