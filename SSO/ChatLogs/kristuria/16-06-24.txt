Unfortunately.... He's fickle and persistent when he's acquired a target.

Despite his irritation, Sogeki admires the audacity of someone willing to confront him head-on.

<font color = white>&#34;Words don&#39;t hurt me, Asa,&#34;</font> Sogeki retorts with a smirk, his voice steady and confident. <font color = white>&#34;But disrespect gets noticed. If you think I&#39;m incompetent, then show me in the tournament. That&#39;s where it counts.&#34;</font>

He steps closer, the tension palpable between them as their egos clash in the arena of words. <font color = white>&#34;You speak your mind, I get it,&#34;</font> Sogeki continues, his tone firm. <font color = white>&#34;But speaking and proving are two different things. You want to checkmate? You better make sure you can back it up.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s eyes gleam with a challenge as he meets Asa&#39;s gaze squarely, neither backing down nor conceding ground. The air crackles with rivalry, each asserting their stance with unwavering determination.</font></font></font>

He began walking past the boy, to the sound of the bells. <font color = white>&#34;However, know this. I strive to be the best. Whether I win or lose, it only strengthens my resolve. So, in the end, I still win.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;If my desire for those around me to do better comes off as disrespectful, let it...&#34;</font>

Asa's challenge lingers in the air, and Sogeki silently acknowledges the seriousness of his resolve. He watches Asa depart, the sound of bells fading into the distance.

With a determined expression, Sogeki shifts his focus back to his own preparations for the tournament, his mind already planning his strategies and tactics. The rivalry with Asa adds another layer of motivation for Sogeki, pushing him to sharpen his skills and prove himself in the upcoming competition.</font></font></font>

It was the youth with slitted eyes.

Handseals are weaved, until the girl transformed into a spitting image of the slit-eyed youth as she slowlyl manuevered towards the tree. That way if it charged her, it&#39;d gore the wood, and not a person.

<font color = white>&#34;How do you even calm a bull down?&#34;</font> Yurei would hear his own voice asking him.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) assessed the scene from up above. Quietly murmuring to himself while he stood on his branch.

<font color = white>&#34; <i>Hm. An escaped bull. Or is that a cow-- eh... unimportant. It probably belongs to a farm nearby. They would probably be upset if we were to harm it, but we can&#39;t let it gore anyone, so... hmm... capturing a bull. Don&#39;t have any rope on me... </i>&#34;</font>

During his contemplations, he used those sharp eyes of his to search the creature for any labels, either seared on by Brand, or hanging off it by tag, that might suggest who the cow belonged to. 

[Using Eagle Eyes, got any notable tags/brands that might suggest ownership?]</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Huh.  I wonder...  Reilin...  I want steak or hamburger dinner...&#34;</font>

She states eyeing the bull...  It could be so tasty if butchered and cooked properly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a rise of bloodlust in the bull's eyes, it was on a rampage; following silently behind his sibling and fellow youth, Meixun arrives to seeing his sister transform right in front of him!

Oh, that's what he's fell behind on knowing--the basics. Well, no matter, there's some things you just have to have a knack for before you can begin. What he can do in the meantime... Is dig.

He positions himself directly behind Shuye's disguised form, and... Sits down, legs and arms crossed he sits on the grassy terrain. His eyes lid to a shut, forcing himself the embue the surrounding motions for a time. Even if there isn't any spike in chakra on the animal, he could atleast anticipate the severity of the being's strike.

That is, if he's able to annouce it in a timely manner for those targeted to react.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) As several people being to act, the instinctual beast does what he must do. He sees everyone around him as a threat to his position as the head breeding bull back at Ram Ranch.

With that he explodes forth towards the slit eye'd kid with incredible speed, not even noticing the replica formed by the girl alongside him. His intention was to ram his head directly into the kid's mid-section, but at the last moment he saw the copy that had been made and pulled up. This resulted in him simply plowing through the kid and luckily not trampling him.

The bull then examines the area for his next target.

(Light injury to Yurei, having bull roll for next target.)

The Fūma said as much from their Sniper&#39;s Nest, loud enough for the crowd of his peers to hear. Even over the loud cries from the aggravated animal.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) placed his multitude of hands in different pockets of his hoodie, walking up behind his albino kin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) steps back. He didn&#39;t see the need to get too close to the beast as is. Still, seeing such a rage filled animal charge down his kin and them jump into action was rather interesting.

   <font color = white>&#34;Be careful, brother. It seems dangerous.&#34;</font>, he obviously stated.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was keeping its attention entirely on how the bull maneuvered, since it was an animal--obviously its signature wasn't to fluctuate as explicitly as a human's. Though the location bias helped exponentially. Meixun's brow furrows slightly, recognizing that it was attacking Yurei's signature. Meaning that it would be vulnerable to any sort of sudden attack by those who were willing to do so.

Despite his lack of direct interaction with the current situation... Meixun is wearing red... Crimson red.

A crimson red silk shirt, still glistening from the time he was partially submerged in the water--if the bull desired to attack anything red? Well.
But Meixun isn't aware of this mythos just yet, primarily due to his sensory form, he continues to mark the animal's movements, waiting for a moment of opportunity to arise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) In this moment the bull was drawn to the clones produced by the transformed girl. They...spoke to him in an unnatural way that beckoned him to them.

A sharp turn is made and an explosion of strength ensues as the raging beast charges directly towards the clone of the girl.

Upon reaching the clone the bull simply runs <u></u>right through it<u></u> and slams into the mountain with tremendous force just as the attempt to mount the animal was made. The impending shockwave forcefully dismounts Yure.

The bull; however, at this point is jarred by his collision with the mountain and takes no further action this turn.</font></font></font>

  It was something further beyond. The environment sustained damage, people ran, but by the looks of it the bull had been clocked by it&#39;s own explosive power.

 Hearing the words of his brother, he clenched the green blades of grass and took a stand.
  <font color = white>&#34;Feelin&#39; dizzy?&#34;</font>

  Yurei would run forwards to drive home a flying drop kick to the bull&#39;s face, just like he&#39;d read about in books.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt)  <font color = white>&#34;Yeah... they&#39;ve got this covered.&#34;</font>

He was not going to give that creature a chance to charge him. He remained within the tree&#39;s canopy, watching the others do with the bull as they pleased. It seems no one had the means to secure it, so violence was probably the only option. Its owner should have kept a tighter leash on their livestock. They have no right to complain. Not after their lack of precautions set this dangerous creature loose on the population&#39;s common folks.

From his spot in the tree, the Marksman pitched a palm-sized stone or two at the bull&#39;s crown, looking to disorient it further. He&#39;s skilled enough to avoid hitting anyone other than his target. Especially with the Bull sitting stationary. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) had managed to lure the beast! She perfectly executed her plan, and the resounding thud and crash of stone and horn particulate that echoed through the park from its impact filled her with a sense of pride. However, Shuye knew that this was now beyond her abilities. She'd given what she could.

She tucked her hands into her kimono like a character on the victory screen as Yurei -- and potentially others-- went to deliver the knock out blow.

<font color = white>&#34;Exicting, dìdì?&#34;</font> She asked him. She touched her pocket to pull a rice candy, only to remember that their spill in the water would have surely ruined it. Oops.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) goes to hit the ground for cover, but is far too late. The kick landing square into his chest and plummeting him into the ground by surprise.

He had been daydreaming. <font color = white>&#34;Ahh! Watch it!&#34;</font> He manages to cry out before he eats dirt</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) already was munching on the soggy balls of sweetness before she even gave tijme to consider handing it to him. He nodded softly, pulling the connective stick from his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;.............&#34;</font> He was very obviously speaking, though atop of his already whispy voice and the fact that his mouth was full, it was unintelligible.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) lands on the ground and then stomps in around the boy&#39;s body to get closer to them.
  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I think I got caught up with the bull.&#34;</font> He said sincerely, aiming to help them up with a hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) grits through his teeth, but couldn’t hold no ill-will towards his fellow peer. His thin arm reaches up to take hold so he can be hoisted back up.

Afterwards he dusts himself off and bows towards the other. <font color = white>&#34;Ehhh...no harm done, really. Thanks for the lift up. I’m Kenzo of the Uchiha&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) nods his head, he&#39;d just kicked down a member of a more noble clan than his own. Yurei took account of it, although it didn&#39;t seem to alter his reactions any.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Mugen, Yurei. Since that&#39;s handled I&#39;m gonna head back towards the north-eastern side of the village.&#34;</font> He stated before muttering something softly to himself.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) waves after Yurei, debating on passing along what just happened to him. But they seemed to actually be sorry, a true and honest mistake.

  <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t go taking any notes from me then.&#34;</font> He said with a light smile of his eyes.
  <font color = white>&#34;You can be my friend, and my brother Raku&#39;s if he takes to you.&#34;</font> Yurei followed with a nod towards direction of the taciturn one.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b6936f>Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) rubbed her nose a few times, looking at the rest of the group that'd gathered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) suddenly felt embarassed, her usually quiet brother quite loud and speaking in a tongue most of these people had never heard before. It was harsh, tonal. She looked to her brother, and the word she uttered is only one; easy to understand.

<font color = white>&#34;Mugen?&#34;</font>

She then turned toward Raku. <font color = white>&#34;--It&#39;s how we talk at home.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) says: You're right, that wasn't easy to explain at all.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) nodded in confirmation, though Shuye's divided attention forced the boy to follow suit. He didn't get the memo that others were attempting to understand what the duo was saying--only choosing to glare as per usual, wondering if there was something he said which meant something different in their language.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) rubbed his face.
  <font color = white>&#34;Still not sure how to feel about that.&#34;</font> He suffered with feeling tied to that red-headed man in some purposeless way.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) shakes his head and rubs his eyes, bringing himself temporarily back to life. He shuffles in his position and heads next to the six armed boy.

Without saying too much, he waves</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) gaze lingers on the Zhu&#39;s for a prolonged moment before he looks to his brother. <font color = white>&#34;You missed the bull earlier.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) whispers faintly.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes narrow ever so slightly indicating he&#39;d gained some form of contentment from his brother&#39;s words.

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: --

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) cocked his head at Shuye's reaction, whatever Raku said--it's not what they call themselves, so he wasn't at all familiar with the term.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) moved off from the area and towards the library.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b6936f>Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) found her ears wiggling as she very closely listened to every whisper from the 'chinese' speaking boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) squinted at Raku, and offered a correction.

<font color = white>&#34;Bu.&#34;</font> Which, clearly meant no, based off context clues. <font color = white>&#34;Xing.&#34;</font> A correction is offered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) looked at the frail black-eyed boy with a suspicious glance. He shuffled away from the boy but began to eye him with curiosity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to Shuye and blinks rather absent mindedly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) raises his head to meet the other’s sight, with a curt nod after.

<font color = white>&#34;I, uh...just wanna say six arms is really cool. Bet you don’t ever have trouble grabbing anything huh?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) says: Boo and Zing.. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You must look up Xing. Not-- whatever word you said. I would need to check my dictionary for whatever that is...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) blinked alongside Raku, something he said tipped Shuye's nationalism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) looked down at his arms, taking them out of his hoodie and clenching his multiple fists and wiggling his fingers. A slight grin appeared on his face. He had to admit, it was a bit of a funny joke.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes... the Tsuchigumo are the most powerful force in Iwagakure!&#34;</font> the boy said with a serious tone but also the naivete of his age.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Eh em...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: The six arms are pretty useful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) couldn’t help but smile at that, he enjoyed the pride the lad had for his clan. He felt very similarly, though he was constantly scolded when he brought it up - many punishments later it was something he didn’t speak of too freely now.

<font color = white>&#34;Most powerful force, huh? I’d consider my family to be the same.&#34;</font> He felt conflicted - he wanted to show up the spider boy now....but he was also interested in his person.

<font color = white>&#34;Two powerful forces coming together down the road could make them unstoppable&#34;</font> His mind deciding the next course of words for him. After all, it would be important to make friends and allies.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6699>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) Kohana&#39;s eyes narrowed as she focused on the six-armed boy. Honestly? He terrified her, and she didn&#39;t hesitate to voice her thoughts.

<font color = white>&#34;Can you use all six arms to cook? That might be the best use for those extra limbs,&#34;</font> she remarked as she approached, extending her arms and awkwardly crossing them. She had no idea how to shake hands with a six-armed freak of nature.

<font color = white>&#34;What is your family?&#34;</font> She speaks to the frail kid. Her opinion of him? His family must abuse, bully, beat, and belittle him.

<font color = white>&#34;With first glance, the umm...Six arms are better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) looks up to the kunoichi who walked over.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, hello, I’m a member of the Uchiha clan - but mostly privately tutored by my mother&#34;</font> She held strict discipline rules ever since losing their father in the war. Just hints of it would be strewn about with the way he acted - shy and mostly meek.

There was another side to him, though. One that was starting to pull while he spoke with his newly acquired Tsuchigomo er...friend? Enemy? It still remained to be seen. The little boy starting to grow into himself bit-by-bit the more he would open up.

<font color = white>&#34;I’m Kenzo, what about you and your family?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) rose an eyebrow as the thoughtful girl joined the conversation. He was feeling uneasy being surrounded by a couple of two armers. They were... different. 

<i>Cooking?!? The Tsuchigumo were warriors!</i>

But before he responded, he was distracted by Kenzo's response. 

<i>Uchiha</i>

Yes... the Uchiha were a formidable clan indeed. The blood that ran through their veins was strong. But certainly not as strong and pure as the blood of the spider.

All of that being said, Okuno was intrigued.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (sorry got pulled away for a sec)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) raised a brow. <font color = white>&#34;It sounds similar.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) pauses as she turns to stare at the boy with six arms and raises three of her own to wave.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) tugs at Shuye&#39;s sleeve once more, it&#39;s been decided amongst himself that it&#39;d be best if Shuye understood what he did. After all, she&#39;s known best for a while by now, it would just be in bad faith to keep his thoughts to his own.

<font color = white>&#34;....Huigui muqin de linghun yexu shi keneng de maamaa?&#34;</font> His words were a knife, not helping by the overbearing and visceral tone which surfaces as Meixun&#39;s neutral state.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6699>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) Kohana stares at the freak...

<font color = white>&#34;Awkward...&#34;</font> Her hand retreats!

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah....&#34;</font> The rejection did not happen if she did not adknowledge it!

Kohana nods respectfully to both, her movements precise and controlled. She introduces herself with the utmost grace, a testament to the strict discipline she has endured from her own mother. However, again not as bad as it seems this Uchiha&#39;s mother treats her own.
<font color = white>&#34;A&#39;lass I am not of noble blood as you both. I am Hoshino, Kohana.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (misread your RP about crossing your arms. whoopsies. we'll roll with it)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (BTW!  I'm getting the Tsuchi bow and those Tsuchi throwing weapons iconed.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) glanced at the retreating hands of Kohana. Perhaps she should be bowing to their noble blood instead?

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to recognize our families. I am Tsuchigumo, Okuno&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) bows with respect in response towards Kohana, remembering to keep his manners about him at all times. It didn’t matter who a person was, as holding respect to everyone would find you your own. At least that’s how he’d seen it.

He was careful though, not to see his mother about. It was late, but there was no telling when she would be out looking for him. If she woke, eventually she would come to find him.

A respectful bow to Okuno as well, as he directs to the both of them. <font color = white>&#34;Well met. Have you guys heard much about what to expect as Genin?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) says: I’m not sure who makes them. But Jonin sounds right

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed to rouse out of a stupor. His words send a coursing torrent of anger through her. Not at him. It&#39;s at what he brings up. It&#39;s one of the things in her life that made her who she was; that loss. That absence. It&#39;d filled her with the need to take up that role as best as she could, along with the role she already had of being an elder sister.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;</font> She answered, in the more common tongue. <font color = white>&#34;I hope not. I hope she has moved on.&#34;</font> It was a mature take. One whose sincerity she struggled to actually hold. She missed her. It was hard to wish well on what you didn&#39;t want to lose when it slipped through your grasp. She almost left it at that, before remembering who she was talking to.

<font color = white>&#34;But if she hasn&#39;t, then you will find her.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: The struggles of a big family. Sheesh.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) asks: Being a man with six arms. Could you not make a mean stir fry?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) bows to his fellow Uchiha, <font color = white>&#34;I also expected the rest of our clan was snoozing. I don’t think we’ve met before now?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) let out a sigh. He would indulge the cooking question.

<font color = white>&#34;I think if I tried I could make the meanest and most angry stir fry ever cooked! The timing of all the ingredients could be absolutely perfect with all of these arms.&#34;</font> he said, gesturing all of his appendages... eh em... arms... around.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (That's the second Tsuchigumo including me.  Which means there's still 3 more to come.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) folded her arms before chuckling. She looked toward Kenzo and could appreciate how formal he was. Though she didn&#39;t reciprocate the action. It was clear she was a bit more rough around the edges than him.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll be Genin soon. Then we can do whatever tha&#39; heck we want... &#39;least I will.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) turned around to his cousin Tsuneko, shrugging slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Well yeah. Even the two arms can make sandwiches.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Wow, that sounds amazing!&#34;</font> she exclaimed, her tone filled with genuine enthusiasm. Perfectly timed ingredients in a stir fry? You could become the ultimate chef! We could franchise my parents&#39; restaurant and become disgustingly rich!&#34;</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) wrapped his arms around his sister, recognizing immediately the distress he'd caused--bringing up something so....Taxing on the mind definitely had an affect on the girl's spirit. It's a good thing he's so well attuned to this feeling, because, well--he's completely null to the more explicit physicality of emotional states.

He doesn't know that she's only affirming him to quell his prodding, though he accepts her answer nonetheless. He remains the hug for a while, not letting her loose until he feels her signature relax a slight bit. Until then, a silent embrace is all he can provide.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: Indeed. I can feel the ryo already. But first I have to figure out this genin thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) returned the hug, wrapping both arms arouind the smaller boy for a long while. Maybe half a minute, before she finally gently stepped back while pushing him lightly until her hands firmly grasped on his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;I, sleep.&#34;</font> She announced, dramatically-- like the title of a play.</font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;But alas,&#34;</font>

She extended a hand - a simple motion and she weaved out a singular seal before she eased forth and motioned to fall from the edge. A softly thud of impact noted, and a visible hue of blue rippled from below her feet.

A word not uttered, and she motioned to push her hand forward so that she could lift him up and off the ground before promptly THROWING him behind her back and into the nearby water. </font></font></font>

Whatever they had planned to say died in their throat as they felt the wind pick up, and they realized Botan had just launched them through the air.
<font color = white>&#34;Aghh!&#34;</font>
a scream escaped their lips before they crashed head-first into the waiting water, sinking down.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: All of you join him, Suimen is a technique that requires some mannerism of control of Chakra flow.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: You form the Tiger Seal, focus, and even the flow of Chakra towards yer feet to counter-balance the water's movement.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Normally its harder to do this on water then a solid object due to the shifting currents but do not fret.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I have all day to watch you all try, fail, and eventually figure it out.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff5050>Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) nods towards the Chuunin, a bit perplexed at the actions of the female chuunin. the brown haired boy would take a deep breath walking forward towards the water. 

<font color = white>&#34;...&#34;</font>

He felt deep down that he was still incapable of learning how to walk on water.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll give it a shot.&#34;</font>

the boy says sarcastically</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) resurfaced and spat the water out of their lungs as they gasped for air and caught Botan's basic explanation.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would go towards the water while wondering if was good idea to do it at all</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) itched at the back of his neck as he watched Bill fly through the air towards the water, wincing as he hits the surface with a resounding splash. With a shrug, he stepped forwards towards the water, sending a glance back towards Najiro.
<font color = white>&#34;Then ye&#39;ll sink! Kahahah!&#34;</font>

With that resounding laugh, he threw up the Tiger seal as instructed. Unfortunately, instinct took over. Rather than attempting to step down onto the water&#39;s surface, his shark-like genetics drove him to instead toss himself into the water head-first, his body moving before his brain could stop the motions, and with a splash, he found himself in the water with Bill, remaining submerged as the orange-haired youth dragged himself up to the surface.</font></font></font>

'I'm the only one soaked...great..'
They fumed silently as they kept trying to adjust their chakra, looking for the correct amount, figuring that once did correctly, they would pull themselves to the lake's surface.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Massive Bull(The restored one-Kristuria) OOCs: (Is the hub working?)

His traditional kimono flowing barely an inch off the surface of the waves. Yes, he was being a show off. He would look on over towards the teacher, then the other's struggling with the technique.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff5050>Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) squats down towards the water scanning the students.

there's no way any of these guys can walk on water.. says in a low ton.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) says: Wow.....
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It seems the Yuki has control over their Chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: As expected.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) eventually resurfaced, letting out a gasp of air and a sharp cackle as his head floated out from the surface of the water. 
<font color = white>&#34;Man... I couldn&#39;t resist just diving in... This time I&#39;ll really try, for real.&#34;</font>

He pulled himself up from the water back to dry land, shaking off his clothing for a moment before throwing the tiger seal up once more, and this time hopping back down towards the water. He remained on the surface for a few moments, before slowly, surely sinking down as if he were standing on custard, rather than a solid surface. 

As he sunk, he gazed towards the Chuunin and shook his head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirked. <font color = white>&#34;Step aside, nimrods!&#34;</font> He said as he confidently scrolled to the side of the edge. Confident as always, he formed the necessary seal and channeled chakra to the soles of his feet. As a last effort to establish his superiority, he looked back at his colleagues. <font color = white>&#34;Watch and learn!&#34;</font> he said before jumping directly to the water.

As he hit the water, his feet slid right out from under him and he went face first into the water. <font color = white>&#34;Gyahh!&#34;</font> he exclaimed as he splashed dramatically. During all this nonsense, both of his shoes slipped off and went sailing above his head. One of them landing on the ground and one in the water, next to Bill. 

As Asa surfaced, his face was noticably red. <font color = white>&#34;Hmph...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

His right foot gives out tumbling into the water..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) felt themselves slowly rise in the water as their chakra pushed them up, and with a moment of concentration, they would spread the same amount of chakra to their hands as they pulled themself to the surface and stood atop the water with shaky legs.
<font color = white>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m about to fall right back in...&#34;</font>
They said, struggling to keep their balance atop the water&#39;s surface.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eyes narrow down on the chuunin as he begun the first lesson of the day. Taking notes on the instructions given, Afro marched over towards the edge of the water and replicated the same handseals for practice. Once content with his flow, he moved to a second attempt. This time, with a bit more confidence, he'd leap up over the rails with one hand and begin his descent, the sound of his shirt flapping in the wind would come to a stop once as both feet came crashing on the water's surface, generating a strong ripple. 

Just below his feet a school of fish can be seen scattering away from the academy students. Clearly they were disturbing the natural habitate of the area with this assignment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: While you are all down there, why not catch me a fish each. I'll show you how to properly start a campfire next.

One second. Two. Five. Ten. Thirty. Sixty.

He was acclimating to the surface of the water, the feel of the current, and the feel of the Chakra as it padded the soles of his feet. After a whole minute and a half, he heard the Chuunin&#39;s words, and a shark-like grin spread upon his face.

<font color = white>&#34;Now that&#39;s something I&#39;m GOOD at.&#34;</font>

And in no time at all, he disappeared under the water&#39;s surface once more.</font></font></font>

After that, he saw many of his peers managing to follow suit and walk upon the surface of the water themselves. Tenjin then stepped forth.

He lept up into the air while weaving a handseal and focusing his chakra into his feet allowing it to be like an adhesive that made him stick to the surface of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm... &#34;</font> he hummed to himself as he noticed that he was standing on the surface but with too much instability. He needed to get to a point where the ebbing and flowing of the water was not constantly threatening to make him fall over.</font></font></font>

Attempting to maintain his balance, the student would begin walking, slowly advancing up the stream to create some distance between him and his peers.

Once on top of the water, he did his best to stay there.

They will do it without any major issues due to traning somewhat their chakra control,whoever it did drained them somewhat of their chakra to do anything besides walking,if they runned,or even worse attacked,they will simply fall into the water.

Though he wanted to see if perhaps he can increase the timer his chakra did,so he will stay,and check for himself.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) once more did not emerge from the water's surface for a good few moments - It'd almost be worrying if it were not for his particular acclimation for the water. Lurking under the murky surface like a predator, he found himself stalking the undercurrents for the fish that the Chuunin had requested.

He was no stranger to the canals of Amegakure, and he was no stranger to the sea life that called the waters around the village home. Plus, he had the natural advantage compared to his peers. While the surface was their domain, the waters belonged to the Hoshigaki, and in time, they surrendered to his will.

He finally re-emerged, holding a writhing, squirming eel in his left hand, and in the right, a fair-sized Yellowtail, of which he dropped down in front of the Chuunin.

<font color = white>&#34;COME HERE FISHY FISHY!!!&#34;</font> 

Over and over the boy would continue his attempts. Failing over and over until he manage to capture a big fat and plump fish with broad fins.

<font color = white>&#34;This looks like a cat-fish no?&#34;</font> he&#39;d ask as he hoisted the fish over his should with one hand cupped through the mouth and gills.

A small smile could be noted easing across her face as the edges of her lips slowly crinkled. 

Oh god no! 

   <font color = white>&#34;Here is fine,&#34;</font>

A shift, and suddenly she sent her fist directly into a nearby tree - one that was obviously nearly at the end of its span. A brief creak, and then suddenly it exploded with raw vigor. 

A shower of splintered, and now usable fire-wood was littered around it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Now the fun part,&#34;</font>

Her hand eased back behind her back, and met with the opposite. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Each of you gather a bit of wood, the dry stuff, and some grass,&#34;</font>

She returned to her place.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) as she returned to her place; she was met with a fish flying towards her - in proper fashion she continued to hold her place, and as it eased nearest to her? She extended the same hand used before to turn a tree into firewood, to simply catch it within a claw like fashion. 

A brief SNAP could be noted. It was plopped down admist the others. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Very good, Asa,&#34;</font>

She then put her hands behind her back.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll turn up. I can prepare fish, yeah! Also- Yes, Hoshigaki, I know, it&#39;s hard to see me with the water behind me and stuff, but I assure you, I&#39;m ACTUALLY here.&#34;</font>, he spoke addressing the stern boy, the Chuunin and the girl with the enchanted aura in turn.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded; she moved to draw something from her hip and in turn it was a rather fancy-gilded and ornate dagger. It wasn&#39;t much but it held pupose, and she tossed it over towards the Hoshigaki.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (oops

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (set up a village wide battle, with a score system.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..but i already know that
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) caught the knife - Barely, almost fumbling it and dropping it to the ground before achieving a firm grip. Deciding to work on the biggest fish first, he approached Afro&#39;s large Catfish, before tilting the knife, lining it up with the fish&#39;s eye, and spiking the knife into the fish&#39;s brain, killing it instantly.
<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s better to make sure the fish is dead before you prepare it or it&#39;ll thrash, for big fish it&#39;s easier to either spike it through the eye or to slam it against a rock REALLY REALLY hard.&#34;</font>

From there, he began to prepare the fish, spilling the catfish&#39;s guts as the Jounin approached. He pointed a free hand to Afro, the red-headed individual, while his free hand began to disembowl the fish, tossing the scraps into the water behind him.
<font color = white>&#34;Gotta get the insides out, they&#39;re not good eating. If it&#39;s a lady fish, you might find some roe inside, which is REAL good eats though, so you gotta pay attention. This one doesn&#39;t have any.&#34;</font>

From there, he descaled the fish by scraping the fish&#39;s skin with the blade of the knife, peeling off the hard, inedible scales and leaving the skin below, and once more he tossed the scraps into the water.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, so, we can eat the head too, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of it, so someone else can have that part. Now we gotta light the fire, and make a little contraption to actually cook the fish. We can just prop it up over the fire, or make a little spit for it with some sticks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) strolls slowly through the village, their elegant kimono swaying in the Amekagure breeze. They would slow their approach as they noticed the large gathering of people.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what&#39;s going on over there?&#34;</font>, they thought, looking around for a vantage point where they could see what everyone was circling. They would walk over to a tree near the commotion, their small frame dwarfed by the massive conniferous tree.

With a grunt, they would jump not very far into the air, grasping the tree and slowly beginning their climb up. It would take a few minutes before they found a branch that could hold their weight.

With a small childish squeal, they would grab the sturdy branch and sit upon it dangling their legs as they observed the crowd below.

<font color = white>&#34;WOW! That&#39;s a big fish.&#34;</font>, he said with a child like giggle.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) looked from left to right, and seeing that nobody was willing to help he let out a sigh.

She motioned to draw a rather old looking, blunt, and well-used Kunai from the confines of her sleeve. It wasn&#39;t much to look at, but it had a purpose and she was about to show it. 

A moment more and she kicked up a flat rock from the ground before she caught it, and then motioned towards the gathered bundle of sticks before she rolled the rock forward, and then followed with the Kunai. 

A brief strike, and she smeared it across the stone-face before a few sparks flickered forth.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'll make it work.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Heh, sounds quite difficult..
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: That's the spirit, test previously established limits!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the rules of engagement from the light-haired senior who hosted this streamer game. It was unusual, something he wasn&#39;t used to, but truthfully it did sound a little fun. It was a raw test of agility and not much else.

  <font color = white>&#34;Seems like it&#39;ll be based mostly on chance if you make it to the end. I&#39;m game for a little flag tag.&#34;</font> He leans off the wall.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So what are streamers?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) hummed softly, not too sure how to come out of this successfully. She doubted she'd win but figured it'd be a good way to pass the time so she moved toward the crate and grabbed herself a velcro belt with one streamer each, strapping both to her hips.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) picks his nose without a care in the world, before tossing the booger to the side. Luckily, confucianism made it impossible for younger people to criticize the elderly.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohohoh.. Iwagakure sure loves its violence.&#34;</font> he comments as he takes a seat, fully intending to watch the brawl unfold</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: What are streamers? The red and blue fabric attached to your velcro belts.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) begins to roll his shoulders and grins at Katora. Knowing that the masked boy couldn&#39;t use his eagle eye to snipe flags off of belts. With his arms rudimentarily stretched he steps forward! Grabbing a belt and affixing the little streamers to the velcro spots on the belt.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright! I&#39;m gonna win- Wait how do we win this game? Do we collect a bunch of flags?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So ya lose both, you lose?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) barked out a laugh <font color = white>&#34;A fun game I suppose if not simple, if only I had some sake to sip as I watched.&#34;</font> She said notig the blonde had not replied to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;A more fitting name would be Royale Rumble.&#34;</font> She said as she stalked closer to the crate to reach in and secure her belt across her waist.
<font color = white>&#34;Let us dance then!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Percisely!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Who do I room with?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked to the set of velcro belts and put one of them on, adjusting it so it&#39;d feel comfortable for her. It would probablyy be a bit chaotic right from the get go so she did the smart thing of gettting a bit further away the moment she could to not get instantly defeated by everyone at once.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font> she breathed in, slowly inhaling and exhaling. <font color = white>&#34;Who wants to go?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Last person standing wins!
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Duh..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh, cool
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: It's a -free for all-
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh so we don't hold onto the flags or nothin'. Goooooot it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) scratched the thinking side of his skull and then walked forward towards the dark trove to claim a Ninja Velcro Belt. Complete with two streaming wisps on each side of his waist.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Let go of me.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It sounds like... the kind of game where getting jumped is very likely.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Perfect!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Forming a squad seems like the ideal counter, but... going it alone sounds more fun.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) squinted a little.  Another game to play, honestly she was currently not a fan of these kinds of games...    Or well, games in general after the one earlier thus she was currently trying to decide to she should take part in this or not.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm...  Choices.&#34;</font>

She whispered to herself softly.  Though she would find herself having a question.

<font color = white>&#34;Um.  If we capture other peoples flags.  Do they count towards our life or just shows we eliminated people?&#34;</font>

This was important.  If it counted towards one&#39;s life, then those who were agile would win.  If it didn&#39;t then those who formed groups and ganged up on others would win...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Hideo!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) peaked around the corner, watching students viciously attempt to steal each others streamers. Some had interesting tactics like teaming up, or staying in a silent secluded spot.

Some scrapped by with physical talent alone.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) submerged himself from the water, clambering up to the bridge in order to retrieve some of the mixed concrete. Thankfully, it was in a handy container by this point, but it was HEAVY, and it weighed him down as he lifted it. His brow furrowed, a sigh left his lips, and once more he shifted himself down into the water, this time taking MUCh more care in order not to spill the concrete, or otherwise contaminate it.

However, once getting down into the water, reaching the support strand wasn&#39;t much of an issue. Hefting the concrete under one arm, he threw up the Tiger seal with his free hand, utilizing the newly-learnt Suimen technique to balance himself on the water&#39;s surface as he approached the glaring cracks in the support struts. From there, it was as simple as lifting the concrete, pouring the new concrete into the crack, and then smoothing it down with a conveniently-placed trowel he had placed into his backpouch earlier. 

After a few moments, he took a step back on the water&#39;s surface, gazing at the concrete-filled crack like a proper contractor. After a quick nod, he yelled back up to the bridge.
<font color = white>&#34;Crack&#39;s fixed, I&#39;ll look for more down here! Thanks for the concrete, everyone! Teamwork makes the dreamwork, just think of the Ryo and the praise we&#39;ll get for this!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) sighed; she had appeared once more yet this time she held a selection of items atop a small cart. She groaned, and eased it over towards the northern section of the bridge. 

It was a cart of hard-hats, pink hard-hats. 

   <font color = white>&#34;So you don&#39;t all die,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Neku(The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) OOCs: (I put my starting age at thirteen did I goof?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (nah, yer good.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) quickly makes her way back to the hardware store. She orders several more bags of concrete then makes sure to get the necessary tools which included trowels and whatever else was necessary.

She then went by and picking up some metal that could be used as railing when they got to that point along with whatever bolts and screws could go along with it.

As she made her way back to the bridge she made sure to get some vent piping that was long enough to be submerged into the water so that they could direct the concrete towards the break in the support beneath the surface.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) yells: Besides! Five more minutes and we can we take the first of our fifteen ten minute breaks! We're only working for three hours, so it's all good!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: four..
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Wear a hard-hat, you can grab one from the cart.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: and it has some additonal tools buried in there.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Or...was it landmines?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) smiled with an icy chill towards the stern boy, as he turned his head to the wheelbarrow. His small legs would scurry towards it, slowly approaching and examing the old shoddy wheelbarrow.

<font color = white>&#34;This doesn&#39;t look very sturdy...&#34;</font>, he said, as he grasped the large handles with his small hands. WIth a comical push, he would attempt to roll the concrete, pressing his entire body against the wheel barrow, as it slowly began to move inch by inch.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s....so...heavyyyyy.&#34;</font>, he said, as he struggled to slowly move the valuable concrete towards his shark-like comrade. <font color = white>&#34;Here I come, Sharky! I got some concrete!&#34;</font>, he said. After what felt like an eternity, he would reach the spot where the crack had been marked by the coral.

Panting and slumping down on the side of the wheelbarrow, he would yell out. 

<font color = white>&#34;Sharky! I got the concrete.&#34;</font>, his words broken by exasperated pants and gasps for breathe. <font color = white>&#34;Yuki are not meant for hard labor.&#34;</font>, he moaned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The restored one-Kristuria) yells: ALRIGHT LET'S GET THIS SHOW ON THE ROAD!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The restored one-Kristuria) arrives at the bridge whilst examining a set of plans.

<font color = white>&#34;No, no, no. This doesn&#39;t look right at all!&#34;</font> he exclaims, while squinting at his plans.

He then flips the plans over, <font color = white>&#34;Ohh, okay. I see. I&#39;m Contractor Kreig.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will get out of the break he had given to himself,as they did that they will begin the final part of their workday.The workers told him they need concrete for the bridge handle parts.The handles were already made,just they needed to pour the concrete around the parts and make it cool off.With that the workers gave the conrete mix to the kid and told him to put it into the machine.

Najiro will follow their intructions.As the mix was finished they told him to pour it carefully and without putting too much.As Najiro did what they said he either due to stress or just worrying put on each of them too much.This dissapointed the workers,but they called a kid afterall.

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: C'mon now boys and girls we ain't got all day. Dealdine is coming.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Contractor Kreig(The contractor kreig-Kristuria) OOCs: (Deadline*)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) returned the thumbs-up to the Yuki, collecting the new batch of concrete and discarding the now-empty container he had grabbed originally... And just like that, he was back into the water, the container of concrete hefted above the surface as he continued to inspect the support strands. The damage was substanciaal, but most of it seemed to be above-water, causing for easy fixes with the application of the concrete mixed by his fellows.

However, one strand gave him pause. Resting the concrete on the strand, he dove under the water, and felt a chill down his spine. There was a fairly substancial crack, from the top of the support strand all the way down to the water&#39;s floor. It took a few moments, but he came back up and immediately yelled out to his fellows.

<font color = white>&#34;Oiiii! BIG crack here! It&#39;s all the way down to the surface, uhhh... Blondie! Chimney idea, do you think you can pull that off?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) walked toward where the cold boy had slumped onto the ground when he heard an ear-piercing voice. <font color = white>&#34;Contractor Krieg?&#34;</font> he asked aloud. <font color = white>&#34;Who even is this guy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Ah, he has the plans.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: For the next few hours? You listen to this guy.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm...alright then
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: But he was holding the map upside down...I dont know if we should take instructions from him if he cant read a map.
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: NOW GOSH DARNIT WHERE ARE YOU ALL'S HARD HATS!? I'M NOT TRYNA CATCH A VIOLATION WITH THE BOARD OF SAFETY.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sure, sure- ah.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) waved her hand at the cart of Pink Hard-hats, she instructed them all to wear moments ago.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'll bring you one, no worries.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (Neon Pink

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) yells: Good of you to wake up and get your hands dirty! Come down here and help me out!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Botan...why is pink
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: My amusement.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) nods to the contractor before promptly going to get herself a hard hat. She'd then look around to see if anyone required anything from her. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) looked at the scene of the bridge before chuckling and shaking his head. He went to one of the bridge workers and asked fora spare Hammer before moving over to a set of planks and began placing them as he tried to nail them into the open areas he hummed as he worked abnd began a tune playing in his head. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-fcbXR39KQ&ab<u>channel=GRAVYBEATS)

<font color = white>&#34;Aye Aye Aye Got my hammer and some nails, Me and the crew workin on the bridge can&#39;t ya tell? 
We may be kids, but we got a lot heart, workin hard for the paper -&#34;</font>, his rap was halted as he jumped wildly as the contractor had yelled at them for not having hard hats. His hammer flies into the ocean as he looks surprised. He peered over before scratching his hair. <font color = white>&#34;Uhhhh oops?&#34;</font>, he muttered out chuckling nervously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) had a look of frustration on his face. <font color = white>&#34;Those are PINK hardhats. That does not go with my hair at all. It&#39;s bad enough my shoes are missing.&#34;</font> He shot a look to where he imagined shark boy was.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) gets up and dusts off his kimono after having taken time to catch his breath. He would slowly walk over to the container of hard hats, reaching in and placing one upon his head. The sharp neon pink hard hat would soften his already soft features, probably making him look even more feminine.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: This ain't no dern fashion show, boi. If ya wanna be on my site you gotta wear one of these. 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Neku(The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) OOCs: (Man we workers or slaves? XD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) walked forward slowly, his hands stretching out from his rough kimono as he grasped two.. Neon.. Pink.. Hardhats. A face full of displeasure as he simply continued on towards his cousin. Pink or not, was of little matter as long as he got well rewarded from this. 

<font color = white>&#34;Aye, aye, I&#39;ve heard the rest of the clan was out and about, so it made no sense for me to stay put.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (you know the answer.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) quickly made his way over to the side.

<font color = white>&#34;I won&#39;t ask ya to do anything I wouldn&#39;t do myself. I simply expect you to match my effort.&#34;</font>

The contractor yelled before he grabbed a <b>LARGE</b> piece of the rubble and effortlessly lifted it. He&#39;d shorlty thenafter hand it to the shark-like kid. 

<font color = white>&#34;Here go put this in the rubble pile.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Wow, you look strong.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) was already in the water, hefting a container of concrete as he grinned up at his cousin on the surface. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve gone and volunteered to check the supports - Since the water ain&#39;t an issue for me and all, but there&#39;s one that&#39;s got a huge-ass crack all the way down to the floor underwater. NO idea how to fix this, but someone suggested a chimney of some kind, so like... Yeah. Pass me down that hat, would you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would be making his way over with a bundle of sushi and food for all the people working hard on the bridge. He wasn&#39;t particularily physically skilled but he could pitch in to help out those who were busting their asses working at it. With the few little clacks of his sandles he arrived with a very large bundle. He was going to have to make several round trips. He was certainly that this bridge built in part with child labour would entirely hold up. Though he wouldlook over to the hard hats being given out. 
<font color = white>&#34;Do I need to wear one of these even if I am just delivering food to the folks working here?&#34;</font> He calls out having brought plenty of cooled drinks as well.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Incredibly strong..
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: Grab the piping over there to make a funnel for the concrete.

<font color = white>&#34;Right, can I grab that pipe while you put that in the rubble pile? That feels, uh... Like a better idea.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: You'll want to drill the bolts at least six inches deep into the concrete to anchor the railings.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) did, indeed, catch the hardhat with his free hand, strapping it on top of his straw hat in an almost awkward configuration.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Neku(The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) OOCs: (I wonder if i could use Byakugan to see how deep I would drill the bolts into the concrete....)

Asa kicked a rock into the water, immediately lifting his leg and grabbing his foot <font color = white>&#34;Ow ow ow ow!&#34;</font> Immediately, he regretted his decision of kicking the rock with his shoeless foot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) mosied on over and picked up that pipe with the strength of a man whom has been doing hard labour his whole life.

One hand carried the pipe whilst the other grabbed at his lower back.

<font color = white>&#34;Darn wife wants me to go to the doctor, but we got a deadline to meet.&#34;</font> the man mumbled to himself as he made his way back over towards the edge.

Without much care he began to drop the pipe straight towards the Hoshigaki in the water. Hopefully he was good at catching round, awkward things with sharp edges.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) had just managed to put the hardhat on as the pipe lowered down towards him, and he just managed to avoid the sharp point as it plunged down towards him. He did, however, manage to grab the pipe before it fully submerged. With that, he yelled up to his fellow Hoshigaki.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay! Okay. Great. Good. Yo Cous, wanna come give me a hand with this? We gotta keep the concrete dry with this pipe while we fill these cracks. We can probably leave the pipe in there once we&#39;re done and fill THAT with concrete too. You down?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Over there,and that place too&#34;</font>He will say as they pointed to the places</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded. She seemed to wander over towards Najiro with no true hurry in her movement - as she eased into place? She produced several bolts from behind her back, she was prepared. 

It didn&#39;t take much for her to simply drive them into place with but a flick of her hand, a bit of raw muscle, and they were slammed into home. She repeated such actions as required for each bolt. 

It took only a moment or two. 

   <font color = white>&#34;There we are,&#34;</font>

She returned to her place shortly after.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) was, simply put, waiting for the magic words to be spoken. Asking a half-shark kid to hop into water was akin to asking if a junkie wanted another fix. With a small grin, the boy vaulted over the guard-rail. His body submerging within the body of water beneath the bridge. Awaiting orders and ready to work, he stood - or swam, rather.

       <font color = white>&#34;For sure, beats staying up there, plus, swimming is so much more fun t&#39;me. Jus&#39; tell me what t&#39;do and I got it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) hopped across the bridge and next to the half-shark boy. <font color = white>&#34;Hey there, what&#39;s up!&#34;</font> He said with a slight maniacal glint in his eye. <font color = white>&#34;You guys are doing some good work over here. Need some help? Oh by the way... Do you need any snacks? That cold lookin&#39; boy brought some snacks. What do you prefer? Fish? Chicken? Beef? ... Shoes?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: Haha just kidding. I'm sure you and your cousin don't eat shoes... Right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Chicken.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) yells: Yeah, just- Just hold the pipe against the crack and make sure the other end is above the water so I can pour in the concre- WE DIDN'T EAT YOUR SHOES, BUDDY!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Hmm?
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) asks: GOSH DARN IT WHERE IS THAT KID WITH THE DRINKS?
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) yells: WHOOOA! I never said you did! I'm just asking what your tastes are!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Uh-huh.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm fine with any snack, personally.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oi, oi- Actually, now that I think about it. That fish should be done now. It's just by the big pillar.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (oh rammy.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: You can grab that for everyone, if you want.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and pouts at the words of the dark-skinned dancer. He would slowly walk towards the village, dragging his feet while lifting his kimono as to not sully it.  A visible scowl/pout on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;This is not fun at all...&#34;</font>, he mumbled as he headed deeper into the village, the sound of yelling and footsteps disappearing behind him. After a 10 minute walk, he would arrive on the steps of a large building with a large bright neon sign reading <font color = white>&#34;Ame Convenience&#34;</font>.

A sigh escapes his lips, as he enters and begins collecting packages of water. He would make multiple trips from the isles to the counter as he stacked 3 cases of water onto the counter.

A trickle of sweat would slide down his small brow, as he wiped it away with his sleeve. He would then head towards the back of the store and begin grabbing bags of ice. They were surprisingly less hefty than he had expected. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, do you happen to have something I can carry all this in? They wanted me to make multiple trips but I dont think that is going to work. It will take forever.&#34;</font>, he politely asked the shopkeep. He would explain his work at the bridge and how he had been assisting with rebuilding the destroyed bridge.

After a long discussion, they would be directed to the shops horse and buggy which he would loan the child only due to it being a mission to assist the village. After paying for the supplies, the small child would load all of his material into the horse and buggy, getting into the carriage and grabbing the reigns. 

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you, sir!&#34;</font>, he said, before quickly having the reigns snatched by the shopkeep who also entered the buggy. Apparently letting a 10 year old disappear with his only method of transporting his stock was too much to ask.

With a pout the two would slowly head back towards the bridge, the large stockpile of water and ice bouning in the carriage. As they approached all of the busy works scurrying around the bridge, they would wave. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: He just arrived.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) followed the Black haired males lead and began helping point out the bolts that needed to be drilled intot he rail. He creates a half-ram seal activating his Dojutsu to get a better view and get the spots the Black haired male could not see.

<font color = white>&#34;Byakugan....There are more over there Lady! Further down from where you bolted the others.&#34;</font> he said pointing down to where they were. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I'm back everybody!

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Sorry it took so long. I was not going to carry this all back myself. Luckily the shopkeep was nice enough to deliver what we need!
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: YOU ALL GET THREE MINUTES TO HAVE A DRINK AND A SNACK BEFORE WE RESUME.
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) yells: WE HAVE A DEADLINE TO MAKE!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The work in progress-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..A deadline?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: Awww man Three minutes???
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) yells: THIS BRIDGE ISN'T GOING TO REPAIR ITSELF!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) Would have left to assist the cold boy with his moving of the water and ice. All things considered they would haul it on along. Pushing it back and forth to the best of their ability. Though he would move from the other to Foreman Kreig. His hands lugging the two large jugs of iced tea on over to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Here you are sir.&#34;</font> His arms was shaking eeever so faintly. He was ill suited to physical work!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded; she eased back over once more - and this time towards the Hyuuga that had pointed out the locations. She took it upon herself to quickly jostle a series of bolts into place much like before - a few brief flicks of her wrist, and she slammed several of them home. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Very well,&#34;</font>

She chuckled, and eased back over towards her spot once more. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: YOU! GET A TROWEL AND START SMOOTHING OUT THE CONCRETE THEY JUST POURED ON THE SUPPORT BEAM.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The work in progress-DragonQuestVIII) narrowed her eyes in a stint of confusion. Having only just arrived, the sudden gathering of blue-collared &#39;workers&#39; caught the girl by surprise. It didn&#39;t help that someone had already taken time to outright demand something of her.

     <font color = white>&#34;Is this some new way of asking for help..?&#34;</font>

She murmurs, her eyes trailing from the loud contractor to the crowd of youth.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) did as instructed by his older cousin, keeping a firm grip on the pipe. Whilst being utterly clueless in the eyes of stuff like this - Jinbeisame caught on quite quickly. The boy's grip tightening around the pipe as the concrete was soon to be poured. Or at least it was until the mention of a <b>THREE. MINUTE. BREAK</b>. Was this the life of the men behind the repairs of the village? A simple three-minute break? A silent prayer was made that he never failed as a Shinobi and would have to submit to <i>this</i> layer of work.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Yes, we have to make deadline. You&#39;ll be compensated for your efforts. I just need you to make it smooth before it dries.&#34;</font> he continued on towards the center of the bridge where concrete had just been poured into the support and more of the genin were starting to work on the railing.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) began to pour the concrete into the pipe held firm by his younger cousin, motioning him to tilt the pipe further and further as the pipe itself began to fill with concrete. This, was the best way to go about fixing such a crack - Otherwise, the concrete would become damaged by the water, and due to the sharp point of the pipe, it would be easy enough to lodge it in the ground, creating a solid pillar of concrete within the crack itself to maintain structure. The surface level could be fixed traditionally, but underwater, the concrete would become waterlogged. Thankfully, two shark-men are better than one.

<font color = white>&#34;Eh, break? Three minutes...? We&#39;re not exactly doing anything strainworthy here just yet, we can just save our three minutes and take a six-minute break later. Keheheheh!&#34;</font>, he barked out, as he eventually filled the pipe with concrete. 
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, now just put it flush into the crack, lean it all the way vertical so the point is digging into the ground at the bottom, and we can fill the top part. This thing&#39;s just a solid concrete-steel pole at this point, it&#39;ll keep this strut held good.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

     <font color = white>&#34;Make it smooth..?&#34;</font> she parroted before walking behind him towards the location of the freshly poured concrete. She kelt down towards the gray-colored material. Once more, her attention went to the tool. Was she supposed to just..?

<font color = white>&#34;Like this?&#34;</font>

A quick hand pushed down upon it; clearly far too hard. Rather than make the material smooth, she actually left a rather large indent within it.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) marched on over to the girl with a trowel of his own.  He quickly manipulated the surface of the concrete where he&#39;d pressed down too hard. 

Expertly the career construction man was able to repair the damages made by the girl and create a very smooth surface.

<font color = white>&#34;Like this, see?&#34;</font> the man stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will pour the mix of concrete on the bridge.After he did that they will get the trowel and smooth it up untill everything looked nice and fine.The only issue he can see is if accidentaly do a slip up and burn their skin,but that was impossible,atleast for now that is</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;DON&#39;T GET SMART WITH ME!&#34;</font> the seasoned veteran exclaimed as his right hand came forth to grasp the boy&#39;s shirt. 

With this leverage Kreig effortlessly lifted the boy from the ground and held him over the ledge of the bridge.

<font color = white>&#34;Now are ya gonna lay my forms or do we want to keep playing around?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) walked over to the cart and grabbed a trowel. He would scan the workers around the area attempting to gain knoweldge on how he should be performing his work. After a few moment, he would follow the contractors example.

He would smile as the contractor marched over the stern boy and lift him off the ground holding him over the edge of the bridge.

<font color = white>&#34;Now drop him!&#34;</font>, he would exclaim, his face giddy with excitement.</font></font></font>

With that the construction worker simultaneously released his grip on the boy&#39;s shirt and took a firm grasp of his pants. Giving him the most gnarly wedgie imaginable.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah hows ya like that? Ya gonna work now?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Yet again, the mirror&#39;s the man&#39;s words. Her hands move once more, a standard attempt at imitating what he had displayed for her. She presses softer into the ground this time with the tool. There doesn&#39;t come a hard bit of damage like before... but the area certainly isn&#39;t the smoothest to anyone with a good eye.

For an amateur, it was all one could really expect.

     <font color = white>&#34;I guess.. As long as this thing pays.&#34;</font>

She continues with her attempt, a few bits and bobs of concrete manipulation until the area was, in her eyes, complete.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) positioned his body to catch himself on the water before immediately realizing his fate was not so sweet. <font color = white>&#34;YYYYYYAAAAOW&#34;</font> he said as his underpants did things to him his uncle could only have dreamed of.

Wriggling and desperately attempting to free himself from the contractor&#39;s hold on his undies, he said <font color = white>&#34;Fine! Fine! Just let go!&#34;</font> and with a whimper, finished with, <font color = white>&#34;This is child abuse...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) listened vigilantly, the rather strong arms of the white-hairted half-shark would tighten around the steel pipe once again. Beginning to do as he heard and &#39;flush it into the crack&#39; from a vertical angle. Truth be told, this boy was learning as he went, but nevertheless - he caught on quickly. Now shadowing the actions of his relative. 
                 <font color = white>&#34;Like this, right? Or am I being to loose along the steel pipe..?&#34;</font>, he spoke, his words coming off as a new employee seeking affirmation.

The actions of what went on above his head caught little of his attention. Though the audible noise of a kids underwear <i>ripping</i> caught his attention for a short while. A cringed expression spreading across his face but you know..

                        <i>&#39;Better him, than me.&#39;</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) winced as the bridge contractor really did a lot to insure that they were working hard.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) giggled at the display of depravity that was occurring before him. He would watch in amazement as the scream erupted from the stern boy. This was turning out to be more fun than he had expected.

He would slowly turn and begin mimicking the actions of others around him with the trowel while continuing to watch the scene unfold.</font></font></font>

The contractor looked back to the new arrival. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s much better. Just be sure to keep it even. The stuff pretty much levels itself so slow is fast.&#34;</font>

The man then went over to examine the shark&#39;s work. <font color = white>&#34;Lookin&#39; good shark boys. I&#39;ll have you two come up and here and get ready to pour the new surface for the bridge as soon as wedgie boy here finishes the forms.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Isn&#39;t &#39;miss&#39; kind of weird?&#34;</font> She asks, her hands still working to try and smooth out that concrete. Her attempts were slowly getting better-- minus the occasional jab of the edge of the tool into the ground to break herself from the monotony.

 As he finished off pouring the concrete into the support strut he clapped his hands together, before wandering over and clapping his cousin on the shoulder. <font color = white>&#34;We aced it, cuz.
