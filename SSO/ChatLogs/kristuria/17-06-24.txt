<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) lip curled, she was in no place to speak on such matters but she could not help but say something loud enough for her peers to hear. 

<font color = white>&#34;There is only one of them.&#34;</font> She pointed out and looked at the back of the older Shinobi. Would such an offense be let to pass? They had the bodies....but she was one of those bodies herself....</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) looked at sensei as soon as the headbands.<font color = white>&#34;So we are next? I hope not. But you got it.&#34;</font>The teenager seemed too calm and not stressing over the situation. He had full hope in his sensei to beat this guy to death. Taking out his book he would sit down and turn a page. He then noticed Shuye arrived and waved.<font color = white>&#34;Oh hey Shuye you came to the party or warning of this guy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Calmness remained with him throughout the stiff warning.

A Swordsman Messenger declared those he represented an enemy of their entire village. The foremost thought on his mind, reflected from a statement like that, could only be...

<font color = white>&#34;Their days are numbered.&#34;</font>
A soft, muffled murmur, beyond earshot.

More importantly, he&#39;s eager to see whether their superiors might shoot this messenger, who arrived here bearing the highest of hostilities. It was only karma. Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka)  From a squatting position, the girl would begin slapping the ground with three hands to voice her disgust for this kind of attitude!  This was sounding much like a threat, as if he was bragging about killing their genin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ayyo!  How brave!  Killing genin younger than yerself, must feel nice, ye?  Then coming to our gates?  Bragging?  threatening?  Ay ay ay ay.   Message recieved.&#34;</font>

Yeah, this Tsuchigumo girl was pissed, she was ready for a fight!  BRING IT!  Though as for making decisions or actions?  That&#39;s left to Bathroom Sensei.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) couldn't really see the bloody headbands because; his eye sight was awful, and because there were a bunch of people in the way. So the weight of the man's threatening speech didn't really land with the generally dumb boy.

But he did at least still understand it was a threat. It sounded like people had been caught by... bandits? Probably bandits. Outside the walls or something similar. A mostly uneeded warning for Hideo as he had no desire to go beyond the walls to begin with.

The guy had a bunch of swords, for example. What did he have? A cool rock he found on the way here and some loose change. It would take a long while before he was confident and geared enough to much further than he was right now. But he would go that far eventually.

Someone had to avenge who ever the messenger had, probably, killed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) was a bit at a loss, but found herself setting forwards....this was um...no she didnt think she would be the one to handle duties like this...b-but she was the only one awake so...

She sighed and stepped forwards...her students in more ways than one..each showing their own reaction but...most of fustration or well...taunting much less...an act of mmm....an act of...mm.

<font color = white>&#34;just stop it, you cant bind us to the village.&#34;</font>

She found her self looking back to the students..<font color = white>&#34;..mm...ehh..&#34;</font> they found their gaze falling back onto the man south of her. <font color = white>&#34;the entire wilderness is not your territoy. This village and the everything in a one click area of this place is apart of our land&#34;</font> She paused.

<font color = white>&#34;what is your leaders true intentions...&#34;</font>

She later folded her arms and squinted..would there be a possible war?</font></font></font>

What should sound and even look very rough actually seems much more inventive, smooth, more <i>mechanical</i>. As if he were filled with churning devices, and maybe even a static charge that slightly irradiated from him somehow.

To those with ever keen sight, his body had very clear grooves but not like the carving of wood into puppetry - it was more refined and held smoother parts.

<font color = white>&#34;I’m nothing but a messenger for my employers, and once <b>a boy myself</b>&#34;</font> Just for a moment he sounds young and surprisingly natural - as if he were no older than twelve. <font color = white>&#34;I donned your same headbands.&#34;</font>

He glances towards the ground for but a moment, as if stepping carefully for some odd reason. With those having their eagle-like sight though? The area was littered with hundreds upon hundreds of explosive tags - all the way to the gate

If he was going to face an attack here, he at least had an ace up his sleeve. The actions were entirely dependent on Iwagakure though, as he attempts to let them collect and be on his way</font></font></font>

     ...if they moved to attack or secure that retreating fellow, well, he was ready to assist in whatever inconsequential way he could. A pair of kunai found their way to his hands.

Hana continued to listen to the commanding man, her attention unwavering despite the discomfort gnawing at her. The mechanical timbre of his voice grated against her ears, and the sudden switch to a childlike tone sent a shiver down her spine, amplifying the unease she felt.

Shuye's talents were lacking in this department. She was not particularly observant; she didn't have the uncanny ability to sense the energy in things her brother had, either. Worse, she was barely a genin, physically. No, explosive ordnance disposal was far beyond her capabilities.

She wouldn't have spotted them without another shinobi calling it out.

A traitor to the village, daring to come to the front gates...?

Was Iwagakure so weak?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) approached the scene, her eyes scanning over the crowd carefully before noticing someone outside of the gate-- Of course there was.

A sigh escaped her as she leapt overtop of the students, landing next to Chocho. Turning to face her for a moment, a smile is flashed, followed by a peace sign. She then finally turns her attention onto the stranger at their gates.
 <font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, she called out, looking him over from head to toe.

The camera in his eye was instantly spotted, alerting her to put her guard up. Perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps someone was actually coming to spy on them. Either way, it was work she didn&#39;t plan on having to deal with.
 <font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re just dropping stuff off, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font>, she began, her eyes looming over to the field behind him, noting the vast amount of explosive tags that were placed.

 <font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;know.. Someone has to clean those up, and it isn&#39;t gonna be me!&#34;</font>, she protested, venting another sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever..

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Rather dangerous times.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fuma, Katora(The blond lad-Iodized Salt) OOCs: [fair]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mysterious Stranger(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (If no opportunity exists for that, no more than mod and all that happens here is the steps and gate need repair - starters have ryo for that reward now ;D)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was susceptible to the explosions that had gone off unless he was saved by an awesome pair of shinobi. He covers his face, preparing for the worst.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) was probably safe, way up there on the village wall. 
Merely lifting a hand to shield his eyes from the brief blinding light that came with the detonation.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) The explosion erupted suddenly, sending debris and a powerful shockwave. Kohana was tossed to the side, hitting the ground hard and feeling the impact through her body.

As she lay there, trying to catch her breath, doubts began to creep into her mind. Was she really built for this shinobi life?

Unless saved by the Chunin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would of course!...try her best to...block all the explosions!...by explanding her body and body blocking the exterance of the gaze!

She was now...super big...one arm went to the one arm went to the right. It was more to stop the shockwave from reaching them...taking on all of the force!

HOwever...as the smoke settled..she noticed that the commanding man was gone...high into the wind...maybe feelings..unfounded..mm..un found....she then waved her hand to clear the smoke residue...as she watched their now broken stair case...probably covered in crystals...

[Aimed to protect those closest and behind her with multisize body block!]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) vents a <i>massive</i> sigh as the explosive tags begin to detonate outwards in. Perhaps it was time for her to actually take this situation seriously.

 <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s like.. The uncoolest thing you could&#39;ve done, random dude.&#34;</font>, she protested. Her hands came together, weaving through a flurry of seals.

With a clap of her hands, the Shingen musters all of her Chakra into the air above the tags. <font color = white>&#34;Doton: Otoshibuta!&#34;</font>

From out of thin air, a massive lid forms, hovering over the field in front of the group. The surrounding area was of no concern to her, the wall was far too sturdy for any amount of explosive tags to take it down.. To an extent.

The shadow that loomed over all present only lingered for a moment before beginning to shrink at a rapid rate. Anyone who&#39;d not yet realized a giant lid spawned in the air would quickly notice as it began crashing down towards the ground, sealing in the impending explosion.
 <font color = white>&#34;Man.. One of these days I&#39;m gonna need to get paid more... This is getting ridiculous..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mysterious Stranger(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: Cya soon Iwa)

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I'm still deciding on you lot, but that guy definitely didn't pass.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: What is a vibe?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: It's something I have.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: phew
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Did you see his body though...  THat was...  Strange.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Yea. He sounded mechnical...Then like a child. All in one breath.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. His movements seemed a bit... mechanical.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nods in response. <font color = white>&#34;Looked like he was built, or rebuilt maybe.&#34;</font>

She shrugs. <font color = white>&#34;Who cares. He didn&#39;t look all that strong.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches in awe as his superiors demonstrate some pretty awesome techniques. Picking his jaw up off the floor he shouts. Interjecting in the conversation about a supposedly weird body the messenger had.

<font color = white>&#34;That was awesome Koume! Kitsumi! Can you teach us how to do that?! I mean- Obviously not the body thing. But the giant lid thing?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wouldn't be surprised if he were rigged to explode as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) arrives at the gate a few deep breaths could be heard. <font color = white>&#34;Whats going on ??&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would place her hands on her hips not shinking for a moment to watch what was happening south of her from a birds eye view.

<font color = white>&#34;mhm...not that strong..but...smart...our new generation coulda gotten hurt..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) had tensed her legs to leap free but shje found herself looking upwards amazed as the tall women suddenly towered over her and catching the worst of the attack.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Hm? Yeah, if you learn Doton I can.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) felt alot of body heat behind him. He looks behind him and a massive fat man stood there.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey uh..Whats up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: You saved  us.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Wonder how he spread all those explosive tags without being spotted...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: He didn't do something to the guards patrolling the wall and guarding the gate, did he?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) shrugs.
 <font color = white>&#34;Dunno, but I know it&#39;s not my fault!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I'm not sure, but we can talk about it somewhere else, mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Very well. A gate attack while im in the village these bastards sure are a gutsy lot.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Didn't feel like an attack.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: That would make him the winner, speak now or forever be a capture the ribbon loser.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: There has to be at least one or two more, probably. Unless they've quit.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: What's there to talk about? 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Threats gone, its not any of your concern as a student.

But for now he was stuck laying bricks. Because his father was too lazy to summon multiple golems and fix this mess himself. Unfortunately, it seemed like no one else was actually moving forward to help Hideo lay the bricks...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) Daigen picked up a stack of bricks, feeling their rough texture and the weight of each one in his hands. He made his way to the damaged steps, where a gaping hole needed to be repaired. Kneeling down, he placed the first brick carefully, ensuring it was aligned correctly. With practiced precision, he applied mortar and set the next brick beside it. Each motion was deliberate, the rhythm of the task becoming almost meditative as he continued to lay down brick after brick.

As the hours passed, Daigen's focus remained unwavering. He meticulously aligned each brick, securing them with mortar, and making sure the structure was sturdy. Sweat dripped down his brow, but he ignored it, driven by the need to restore the steps for his village. By the time he placed the twenty-second brick, he took a moment to survey his work. The steps looked almost as good as new, each brick fitting seamlessly into place. The satisfaction of contributing to the village's recovery filled him with pride, knowing that he played a part in rebuilding what was lost.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaido(The troubleaker-EllDante) OOCs: (22 bricks)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Only 119 left...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Sakujak, Ryohei (The short-tempered youth-Kwaj874) decided to get started upon the strength training turned manual labor.

<font color = white>&#34;Chop chop he says.. t&#39;ch.. I guess it&#39;ll be good arm training if nothing else,&#34;</font> he says, deciding that it was time to lay the bricks. He began to do so, taking each bring within his hand to get a feel for their weight. They weren&#39;t too heavy, but he still began placing them down carefully in a straight line. It didn&#39;t take too long before his arms began to feel sore, but he was definitely feeling the strain.

He continues, finding that they still had quite a long ways to go, something that causes him to suck his teeth. He glances over at the multi-armed girl.

<font color = white>&#34;Oi.. we could use a hand here. Or four...&#34;</font> he says.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Its not that hard kids...i'll even give you a little hand.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) raised his leg and stomping the ground,a few bricks realigning themself onto the stairs.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante)  wiped the sweat from his brow, his small hands caked with dirt and mortar. The midday sun beat down on him as he carefully laid another brick into place, ensuring it was perfectly aligned with the others. His fingers, though young, moved with surprising precision as he spread the mortar and set the brick down, tapping it gently to secure it. He glanced around at the work site, seeing fellow villagers and shinobi all contributing to the repair efforts. The once-devastated wall of the village was slowly but surely being rebuilt, and Kaido felt a sense of pride swell in his chest. This was his home, and he was helping to restore it.

With thirty-one bricks laid, Kaido paused to take a sip of water from his canteen. His mind wandered as he looked at the progress they had made. The destruction had been extensive, but the determination of the villagers was even greater. Kaido remembered the stories his parents had told him about the resilience of their people, and now he was experiencing it firsthand. He watched as an older shinobi guided a group of younger children in carrying more bricks to the site, and felt a renewed sense of purpose. Taking a deep breath, Kaido picked up another brick, ready to continue his part in the restoration of Iwagakure.

(31 Bricks laid)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) glances at the various bricks and pouts a little, guh she really was going to have to do this.  Wasn&#39;t she?  Well either way, her six arms would begin bundling up the bricks as sh ebegins to carry them over and stack &#39;em up.   Were they supposed to use cement?  She didn&#39;t know where there was cement to get!  Thus she&#39;d just focus on beginning to stack them up.  While others might be doing one or two at a time, she was moving six bricks at a time.  MANY ARM CLAN!

<font color = white>&#34;LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&#34;</font>

Yeah, Tsuneko was one hell of a vibe in and of herself!  The girl continued to work hard on grabbing up various bricks as she moves to stack them up, the six arms working in sync.  Yes, she was very skilled with her many many arms!  Either way, she&#39;d do her job of laying brick.

<font color = white>&#34;Heh.  Atleast it&#39;s not water pipes.  So we can&#39;t go, &#39;Hey ma I&#39;m laying pipe!&#39;  hahahaha.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stopped complaining once everyone else joined in the repair effort. His father showing off his doton mastery was equal parts distracting and inspiring. While he himself couldn't do something like that yet; it did at least make him want to get this over with sooner.

If only to move one step closer to learning how to <i>do</i> that. At least the bricks on their own weren't particularly heavy or difficult to handle. It was just a lot of very tedious, mundane effort. And a lot of bending over. His back was going to be absolutely shot tomorrow...

At least it looked like they were finishing up. The combined efforts of four students, a golem, and an old man were apparently pretty efficient!</font></font></font>

Hawkish eyes took notice of every last detail, down to the way the enemy braced one palm on the stone pavement for support while they snatched for his ankle. 

A simple skip backwards was all it took to clear the grab. Only to stomp right back into reach, aiming to tear the guy&#39;s Ribbon under his sandal&#39;s tread. Again!

But. Haste makes waste. He&#39;s not liking the sound of the Akimichi&#39;s latest utterance. It almost sounds as if they have a plan. And, well, he&#39;s already scored one hit upon them, even if it was by accident...

Hm. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got something fun planned too.&#34;</font>

He answered, while he skips out of grabbing-reach and slices the edge of his hand for the guy&#39;s Ribbon! Intent on shearing it clean in half, flimsy as the material was.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) would have been back on his feet and would manuver out of Katora attack path... <font color = white>&#34;Either do something now or  it&#39;ll be his win.&#34;</font> He then aims to land a punch on the young mans chest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) snickered softly. <font color = white>&#34;Well I did think you could hold out for a little while longer, but I suppose I couldn&#39;t beat him on my own.&#34;</font> with this, the Uchiha took a breath before rushing forward to finally join the fray. Admittedly with her impressively slow speed it&#39;d take her a moment still before she would be able to get into the mix.

But given just how nimble Katora was, winning wasn&#39;t likely an option. She&#39;d take a moment to survey just how many ribbons Chonamu had. She&#39;d now be standing firmly face to face with each of them. But who would she target first?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (Totally forgot to keep round counter going on my markers lol)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) never underestimated an enemy. 
      Overestimation was key. Despite not showcasing such thus far, he suspected the Uchiha might be capable of clearing the distance to him in one stride, which would spell trouble if they saved such like a Trump Card. 

Therefore...
     As the latest heavy-weight hammer of a punch came for him? The Fuma Student dared to dash CLOSER! Yes, he darts into their guard, slanting out the way of that devastating STRAIGHT! It doesn&#39;t even clip him as he, quite literally, ran two steps up their torso. 

Chakra Adhesion of the Wall Walking technique made such tactics possible. He used them as a human springboard, pushing off his second step into a full moonsault, gone flying backwards. He landed on his feet and used the momentum to skip himself even farther. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve spent a good amount of time observing while we&#39;ve tired each other out... so I think I&#39;ve earned a breather.&#34;</font>

You&#39;re a cautious individual. After seeing that, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much of a way for us to win, admittedly. You&#39;d be able to strike either of us at least once and before we can manage to hit you, I think you&#39;d pull that maneuver again, no?&#34;</font> she inquired. Still she&#39;d pursue him all the same alongside the Akimichi.

<font color = white>&#34;Mm? No rules against using chakra, my friend. We are only unable to use weapons.&#34;</font> 

Honestly. That no-throwing weapon rule crippled him the most! But, he would not complain.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong, Reilin. Unless... you&#39;re hiding some serious talent at Taijutsu? I&#39;ve yet to see you throw a punch. That&#39;s dangerous.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was now before the old man. She was now clearly furious at this game. <font color = white>&#34;I said nothing about a ladle&#34;</font> she spat out before taking a deep breath. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am offering you all the ryo I have on me as a down payment for a Katana. This is the third and final time I shall repeat myself. Less I am the fool.&#34;</font> She reached out her gloved hand, tensed and clearly ready to slap something should the word ladle be brought up again

<font color = white>&#34;Do we have a deal?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Deal?
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Red hair is the sign of a harlot...but you wouldn't know anything about hair! "heh"

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) finally hears what the woman had to say, though her attitude wasn&#39;t very appreciated.
<font color = white>&#34;Katana? Why didn&#39;t you say that earlier!?&#34;</font> he clicks his tongue <font color = white>&#34;Making me waste my time..&#34;</font> he mumbles to himself, only to inform the rude girl <font color = white>&#34;Lass, you won&#39;t find any blade from Akihabara for quite a while! The supply chain has slowed down and it will affect sales for the next couple of months! So forget katanas!&#34;</font>

He shakes his head, beside, women were better with a ladle in hand rather than a sword.. though he would keep that opinion to himself, he knew that recently some weird movement called womanism was gaining popularity..</font></font></font>

Yuu had forgot what he was going to say and just mumbles.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) extended hand closed into a clenched fist.

She spun then. <font color = white>&#34;Old dullards here to leer at women. I will be sure to let everyone I meet know to not buy from you or your equally bald friend.&#34;</font> she spat in the direction of the other one who had nothing to say but complaints.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) yells: Buy from me? I ain't selling nothing you can afford young man!

<font color = white>&#34;Probably just started bleeding I tell ya. Hormones make them go crazy! You should have seen my daughter.. went from a lil&#39;angel to a spawn of evil!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) she gave a long glare at the pair for some time. Certainly nothing good ran across her mind but she was sure to memorize them. 

<font color = white>&#34;Careful what toes you step on. This naughty girl does not respect her elders.&#34;</font> with that she gave a flip of her hair and had a seat, intent on going back to her reading. 

<font color = white>&#34;and I am a women grown. I am sure you have forgot what they look like stareing at whatever gargoyle your wives are.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

With that done, he would simply leave the area.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sup.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: .
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns from the librarys and seats himself near a tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) pulls his heaven bound gaze down to the earth. <font color = white>&#34;Hello, Shuye.&#34;</font>, he greets gentley.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Did you find any good books?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shook his head ever so slightly as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;Nothing on Xing.&#34;</font>
All his time at the library and all he&#39;d come to learn within this particular study was that the village had a severe lack of information surrounding foreign languages.
     Though, he didn&#39;t fault them. Books of the nature seemed to pale in comparison to those focused around Shinobi forefronts needs such as combat, tactical and medical guides. 

    <i><font color = white>&#34;Perhaps they were more important.&#34;</font></i> - he thought, dull eyes seeming to peer into the ethereal realm between both him and Shyue as his mind began to race.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed briefly and subtly surprised, based off the widening and then narrowing of her eyes. She tried to remember if there were any books at home she could give him.

<font color = white>&#34;No luck learning a new language, then. There&#39;s a saying -- Rù xiāng suí sú.&#34;</font> The shift to a harsher, tonal language was jarring. <font color = white>&#34;When entering a village, follow its customs.&#34;</font>

Her people, few as they were, had taken that to heart.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) finds his focus pulled back in once more amongst the girl&#39;s shift into a different, natural tongue only to shift back into the one&#39;s he&#39;d come to know seemlessly.
    <font color = white>&#34;Mm..&#34;</font> - He seems to think for a moment, his eyes drifting toward her feet.

 <font color = white>&#34;Why are you here?&#34;</font>, he questions.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) tucked her hands into her sleeves, letting her almost minty green sleeves hang on either side. <font color = white>&#34;My clan lost their home. My dad says that the entire tribe travelled east until the land ended, and then built sailing ships and continued east until they found land again. Then...&#34;</font> She seemed a little unsure to continue, remembering how some of the other children had spoke about the shogunate, and about the previous kage--

<font color = white>&#34;...I don&#39;t really remember much, since I was so young. But my tribe met the shogun. We moved in here, to Iwagakure. My mom was...&#34;</font> more hesitation. <font color = white>&#34;...a chosen servant of the shogun, and he settled us here. But the duel of fates is cruel, so after my youngest sibling, she was--&#34;</font>

A moment was taken to remeasure her emotions, and settle them <font color = white>&#34;--released from her burden. Wán bì guī zhào.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) ears gave lifeless, near robotic analysis in the face of Shyue's rather obvious deterents from certain parts of her story. Upon her concluding her origin he continued to stare at the ground bellow her for a moment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: . . .
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks up at her for a moment.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) Then, back to the ground.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Are you lying?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) quirked a brow.

<font color = white>&#34;Why would I?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm not sure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) stepped forward.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you want me to be lying?&#34;</font> She questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eventually found his ground bound gaze consumed by the being before him&#39;s abdomen and he drags his gaze up to their own once more.
   He was unphased by their proximity.<font color = white>&#34;No.&#34;</font>, he answers.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crouched down, leveling herself with him. She let a moment of silence linger.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you have any questions?&#34;</font> She offered. <font color = white>&#34;If there is no book, at least I can be a primary source.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) blinks for a moment, a dreamy haze overtaking his pupils as he began ot think.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) 's pupils would fill in.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: What is your goal here?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I want to become the greatest medical shinobi to ever live. It's a humble goal.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Why?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: What is your route?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned, returning to the most natural expression she seemed to wear-- a scowl. This one is less directed. Internal. Her joke didn&#39;t seem to land. Finally, she seemed to come up with her answer.

<font color = white>&#34;I have no enemy except death. Therefore, I will deny it any victim, at every opportunity. I will slight it in every way I can. It took something important from me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen even so slightly as she spoken. She..
  Well she seemed to be just about his age yet she knew her. <font color = white>&#34;Purpose.&#34;</font>
    He says aloud.

   <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a beautiful thing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) would smile from ear to ear; a rare sight. Even her teeth were visible, however briefly before she regathered her composure.

<font color = white>&#34;I have to be strong for my little siblings.&#34;</font> Her dad was -- kind, but broken. Shuye had to at once be a mother and a sister to her siblings, lest they grow up to be idiots and get themselves hurt. It left little time for being young and playful. <font color = white>&#34;So... I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to make friends.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: You don't have many friends?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked over at Venturo--

<font color = white>&#34;I think one, maybe. But I&#39;m also concerned he&#39;s going to try to trick me into eating a rock.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Hey Fubuki
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Sup Himeki. How did you do in the free for all?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I lost.. I got jumped by the six armed girl and her cousin
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Damn. Must be really hard to dodge six arms, or twelve.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I thought you were popular like Yurei.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) found herself!...arriving in the area...and looked around slowly to say... 

<font color = white>&#34;morning everyone!&#34;</font>

Though she found herself crouching down..to measure the sparring mat once more.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Morning.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Hey sensei!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-ah also..Fubuki...i need you in a moment
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) shook her head.

<font color = white>&#34;I typically am the one who has to say hello first.&#34;</font> Did that mean you weren&#39;t popular? Shuye wasn&#39;t entirely sure, but it felt like it was true. The difference between being wanted and being tolerated could be subtle at times.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hm? What's up?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-ah..well..i may as well..teach you the the advanced basics of combat..since your awake mhm
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Oh!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) jumped towards the arena with no hesitation, she seemed really excited immediately.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m ready I&#39;m ready!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would raise up from her crawling position and placed her hands on her hips...her judo kimono fluttering before its motion..stopped.

<font color = white>&#34;W-well..well...its good your enthusiastic...lets get to the center of the area...mhm!&#34;</font>

She then moved to the center!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: stay...right there
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walkd to the center and bowed down respectfully for a few seconds, before standing up and getting into a better fighting stance compared to last time.

<font color = white>&#34;As you wi--&#34;</font>

Then it was her biggest nightmare.

<font color = white>&#34;FUCK!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mhm!...dont worry were not doing anything crazy
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Okay...okay...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: step on that..green hop scotch tile

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: This is an extremely elaborate course.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would see as they stepped on the green tile...and suddenly from the side of the walls...a small slot oppened out

<i>shhhhaaa...booshhh!</i>

the smoke left the sides...however it seemed to be...vanish a moment later. When they tried to move..they would notice that they would feel..disoriented...a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;perfect...i will begin the lecture now....&#34;</font> 

She paused..

<font color = white>&#34;you see..in combat...there are things called..mm..ailments that might cause your movement to be hindered...in this case..you were hit with light poisen that targets your motor functions..&#34;</font>

There was a breif pause once more before she continued. She then held up her  herbalist badge..mhm..</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) stepped on the green tile completely unaware of what was going to happen. Suddenly smoke surrounded the girl for a few seconds, of course she ended up accidentally inhaling some of it. Fubuki span around on the same spot looking dizzy and confused, obviously high.

<font color = white>&#34;Wha...whaaat? I can see..uh...&#34;</font> she looked at Koume with a very dumb-looking face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-also also..shuye its not as complicated as you think!...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It looks like there are five different colored squares or more, keys, toads...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would laugh a bit...mhm...

She paused...as she help up her hand and in a poof of smoke...a cup of juice appeared.

<font color = white>&#34;here..take this and have a sip...mhm..you should feel better after a sip&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: and yep...but the toads dont do anything in this course..mhm

<font color = white>&#34;...wah...&#34;</font>

Subconciously she managed to grab the cup of juice and take a sip of it - her eyes went back to normal and all the trippy stuff was gone. Fubuki was back to standing on the green tile, or rather she realized she stood on it the whole time.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...so how does the problem solving work? D-do we constantly get drugged in this game?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: What is this?

<font color = white>&#34;time for the next lesson...you see..in combat..there are also those who use ninjutsu..as you should already know...this causes you to be burned&#34;</font>

She paused for a moment as she reached into her judo cloak and took out a piece of paper to read. Her gaze skimmed through it before she found the passage she was looking for.

<font color = white>&#34;however it only lasts for a short while and....and be cooled with a water source....where that water source may come from..in a village like our own?...im not sure...so be careful of this...mhm...&#34;</font>

When Fubuki&#39;s gaze went unto her..there would be a wet towel mhm for them to and a dry towel for them to cool their skin with mhm

==================== katon burn perk ==================
Name: 

Incendiary Flame  

Desc:

 This character has mastered the art of sticky flame. By carefully molding their chakra, they produce fire from a chakra fuel that is adhesive and sticks to their target once they are struck. This makes it very difficult to remove and the fire will continue burning unless the victim employs precious seconds putting out the flames. 

Note:

Those struck by a fire technique continue to burn for petty injury for two turns. The victim may use their offensive action to put it out or use a water source of medium size or above.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) It was frankly amazing that Fubuki somehow didn&#39;t suspect anything when stepping onto the red tile, only when her foot landed on it did she understand the gravity of the situation. A part of her soul began crying for help.

<font color = white>&#34;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&#34;</font>

Her whole body was surrounded by fire! Her hair and skin got completely ruined and obviously she was burning everywhere. It wasn&#39;t much fire but it was enough to really scare her. While Koume spoke, Fubuki fell to the ground and started rolling around - when she was thrown a wet towel she&#39;d turn into a flaming burrito for a few seconds, rolling with it. Then she fire was put out.

Fubuki slowly stood up and exhaled, she grabbed the other towel and started cleaning herself. <font color = white>&#34;Koume...this is...totally great training, yeah...&#34;</font> she said in pain.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: Yeah, I think they're sparring in the ring.

<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: atleast thats what I'm assuming.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would nod as she watched the walls allow a small hole to open as they stepped on the purple tile. A small tuble with a round point came outwards from both sides.

It was then...&#39;crackle crackle&#39; it was then...an electric shock happened!..moving from left to right...using the water that the human body was made of as a conductor.

It was then it ended...however they would notice that the effects they suffered were worse that the poisen. But would last the less time than the poisen she used.

<font color = white>&#34;You would notice this is a lightning attack this time...these cost..an effect of electrocution....mm..no..a nervous system..error.i believe its called. It messes with your motor functions to a further degree and also messes with a casters handseal speed..not to meantion your how fast you move across the field...&#34;</font>

She paused as she laughed a bit akwardly..while placing her hands on her hips.

<font color = white>&#34;then theres the fact that you can also..stop a persons movement completely...if i remeber correctly from the stories ive heard...if hit directly with a technique itself.&#34;</font>

=========== more info below of the status aliment below ===========

Name:

Numbing Joltage  

Desc:

This character has developed the ability to sustain an electrical current that courses through the body of their victim if they are unfortunate enough to be struck by a lightning technique. The current is delivered as a numbing jolt of electricity that stuns the victim, slowing their reaction times considerably. 

Note:

Those struck by an electrifying lightning technique lose two steps of speed, agility, hand seal tempo, and tile movement until the end of their next turn.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) Perhaps it was evil, or perhaps it was kind, but at least she wouldn&#39;t see what was coming this time. After all it was much easier to instantly feel pain than to see it about to hit her even if it was for a split second.

Fubuki didn&#39;t have time to react to the lightning which shocked her whole body, spiking up her hair and making her stand up completely. When the shock was over everyone nearby could smell the girl was a bit burnt, right before falling to the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I-I-.---I---II....IIII...&#34;</font> the nervous shock had  been so severe she couldn&#39;t even speak, Fubuki was a frozen statue on the floor except for the occassional twitch. However this lasted only a few seconds before she stood up and regained her movement.

<font color = white>&#34;I...I&#39;m alive...&#34;</font> she looked at her hands in amazement. She had no idea training could get so rough.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: I-is that it?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) asks: What's your name even?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would laugh a bit before shaking her head meaning no.

<font color = white>&#34;u-unfortunately not..theres about...one more you might have to suffer through...before we go into..the next section.&#34;</font>

She paused.

<font color = white>&#34;b-but i dont really have a suiton tile..so your lucky mhm!..&#34;</font> With a light wink..she found herself continueing there after. <font color = white>&#34; For suiton..it mostly messes with your movement across the field...if i remeber correctly...same with fuuton....with the case it knocks you back....so your all fine on that front&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: if i had something to add..hmm..it would be to teach you about...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s eyes widened, her soul was ready to die as soon as Koume mentioned there was one more tile to go. But thankfully the game was still in early access and the suiton tile hadn&#39;t been added, so she sighed out of happiness and laid on the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m free...from the pain--&#34;</font>

And then the obstacle course turned into the other one.

<font color = white>&#34;...Fuck.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would poof away her previous course and summoned a new one into existance. Upon returning...she looked to the yellow mushroom.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (br question, do shurikens use agility or strength for its speed)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) grabbed the shuriken and turned around - she saw one of those toads again.

<font color = white>&#34;NOT YOU.&#34;</font>

She immediately threw the shuriken towards the mushroom, hitting it on its big dumb-looking head. Fubuki had a lot of resentment for those things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Oh is she playing the game again?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I assume only fubuki gets to play

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Missed all the fun.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: Yeah, nice to meet you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) continued to stare into the ethers, no telling where his mind had carried him in all his idle <i>'meditation'</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was ignored--

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) actually smiled at Shuye, it was still early for the author.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) didn't wave at Yurei because FUCK him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would hold up a hand to cover her mouth! 

She tried to hide the fact she was giggling at...the resentment she saw. They were off duty..so it should be..f-fine..she hoped.

====================== mushroom! =============

The yellow mushroom found themselves being attacked..and moved forwards to try and attack them before the shuriken hit their body!...however it..the shuriken hit their squishy body before they collaped on the ground to play dead!

<i>ploop!!!</i>
=====================================

<font color = white>&#34; you see...y-you see...a-ahem..you see...the reason why the mushroom couldnt counter you is because of they way the order of attacks work in this world. Perhaps made this way by the shogan himself. &#34;</font> She found herself..pausing breifly..before speaking once more.

<font color = white>&#34;Shurikenjutsu happens..first...and taijutsu happened after it mhm...however it expands to something more...as after a bit of experimentation and a few lost lifes of our iwagakurian shinobi...we have a detailed list..to make it easier for the newer generation&#34;</font>

Reaching into her pocket...she held up a piece of paper for them to read off of.

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Sorry, I was teasing you.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'm Shuye.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: T-That was a really long con... Nice to meet you though Shuye, I'm Hideo.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: I heard. Child of the vessel, right?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Uhuh!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Big expectations.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah no kidding... Should be easy to meet them though!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sup.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yo Fubuki.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Anything interesting happen?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Other than my dreams of owning a sword, or something equally cool, being crushed nah.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Swords will come and go.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: You also want to own a sword?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had been spaced out staring at the water and didn&#39;t realize Shuye approached him. Spacing back in he spins around to continue talking to her without being rude.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, with they&#39;d actually ever come though. They&#39;re like several bajillion ryo...&#34;</font>

He then looks to Fubuki and shrugs,

<font color = white>&#34;I just wanted to buy something shiny to be honest.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. Well, I'm only five hundred ryo short for a katana, thanks to Hana.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: That's pretty cheap for a sword.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I-It is?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah. The ones in this village's shop are like, eight thousand.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Wait- Who's Hana?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: A thousand ryo...? I'm not even a ninja and have half that.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Maaaaan why does everyone have more money than I do?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh, a friend I met. She gave me money.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wish my friends would give me money...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: At least you have friends. That is a different sort of wealth.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) ears quirk up at the sound of &#39;buy something shiny&#39;.

With a overdramatic backflip from the arena, she lands next to the red-haired boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Well let me show you my wares!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed.

Her hands came together, a loud clap echoing out, before she withdraws her hands apart towards either side of her. As her hands stretched out, shimmering pink crystals formed, making unique patterns along the way until she&#39;d finally reached as far as she could.
 <font color = white>&#34;Just fifty Ryo and I&#39;ll make a shiny object of your choice!&#34;</font>

Was she attempting to scam children? Yes. Did she care? Absolutely not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) is a little too wise-- or perhaps, more accurately, a little too jaded, to fall for this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) sloooowly turns to face Kitsumi. Clearly not having forgotten how quick she was to pawn the work of repairing the gate and stairs off on literally anyone else. His eyes narrow, staring at her for a moment. However he&#39;s immediately distracted by the crystals. His brain was smooth and the rocks were pretty.

<font color = white>&#34;A shiny object of my choice?! Out of crystal right? That&#39;d be awesome...&#34;</font>

He cups his chin in his hand and begins pondering what to ask for. Eventually snapping his fingers and holding out fifty ryo to the Shingen.

<font color = white>&#34;I want a crystal monkey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hideo, you want money yet you spend it on this?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Just... make him a mirror...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: What's the point of having money if I don't spend it- Shuye are you suggesting I'm a monkey?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But you're always complaining about money, maybe save a little first...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) scowled externally, and smiled internally. Silence and eye contact is the answer.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm not *complaining* about money! I just *want* money. There's a difference!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. I guess then, fair enough.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And I want money so that I can spend it! Spending money makes me feel better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) continued flipping through his book.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What do you want to spend it on though? Just anything?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean, anything that's cool yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Liiiike a crystal monkey!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Should have got a rock-candy monkey.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I don't think she can make rock-candy... But that does sound awesome!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) gave a nod in response before clasping her hands together once again. All the crystals she&#39;d formed turned into nothing but sparkles in the air as her hands met.
 <font color = white>&#34;Of course!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed once again, the prospect of profit clearly warranting more energy out of the normally aloof girl.

As her hands began pulling apart, a Curious George-esque monkey formed within her palms, shimmering against the sunlight. Little by little it came together, its slightly larger than body head forming first, followed by its body and limbs, until finally she added a little curved tail at the end.

Extending her hand out, she offered the piece to the boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now, my crystals are resistant to near everything in such compact form, so breaking it should be hard!... UnlessIdiebutthenwe&#39;reallscrewed.&#34;</font>, she finished with a bright smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) &#39;s eyes light up as Kitsumi begins. Watching with awe as the little paperweight takes shape. Mumbling to no one in particular as she works,

<font color = white>&#34;Maaan manipulating crystals is so cool...&#34;</font>

Taking the monkey, he holds it up toward the sun. Turning it around in the air and simply looking at the sparkles.

<font color = white>&#34;This is awesome!&#34;</font>

Then his ears perk up at the claim of it being extremely durable. A clear mental battle is fought as he resists the urge to drop it or rap a knuckle against it to test her claim. For a moment he wonder if she was actualyl lying and the complete opposite was true-

What if this thing was super fragile!

He carefully lowers it, now holding it in both hands. He nods to Kitsumi and says,

<font color = white>&#34;This is super cool. Thank you Kitsumi. Worth fifty ryo...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Of course! I'm available from nine-to-five on weekdays.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I-Isn't that just your normal shinobi hours?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Yep!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) taps the side of her head a few times.
 <font color = white>&#34;Smarter not harder.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched the display from the front row. Honestly, she was expecting it to be a total scam. It wasn't. The jounin was a surprisingly talented sculptor, and Hideo seemed very pleased by the item he received, too. If it was true that it wouldn't break...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) shook his head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Sounds like you have too much free time even when on duty...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat! Nooooooooo...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) leans forward towards the boy, gripping his shirt.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Guh-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) goes for a swim.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers: You ever say that outloud again and I'll toss you into a wall..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) releases the boy and smiles.
 <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m always busy!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Y-Yeah super busy! The busiest!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: . . . . .
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) would look towards his left to see a man with the massive burn scar on the right side of his body, it looked extremely painful and all he could think about was how narley it was.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder how he could of gotten something like that...&#34;</font> he whispered to himself as he was looking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Anyways! Anyone else want a crystal of their choice?! Only fifty-ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: No thanks, I'm saving money for a sword.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Are you selling crystals to the kids.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) asks: uhh what can you make?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Himeki! Do you want a crystal thingy from Kitsumi? I'll pay for it!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Maybe! And I can make mostly anything! The larger it is, the less durable it is, though!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Im pretty sure you dont need the money Kitsumi, boy Its Sensei Kitsumi to you. It's like you dont have any good upbringing.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat... I totally need the Ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She hasn't even taught me anything though! Tch, not my sensei...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Feel free to hit him over the head, Kitsumi.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Well.. If you're learning Doton or Shurikenjutsu, I'm your girl! If it's anything else, I'm clueless!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Dad no!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) reaches out and bonks the child over the head.

No missed opportunities to bully children.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately drops down. Squatting and moving to hold a hand against the spot he&#39;d been hit. Sucking air through his teeth as he mumbles,

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhhtatatata...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: This is a fight you cannot win.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Another dent in his skull. Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-Not another one...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Lucky it was Kitsumi who hit you and not me.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: I am rather noodle-army!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I bet you hit like an old man these days...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Silently positioned by a tree, observing others present with a tired demeanor, the reticent young boy made use of a small mirror to peer into the deepening bags under his eyes.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) asks: Old man?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: T-That wasn't supposed to be outloud...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Just throw yourself in the moat.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It won't save me...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He's dead.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I wonder if I could crystalize the whole moat with you guys in it...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead its much better than the lump thats about to form on your head.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Jump in the moat for me right quick...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Can I take off my clothes first?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Soggy socks are the worst...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uh... That's up to your dad not me. You might catch a cold, or something I'dunno.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: . . . .
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'll hold the monkey for you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Thank you Shuye.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) looked like a wreck, with the sun looming over Iwagakure, blinding the child. It's easy to assume that the child doesn't get out much. Blinking twice in a slow manner, the pocket mirror is placed away into a pouch as the 5'3 child continues to watch the proceedings of those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) flickered towards his son, kicking up a gentle waft of dust, before kicking him into the water with a sideways kick.

<font color = white>&#34;Just get in the water you bastard&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) was in the process of holding out the crystalline monkey to Shuye as he&#39;s kicked in the chest. A pathetic grunt is shouted out as he is sent straight into the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Guh!&#34;</font>

Unfortunately he was a big kid and his clothes were now soaked. So rather than simply swim back to edge like a normal person; he flailed around helplessly for a few seconds. Splashing water everywhere and toward all those nearby. Before eventually realizing the moat wasn&#39;t very deep.

And remembering that he could walk on water. With a sigh he plants his hands on the surface of the water and pulls himself up and out. Shaking in place like a dog, trying to get rid of at least some of the water. Which, was almost entirely futile.

Grumbling to himself he returns to his spot and glares at his father.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to call me a bastard too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) asks: Hey, Mugen. On a scale of one-to-ten, how cool do you think a crystal statue of him would be?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Is there a Negative? option.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I can't believe you'd say that about your eldest son...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Your only son!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Whats tewelve more years, make another one. Start again.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Y-You wouldn't...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: We can seal him away, Mugen.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Just say the word...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Please don't...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) The boy was gone before she could blink. Before the wind hit the back of her kimono from the man's movement. He was in the water before the surface tension broke and bubbled. But still, Shuye had her hands out, and managed to catch the monkey before it fell to the ground. Would it have shattered? Probably not. But they didn't need to know.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) smiles brightly as she holds up a single seal. In that very moment, the ground beneath Hideo would begin to crystalize, slowly crawling up his legs.

Well, slowly to her. To him? It was a near instant encapsulation!

As it finally reached up to his neck, she stopped the crystals and turned to Mugen.
 <font color = white>&#34;Tada!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) sips the moat water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) looks down at the crystals growing beneath him. Quickly looking toward Kitsumi he shout,

<font color = white>&#34;No! Release me! I command y-&#34;</font>

Before being cut off and entombed in a gemstone prison. His smooth brain now perfectly immoratlized in crystaline form.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Blankly staring at the iron vessel and the pale-skinned girl, the child only had the energy to blink in a lazy manner, with cruelty on full display. Getting involved might result in their scandalous activities being directed towards him after all.

As crystals crept up Hideo's frame, the reticent young boy confirmed their insanity, taking solace in the natural concealment offered by the bark of the rather large tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The lumberjack, jack-Kristuria) begins to tirelessly swing a large axe at the tree before him. He didn't have a permit and this was illegal.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) taps the frozen statue of his son, with a finger tentatively, considering how long he should leave him like that.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uhm...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Probably not!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) retracts the crystals just enough to free his nose.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now he can!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Ah good.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately inhales sharply. His nostrils flaring as he breathes. And, while he couldn't move his jaw, he could shit spew a stream of expletives. Granted the sound comes out of his nose as a garbled grunt that was completely incomprehensible. But it made him feel better.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: I think he likes it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: AHOUKINGAOLESEEIEOU!

With a quiet sigh, he barks to the reticent young boy. <font color = white>&#34;Come on, we didn’t travel all the way from Akhibara just for you to shy away. Meet your peers, make some friends, you’re back home now.&#34;</font>

He approaches the boy hiding behind the tree, mostly obscured. The man had very excellent hearing though, and could tell just who was behind there. <font color = white>&#34;Don’t be afraid of them&#34;</font> he says aloud whilst thinking &#39;they should probably be afraid of you&#39;

He motions forward, <font color = white>&#34;come on, Hitoshi. You’ll need to make friends so we can get you a proper squad after graduation&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I didn't expect that from you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked at the two toned headed youth, withaa puzzled expression. He wanted to torture people? The jounin simply shook his head and returned his attention towards his crystalized son.

<font color = white>&#34;Well did you learn your lesson&#34;</font>?,he asked with a smirk on his face, awaiting the boys response.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: So... should I...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Put the monkey down...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) held it awkwardly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: It's not mine.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Released dread into the atmosphere, metaphorically dampening the air with its mere presence alone. The tired, cold eyes of the hiding boy peered from around the bark. They had become engaged with the Iwa guards. How did the guard ever surmise that the reticent boy happened to be positioned behind the tree?

Shifting a defeated and exhausted gaze to the floor, a steady flow of air is sucked through the hiding one's nostrils. Coming out from behind the tree, the 5'3 boy became more visible, appearing to be frail dressed in comfy clothes and sporting unkempt hair.

No words were offered to the Iwagakure guard, even if the child obliged their request.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: OIinoearnmesson. Ourolansmea. Sueleaseumoneyown.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) looks behind him and would see a kid hiding behind a tree; assuming he was shy and hearing what the Iwa Gaurd he&#39;d think about introducing himself and saying hI to the other kid.

Getting up from where he was sitting he&#39;d walk towards the other kid, Kuro was scratching his face a bit while looking at the other kid. <font color = white>&#34;hey that tree doesn&#39;t give much cover, you should try a wall.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say before laughing a bit trying to be funny and trying to lighten things up. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kuro, and you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) could only continue to aggressively mumble through his nose in response to his father and Shuye.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked towards the scowling red eye girl. 
<font color = white>&#34;Monkey&#34;</font>?,he asked her with a tilt of his head, rasing his fist and cracking open the crystal prison which held his son captive.

<font color = white>&#34;Where did you get a monkey lassie&#34;</font>?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) says: Damn.. I heard a rumor some guy got encased in crystal..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It's crazy how that strength doesn't even break the crystal..)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was indeed holding a crystal monkey. It wasn&#39;t that big, but it wasn&#39;t small either. She looked to the pale-skinned girl, then at her victim and the man&#39;s son.

<font color = white>&#34;Hideo bought it from her.&#34;</font> She answered, matter-of-factly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) blinks awkwardly as Mugen&#39;s hand slams against her Crystal.

<br><font color=green>*Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) says: Rumors sure do travel fast..

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You're not wrong. At the speed of light, really.
<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (It's A+ power)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) continues shouting through his nose. Now, clearly laughing, as his father's hand hits the crystal and fails to break it. Granted the laughing sounds more like a struggling wheeze as his chest couldn't really move to breathe enough to properly laugh.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Iwa Guard (The masked guard-ChainsOfMadness) looks at the young boy with a smile, though it wouldn’t be seen behind the mask

<font color = white>&#34;Much better, I’ve got some duties to run but you be good now. And no…losing control ya?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) releases the poor boy from his crystal prison. A smile present on her face as she did.
 <font color = white>&#34;Did you have fun?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) loudly gasps as if he hadn&#39;t been able to breathe for the past few minutes. Given that his chest couldn&#39;t actually expand at all his breathing had been really shallow. But now he was free!

He leans forward, planting his hands on his knees as he pants for a few moments. Shaking his head and mumbling,

<font color = white>&#34;That totally sucked...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (and they said shingen aint shit fr

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Squinting as sunlight once again harasses his irises, Hitoshi's vision returns and he is met by a boy with one eye covered. As the fellow approaches, they are met with a gaze capable of piercing the soul directly. Kuro ridiculed the reticent one's stealth capability. Unsure of what to do now, the young, frail boy contemplated fleeing.

It's true, to be an exemplary shinobi required a squad, alongside the respect and admiration of fellow Iwagakurens. With a chilling silence, all that's offered is a nod. It's one of acknowledgment.

Kuro and Hitoshi were now best friends.
 Right?</font></font></font>

He will grab two small bandaids,then place a fabric to the wound and keep it with the two bandaids.After the treatment was done he will simply wait for the unconcious person to awake,afterall he did what he can with his basic knowledge of the human body</font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;It hasn&#39;t finished, so many people seemed to vanish,&#34;</font>

She then shifted towards the young Student, her hand easing back to nestle the hilt of a massive blade adorned across her back. An Odachi of gigantic mass, and weight yet she eased back once she realized what was about to occur. 

She had no reason to inflict lasting harm, not now but perhaps later.

   <font color = white>&#34;I forgive you,&#34;</font>

A cold-stir of words, and she moved to extend her hand and SLAM it into her stomach much as she had done someone else earlier today. A brief adjustment in behavior if anything. 

She then moved to ease back towards her spot, and her hand pushed back behind her back to meet the other one.

The sentiment didn&#39;t sit right with her. Instead of suggesting she nab the shoes off of another, the Hozuki opts to disprove the notion right then and there. Just as she was about to go dig up some sharp gravel for the girl to walk across, her attention was stolen by a blurred movement nearby.

By the time she got her eyes centered on the dancer, their fist had already connected, leaving her to watch in awe as the student, presumably, buckled and fell from the weight behind the strike.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) knew that the moment following the slip of her tongue were simply the calm before the storm.
    As the muscular, odachi wielding shinobi approached her Nahoko remained as silent and as still as possible. Perhaps somewhere in the back of her mind she thought that if she didn&#39;t move or make a sound she wouldn&#39;t be the nail that got hammered.

   Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case as the act of the elder shinobi&#39;s fist slamming into her stomache at a speed far exceeding her contention instantly caused her to double over in agony.
       A few dry heaves reverberated through the area as an intense, burning pain spread through the girl&#39;s body in relation to the action.

<font color = white>&#34;T-that...scratched my itch.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) sharp eyes clock the lightning fast punch from afar, yet she failed to see when it was released..

She stared onwards with a blank look in her face. The words of Najiro snapping her out of it. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. huh? What&#39;s up Naji.&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I am glad to be of service.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) There&#39;s a familiarity in the dashing that takes place. In the instant that the blow connects with the fellow-blonde&#39;s stomach, her own hand moves to protect her gut.

     <font color = white>&#34;B-Believe me.. She&#39;s not walkin&#39; that off easily..&#34;</font> she comments absently, her palm nursing a freshly mended wound.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You missed some stuff happening recently
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The reconstruction of the bridge...the village announcement..that...weird commander.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: With that, I have a few small things to say.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh, did I? I took a trip with my parents to pray at a shrine. I was gone a few days.

They asked, looking at a small scroll in their hand that they had found in the library.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm? Perhaps Bill, once we have taught you all a few techniques.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: That sounds personal.

They said to the chuunin as their gaze roamed the different faces gathered around this point of the village. Many he knew, but there were also some strangers whose names escaped him, a reminder of the ever-expanding community they were a part of.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: See, Botan, I agree. I prefer using large weapons to club m'opponents, personally.

Such a hold caused a cry to escape from his body. Yelping across the yard in a state of pure panic.

She released the hold on his face, a very <i>light</i> push of his cheek aimed to send him a step or two away.

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Log?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Huh.&#34;</font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) quickly moved to do as she had done before, and produced a singular shiny-metallic item from within her sleeve. This time? It was a Shuriken, a singular Shuriken - it wasn&#39;t much but it was still free.

She handed it over.

blinked.
blinked.

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) places her right hand on her chin and her left hand behind her back, quickly weaving a half seal with the hidden hand.

The veins, arteries and capilaries around her eyes bulge and slowly move across her face adorning them with jagged lines of raised skin. As her already sharp eagle eyes, awaken to their true state.

<font color = white>&#34;These are called Chakra nodes or Tenketsu.&#34;</font> As she spoke Higane, pointed straight towards Botan, her finger perfectly aimed at the Chunin&#39;s Tenketsu points.

<font color = white>&#34;The three most vital.. Hmm.. I&#39;d say the ones near the brain, heart and lungs.. Unless you mean the actual chakra gates, thats a different story!&#34;</font> She&#39;d say in a serious tone, not unlike her usual comments.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (how do i do half seals)

   <font color = white>&#34;That is correct, and for extra credit - what happens when you break these gates and allow Chakra to flow uncontrolled?,&#34;</font>

She had already moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve, but which weapon would she decide upon?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: Break the wha now yo?
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Boom?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) scans the Chunins body, scrutinizing her chakra network with the aid of the Byakugan. <font color = white>&#34;Hm..An interesting theory.. If possible, but that sounds like a fairy tale..  I&#39;ve never read about any of that in the medical books I&#39;ve sto-- I mean, borrowed.&#34;</font>

She&#39;d then slowly ponder the question for a few brief moments before offering a respone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d gues in theory, the gates would no longer impede the flow of chakra, allowing for its unrestricted flow.. So perhaps an increase in power?..&#34;</font> She&#39;d rationalyse the proposed theory.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hmm...Higane i got a question
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you can touch any tenketsu point
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why no hyuuga strikes the heart?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) smirked.

   <font color = white>&#34;That would be quite correct, unrestricted flow would allow someone to unleash the full length of their abilities unhindered,&#34;</font>

That young Hyuuga would see nothing out of the normal, outside the fact that her network was quite a raging wildfire of intensely flowing energy. She held her own secrets - and the network never lied. 

   <font color = white>&#34;In theory,&#34;</font>

A moment and her hand was presented, with -two- Senbon. They were tossed towards her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or any very lethal tenketsu point.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) catches the senbon with ease, tucking them inbetween her fingers as if she&#39;d practice it a thousand times before..

The vessels around her eyes relax as her Byakugan deactivates. <font color = white>&#34;I see.. Huh..&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment, tucking the senbon into her medic pouch.

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I&#39;d known you were gonna ask me about anatomy and stuff I&#39;d volunteer first! Miss Botan..!&#34;</font> She&#39;d jest returning to her playful demeanor as she backs off with a whistle.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: guess you won't answer that then.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Striking such a small point within a high speed close quarters situtation has its issues.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) yells: See I knew Higane was smart! She's got the biggest brain by far! Ya fool!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: And, I have a variety of questions Higane.

It's clear he's not here to dominate or assert himself overtly but rather to understand and strategize.

He feels the weight of someone's gaze upon him, a piercing stare trying to draw his attention. Keeping his arms folded across his chest, he remains outwardly composed, his expression unreadable.

His gaze drifts off into the distance, not directly meeting the source of the glare but aware of its presence. The atmosphere around him buzzes with energy, conversations blending into a low hum that he tunes out effortlessly. Sogeki's mind wanders briefly, contemplating the day's events and the tasks ahead.

Then, a movement catches his eye—a flicker of motion on the edge of the training ground. It's an interaction he hasn't seen before, unfolding with intrigue and curiosity. Intrigued, Sogeki's focus shifts, his analytical mind now fully engaged as he observes with a keen interest, temporarily forgetting the lingering sensation of someone's scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: You should use these skills on girls. It's a free excuse to touch them.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I am Commander, refer to me as nothing but that.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki's gaze sharpened as he recognized the familiar aura—sharp, unyielding, like a blade slicing through the air. It was the stern bastard from a few days ago, the one who dared to challenge him openly. Without shifting his stance, Sogeki turned his attention towards the source of the voice, his eyes fixing on the shark-like boy.

Their eyes locked in a silent duel, each assessing the other with unspoken intensity. Sogeki's stare was icy, piercing, as if daring the other to meet his gaze head-on. He conveyed a silent challenge through his unwavering glare, a message of defiance and readiness to engage if provoked.

Despite the tension, Sogeki remained composed, arms folded across his chest, exuding an air of quiet confidence. He waited, patient yet vigilant, observing how the sharkboy would react under his unwavering scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;No. I good. Nope.&#34;</font>
Dropping down to the ground and curling up in to a ball. Beginning to roll away.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Higane, help.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the veteran,the commander, as they spoke, and he wondered what fate they had just doomed his peer to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stared blankly at Sogeki. He pushed his glasses up, the sunlight glinting off the lenses dramatically. He pointed, positioning his body sideways. <font color = white>&#34;You act like a robot. I&#39;d fight you now but alas...&#34;</font> He tilted is head down sadly, <font color = white>&#34;I am without shoes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was being chased?! This was no good. His rolling wasn&#39;t taking him far.
<font color = white>&#34;New plan.&#34;</font>

He was going to do the most unstoppable means of escape. Springing out of his ball form and then going completely still. Like a...like uhh...-like a STATUE!!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) The squint didn&#39;t leave Sogeki&#39;s face. The embedding threat that stands before him.. it rocks Sogeki&#39;s core. Naturally, he&#39;s shaking in his boots.. But he refuses to dishonor the Satetsu name by back down.

Sogeki stands strong-- and steps forward even stronger.

The aggressive lad accepts his fate.
  <font color = white>&#34;Ready to accept my consequences. I simply allow for at least a two on one opportunity. I wish for my father to recognize my body after this.. Commander.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) approaches Sogeki and settles a large hand on their shoulder, his figure towering them easily. <font color = white>&#34;My soldiers do <i>not</i> yield. But I admire such personality.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The hunt will be retracted. Tell me your name.
