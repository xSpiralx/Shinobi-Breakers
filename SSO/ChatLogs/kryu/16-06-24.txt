<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Hozuki, Kryu has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s relentless stride towards Higane slows as her words cut through the air, piercing his focus like a well-aimed blade. Her snicker and taunt reach him clearly, igniting a flicker of irritation in his eyes that he struggles to conceal behind a mask of stoicism.

He hears her accusations about his demeanor, about not understanding what it means to be revered, to carry the weight of expectations. For a moment, Sogeki&#39;s gaze intensifies with a silent challenge, his jaw tensing imperceptibly.

<font color = white>&#34;You think I don&#39;t know pressure?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice is low, carrying a hint of raw intensity. <font color = white>&#34;Being at the top means everyone&#39;s watching, waiting for you to slip. It&#39;s a different kind of pressure, one that fuels me.&#34;</font>

His demeanor shifts subtly, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. <font color = white>&#34;But that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, isn&#39;t it? To show them all who stands at the pinnacle.&#34;</font> His tone is nonchalant yet laced with confidence, his eyes locking onto Higane&#39;s with a calculated glare.

Despite her faltering stance, Sogeki remains cautious, sensing an opportunity amidst her wavering resolve. His own pride and determination drive him forward, pushing him to capitalize on the moment and assert his dominance once more.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirks. <font color = white>&#34;You going to give up again Najiro?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;You think thats bad? Having no monetary support by your father so you can get anything and everything? Tsk,tsk..Perhaps for you is bad,afterall you are spoiled since birth.

But let me say it again,what you experience at this moment...is what everyone NORMAL experience.You want your stuff? earn it.Do you think your old man got the money out of nowhere? That they didn&#39;t struggled? Or your ancestor didn&#39;t struggle? Cause let me tell you something..Without your father,and your ancestors trying their best...you would had been just like us,another small family member of a family which isn&#39;t noble,Neither anyone cares to know their name all around their town.&#34;</font>They will pause afterwhich will continue

<font color = white>&#34;So prove yourself as senju and earn what you belive is your right to have.The other option it to beg your old man untill he dies.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) moving to get in front of the rest he would use himself as a shield to deflect any attacks coming.

<font color = white>&#34;Get back everyone.&#34;</font>

Seeing His partner go on the offensive he would do the same. Watching to make sure the students did not do anything risky he would prepare to use a jutus on the enemy if he moved to attack the students.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: What the heck is this?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as he took in the scene before him. The strange scientist with his unsettling presence and the scattered headbands spoke of a dangerous situation. His mind raced, assessing the potential threat and calculating his next move. Despite the scientist's eerie demeanor and the implied threat, Sogeki's stance remained firm and his expression unreadable, masking any fear or concern beneath a veneer of cold resolve.

He knew that action would be required, but for now, Sogeki chose to observe, gathering crucial information and waiting for the right moment to strike. His hand subtly moved towards a concealed weapon, prepared for any sudden developments. In the face of uncertainty and danger, Sogeki's instincts honed in, ready to protect himself and his comrades from whatever this mysterious threat might bring.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) stared at the scientist blankly for several moments, the unnerving intensity in his eyes making her deeply uncomfortable. There was a disturbing aura about him, a level of psychosis that was palpable and chilling.



     As a nervous tick, she ran her fingers through her golden locks while her gaze never wavered  as she regarded the bizarre individual who had just issued a dire warning.



<font color = white>&#34;So, let me get this straight,&#34;</font> she began, her tone laced with sarcasm and a hint of defiance. <font color = white>&#34;If we venture into the wilderness, you&#39;re planning to abduct us and transform us into some sort of grotesque and depraved creature such as yourself? Is that what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</font>

She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper,  ashs he  mockingly stated. <font color = white>&#34;Because if that&#39;s your idea of a threat, you might want to reconsider your approach.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) begins to shift and rattle. What seemed to be skin and bone was flipping and turning, to reveal a number of mechanisms. His back and arms twist and fold, and his body launches to the side with a number of mechanical creaks.

His head twists around in a three-hundred and sixty degree spiral before it swivels to face the two true Jonin. The body pieces separate and folding, allowing him to immediately slip out of the grasp of the incoming tackle.

<font color = white>&#34;We seek information, but not at the cost of warning. I’ve not come to attack, today, I’m nothing more than an embassy for words today&#34;</font>

The water off to the side begins to ripple, only noticeable by those with attuned senses or abilities such as a Byakugan. While another presence couldn’t be seen though, it could be felt. A chakra system very vaguely seen, almost as if invisible but not.

<font color = white>&#34;Power doesn’t lie in your village, it lies with us. Keep this...&#34;</font> he glances to the two Jonin, <font color = white>&#34;in mind, kids.&#34;</font> He begins to pull off, backing up from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;I bring your missing headbands as a gesture. Now, assuming you want to keep them and your lives, I think I’ll be going...&#34;</font> his beady, glass eyes, looking back and forth between the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;And if not, then we could all just...<b><i>go</b></i>&#34;</font> he begins to launch manically as he cast his eyes down to the bridge.

A bridge lined up with hundreds of explosive tags. <font color = white>&#34;If you catch my drift&#34;</font> one of the eyes winks. <font color = white>&#34;But you won’t have time to battle me and save them&#34;</font> A hand begins to form into a symbol, priming the tags but not setting them off.with only a matter of seconds at hand, would the perpetrator find battle? Or would the kids find rescue?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Shion! Protect!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) looked left, then right. Blinked a few times and quickly realized she was in a situaiton way above her pay grade.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhhh...oh SHIT! RUN!&#34;</font> she exclaimed before cartoonishly scamping northwards towards the end of the bridge before she was turned into a living firework.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;So you come here...say its your territory,and decide to blow up the bridge filled with kids.You truly are evil..aren&#39;t you?&#34;</font>He will say,at somewhat of monotone way,like he was not even shocked at this point</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) quickly scanned the area and took note of his colleagues. He felt an ominous presence but couldn&#39;t quite make it out. As one of the scientist&#39;s hands began forming a symbol, his heart dropped. For a split second, he felt frozen before his adrenaline dumped. <font color = white>&#34;We need to GO!&#34;</font> he said, trying to stir the others to action.</font></font></font>

His instincts kick in sharply. With a quick assessment of the surroundings and the looming danger, he darts to the side, his movements swift and agile as he attempts to evade the potential blast radius.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</font> Sogeki mutters under his breath, adrenaline coursing through him. He doesn&#39;t engage with the scientist directly, realizing the immediate need to prioritize the safety of himself and the others. His mind races with thoughts of escape routes and strategies to mitigate the imminent threat without escalating the situation further.

As he moves swiftly away from the danger zone, Sogeki&#39;s gaze flickers back towards the scientist and the assembled Jonin. His expression is a mix of frustration and determination, knowing that the situation has escalated beyond a mere confrontation. With a resolve to regroup and strategize further, he gestures urgently for the others to follow suit, seeking cover and safety from the unfolding chaos.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) jumps forward, placing himself behind the grotesque form before him, threatening to hurt the new generation of shinobi. The Hyuuga was a proud man, believing himself to be the strongest- but he was not foolhardy enough to assume he could both protect and attack at the same time.

In times like this, Matsu knew he could rely on the blessed vessel of the tailed beast. He relinquished all thought of defence and went on an immediate offence. He landing with a heavy thud, poised to attack.

A fraction of a second passed.

A large circle seemed to appear below him and the soon-to-be corpse. Before that very same second ended, Matsu had began a flurry of blows.

<font color = white>&#34;Juukenho!&#34;</font> He shouted, as he delivered two blows. Immediately he delivered 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64 blows! <font color = white>&#34;Hakka Hyaku Bijuhanaho!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;l help patch up anyone I can..&#34;</font> She spoke out, removing her medic pouch and bringing out a few simple supplies.

Gauze, trauma scizors, antiseptic solution and a few pieces of non-stick tape. <font color = white>&#34;Najiro care to help me patch anyone up? At least the simple injuries.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) finishes his flurry of blows, reducing the puppeted corpse to a pile of organs and mechanical bits. Soon as he begins to reer back for a second attack, the remains seem to glow bright and hot. A moment later, the explosion comes.

The muscular man tries to shield his face but is blasted backwards. He has enough sense to force a roll and lands on one knee, bleeding from various cuts- and his own hands covered in someone else&#39;s blood.

He stands, realizing the attack was over. He spits the saliva and blood from his mouth, not seeming to care that he just battered a child&#39;s corpse.

Though it went undetected, the academy student would shift his left foot enough to form a fluid stance, should he be forced to engage in combat. 

Remaining silent he continued to eye the figures on the bridge, absorbing as much information as possible despite the lack of context in their coded-language. Should any of the senior shinobi take notice, the boy was display many analylitical skills commonly displayed by interrogators. 

Retaining as much information as possible, the child continue to make mental notes.</font></font></font>

Moving over towards the edge of the water, he'd begin to gather his thoughts, slowly dissecting the details gathered from the event. </font></font></font>

She was gingerly eating it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm,&#34;</font>

She was just watching.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: thats true.But i will say it once more,you should know when to give up
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Before you decide to give up, you must first figure out what you truly fight for.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eyes rolled as he saw things were starting to steer out of control, <font color = white>&#34;Well I was thinking we should scout for grounds fitting to hold ugernt meetings, like grounds for voting and such... does anyone have any suggestions?&#34;</font>

It would be nice to have a location where everyone from the village is aware of and considered a safe ground for other to take refugee.

<font color = white>&#34;Anyone here have a suggestion?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Coward is someone who didn't even tried to attack.Giving up based on what you see is the right choice at times.

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Otherwise, I believe we are using the statue here or the area outside the Kage Building.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you have scrolls about the water walking jutsu? Is seems some students know the technique.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Class Leader? You should be looking to form squads, and figuring out a squad leader.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Suimen? Hm, I've never really used it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Also...isn't forming squads the job of chunins and jounins?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: But, we may have a few scrolls - you didn't ask them?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) shook his head, he was simply implaying as a community, they should decided on one that is per-say official.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Most likely,&#34;</font>

She replied, and motioned towards the nearby edge of the raised platform they were all stood upon. 

   <font color = white>&#34;But alas,&#34;</font>

She extended a hand - a simple motion and she weaved out a singular seal before she eased forth and motioned to fall from the edge. A softly thud of impact noted, and a visible hue of blue rippled from below her feet. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Like so,&#34;</font>

She shrugged. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Now let me write this down...,&#34;</font>

She quickly produced a small black-scroll from within her attire, and with agile grace, and speed she invoked the wrath of her newly obtained knowledge within the confines of it all. 

It didn&#39;t take long, and before she knew it? She was now standing within her space once more.</font></font></font>
