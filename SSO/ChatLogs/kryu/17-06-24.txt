<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) release a heavy sigh as he began to notice more and more less students were attending class, was the village's structure beginning to collapse?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Well hello there
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Oh you mest be resting... I suppose I'll see you around
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) stepped off and continued to explore the village, in search of a few of the familiar faces he'd seen earlier in the week.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Hozuki, Kryu has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: So this is where everyone is

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: So..does anyone wanna play that dice game of 200?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: No money betting.Just for fun.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) shook his head, <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t gamble, I seen someone lose it all from his addition.&#34;</font> 

The boy could remember how much his father&#39;s rage when he lost a round in blackjack, and how frequently he went out drink to cope with his failed winnings. 

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, sorry... I try to steer aware from anything that feels like gambling&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I see..

<font color = white>&#34;How about a game of hidden?&#34;</font> Where someone counts and everyone hides.&#34;
he suggested after releasing his chin as his hand fell down to his side.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Too easy for me.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Yeah, are you a student?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: I am.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pauses. A finger juts out towards the reserved one on the bench.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns her hand. She flexes the fingers to make a &#39;gimme&#39; gesture.

     <font color = white>&#34;Your shoes. I need &#39;em.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Shoes?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) pulled off the shoes and toss them into the waterway.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Wh--
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: That should clean them.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: They got dirt and grim, just let it sit for a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Isn't the current just going to take them away?!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: You just.. suddenly go deaf or something?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Both of you.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) gestures a hand toward the blue-skinned boy. <font color = white>&#34;Beat him. You may take his shoes too.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) yells: ...?!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) looked confused as he manage to fall into a daze. <font color = white>&#34;Oh no this time of day the current isn&#39;t strung.&#34;</font> he replied.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) diverts her attention from the now shoeless reserved youth. Her eyes rest on the blue-skinned boy, primarily towards the shoes he adorns.

     <font color = white>&#34;..You ready?&#34;</font> she inquires.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) jumped up to face the stature of the crimson-haired vet and gave a salute. <font color = white>&#34;Eh... good day sir!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good day. You may refer to me as Commander. Nothing else.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) keeps his hands behind his back and steps away to the side. <font color = white>&#34;You may begin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Well I suppose I must follow orders.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Forgive me... for this...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) sprinted forward towards the hoshigaki while launching a senbon toothpick in his direction. Hopefully it was enough to throw him off-guard as he begun his assault.

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Well, he wants me to beat up *anyone* for a pair.. but most people are asleep. He said if I don't, I'll get reprimanded.

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ...Because I don't wear any.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) shrugs off the incoming senbon with a side step. He backs up, breaking into a sprint towards the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Aye, cousin,&#34;</font> he says eyeing the white-haired sharkling nearby. <font color = white>&#34;Keep the blonde gal busy, would ya? I&#39;ll explain what&#39;s really going on later.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) release a deep sigh as it seem none of this was going to be and easy task. Though he didn&#39;t understand why he was task with the duty of retrieving a set of shoes that could easily be replaced by a purchase from the local store. Advancing on the hoshigaki&#39;s position he&#39;d bellow, <font color = white>&#34;Just give use the shoe and we can end this...what size are you?&#34;</font>

Another toothpick was fired at the hosigaki&#39;s ankles. If he was lucky it would strike him in the bunions.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice, looking between his friend to his cousin. A crazy predicament. Though, she looked to not be inclined to join the scuffle - so he saw little to really <i>do</i>.

Though, this kid beating on his cousin gave him a sour taste in his mouth. With that at the least - he felt as if it was on his shoulders to at least try to deter this. His poncho being unlatched, Jinbeisame sighed, his mouth opening to speak, <font color = white>&#34;D&#39;you need help handling that little one?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) hadn&#39;t really moved. While she was given an order, she also wasn&#39;t exactly the kind of person to jump someone. That and, well, she&#39;d just prefer to attack <i>someone else altogether</i>.

She gives her friend&#39;s glance a returned side-eye, though a smile quickly flashes onto her face.

     <font color = white>&#34;He should be fine! If he wins, then I&#39;ll probably have to do something. If not, well..&#34;</font> As per usual?

She shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Meh, I could jus' help you strong-arm someones shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Preferably not my cousin's, but yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: There were a bunch of people around earlier but they were all half asleep..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu(The reserved boy-Kryu) OOCs: (my turn to RP right?

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Maybe uh - ten or so minutes ago.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: That little.. That just means he tried ignoring me earlier!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: You've gotta show me where!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sure, he should still be over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) continued with his pursuit with the intent of closing the distance. It wasn't like he wanted to engage in combat. Infact it was under the order of the jounin to collect the shoes. However anyone absent when the order was given would have lost the contexts of the fiasco. 

Sprinting forward in sporactic manner, another flick of the wrist had sent another toothpick forward. If only he'd learn some suiton jutsu... maybe then he'd be able to bring this foolish chance to an end.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) Their answer was that final straw for the blonde. Her hands moved from their pointing, relaxed positions and instead dropped to her side. Just like the day(s) prior, they slowly began to curl themselves into fists. She took a singular step forward, the wraps around her soles pressing against the concrete.

     <font color = white>&#34;Just don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you an out, runt!&#34;</font>

It takes only a jolt for her to take off into a full fledged sprint. Step after step is made in dangerous approach of the youthful one. With her target locked, there wasn&#39;t exactly anything going to stop her from making her way over to them.

Just how would they respond?</font></font></font>

With the stealthy talents of the mask figure, he could easily places it in the shadows in the uzumaki's line of sight to catch his attention. Summoning him to where ever the cloth placed, serving as a marker.</font></font></font>

Continuing to move back towards the bridge. They would scan their environment looking for a way to defend themselves from the encroaching assault.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) One by one, her hands swung with those galavanting strides. Each audible step just gave a warning and reminder of the damage she was capable of inflicting. To step back was to delay the inevitable.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one making this harder on yourself&#34;</font> She calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would turn around, staring at the afro haird child as he seemingly ripped off a piece of cloth with his clan&#39;s crest on it.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need a piece of cloth to summon you. If I find myself in need, I will take The Commander above a Student. Like I have said before...I am watching you all.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) That feral push was nothing short of &#39;overdoing it&#39;. There wasn&#39;t an ounce of restraint in it, clear by the lack of worry or response from the blonde as their face bounced on the pavement. She stood above him, her hands still twitching with the anticipation of more. Clearly, their last exchange of blows didn&#39;t teach the cold one anything.

Fortunately, despite this rage, she wasn&#39;t some sort of psychopath.

Those jittering palms made their way to the cold youth&#39;s shoes. That cry and the surrounding blood were, yet again, idly ignored as she took to reaching down towards those shoes. Clutch as much as they&#39;d like, she pulled and pried those two straight from his feet.

With them in tow, she took to holding them both with a singular hand; her index and middle finger capable of hoisting them up. She immediately about faces, her attention already upon the instructor of said punishment.

     <font color = white>&#34;Operation complete, Commander!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sweeeeet. nice one, Hana.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) sighed. She eased forward slowly, and suddenly rushed to the area of the attack - she noted the injuries, and the outcome but that wasn&#39;t what truly caused her concern. 

She noted blood, blood touching her pavement - ruining her street and it caused her to briefly chuckle. 

   <font color = white>&#34;As stated before, anything done to the village will be applied to you - and I see blood on the street,&#34;</font>

Even in the view of a higher-up, she didn&#39;t truly care and suddenly she moved to curve her hand around and lurch a singular fist towards the stomach of the Student. It wasn&#39;t designed to inflict injuries, just a subtle method to ensure they remember. 

   <font color = white>&#34;That will be all,&#34;</font>

She had obtained her mission objective; the small one had been punished for their injuries. All was <i>mostly</i> right with her world.

    <font color = white>&#34;See that, Beisame? That&#39;s how you--&#34;</font>

Unfortunately, that lock onto familiar faces cost her. Before she could even finish her sentence or identify the attack, a devastating shot rocked the tanned one&#39;s midsection. She immediatly lurched forward, her grip upon the boy&#39;s sandals <i>nearly</i> releasing from that shot of pain.

All of the energy within her body was forcefully knocked out of her. She nigh crumbled just from that singular strike alone-- forced to shaky knees. If the dancer wasn&#39;t holding back, it was certain that the blonde would have been reduced to the same unconcious state that she left the cold youth.

     <font color = white>&#34;W-Wait.. I-I&#39;m..&#34;</font> She tried to speak.. but that fresh damage made it impossible to formulate a sentence. Pained, weakened eyes mixed with her expression to convey a message;

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had already shifted, and turned in place - agile grace, and practiced movements could be noted while her hands instantly moved behind her back and furled into a locked grasp. 

She seemed as if nothing had occured. 

   <font color = white>&#34;When you can stand again, please do ensure that blood is cleaned up - and try not to let the Yuki die,&#34;</font>

The soft thuds of bare-feet with trimmed cloth could be noted while she eased back to her original location. She had finished what she needed to finish.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) throughout the use of the convienient diversion made by the higher up, Nahoko approached the profound blonde and looked down at her.
   Slowly, yet surely the girl bent over and grasped at the blonde's sandals. Without making much sound she attempted to yank the smelly things free of her feet before taking off like a bullet in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>

In such, the boy closed the distance from his previous position to the girl with blonde-hairs side.

The blue-scaled hand of the Hoshigaki grasping their wrist with somewhat decent strength. No where near his friends - but enough. With a face as dead-pan as the Uzumaki behind him, he began speaking.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) To say she was unconcious was an overstatement. She might not have been standing upright but she <i>was</i> sentient of her surroundings. As that hand reached towards her mission objective, her hand instinctively came down towards her torso where she clutched the two sandals.

     <font color = white>&#34;H-Hands.. off..&#34;</font> she called out as she slowly managed to rise to a standing position. Still dazed, she took note of <i>yet another</i> elder who brandished their prowess and power. Unfortunately, the blonde wasn&#39;t in any state to argue. She gave only a slow nod of understanding whilst her free hand nursed the freshly inflicted blow to her core.

     <font color = white>&#34;S-Shouldn&#39;t.. the so-called &#39;medic&#39; be helping this guy out..?&#34;</font> she inquired, her half-wrapped foot gesturing towards the Yuki covered in blood.</font></font></font>

He will grab two small bandaids,then place a fabric to the wound and keep it with the two bandaids.After the treatment was done he will simply wait for the unconcious person to awake,afterall he did what he can with his basic knowledge of the human body</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You are Tsukiko.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sits rubbing the wound on their head observing the commotion unfurling before him. This child who had healed him had quite the gumption to be backtalking the commander the way he was.

However, he could not help but hope nothing bad befell him. He had healed him when others chose to make a victim of him. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) coughed. Her intuition betrayed her.

     <font color = white>&#34;R-Right. Sorry about that, Commander. That punch, you know? Think it knocked around more than just my lunch.&#34;</font> She followed with a dry chuckle-- a rather poor attempt at playing off the situation.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Tell that boy your name.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) shook out of her daze and approached the Commander at his behest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) pulls out a single hand, gesturing towards Tsukiko and her shark-kin companion. <font color = white>&#34;If you can not follow simple orders then you are of no use. What if who you think to be your comrade is actually a mole? A mole only I know of. You would ruin an entire mission and operation. Can you handle that much? From the looks, I can&#39;t tell.&#34;</font>

He peers over to Nahoko.

<font color = white>&#34;Nahoko has good comprehensing skill.&#34;</font> He gestures toward her now. <font color = white>&#34;If I told you to attack Tsukiko right now. What is expected of you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) looked to her left, her gaze surverying those present.
    <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d figure out who Tsukiko is and attack them. Hesitation to follow an order can be the difference between a won and lost battle.&#34;</font> 

   The girl recalled her previous conversation with the Commander where he&#39;d drilled home the same point.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and places their aching head in their hands. They did not like this lesson very much. This Uzumaki Commander was just as vicious as his elders had warned.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yeah, its a world of older people beating on younger people because they know they can.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: One day, the roles will reverse.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is entirely untrue.

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) weakly gets to his feet, his legs wobbling beneath him. His equilabrium was still shaky following the vicious blow to his head. His eyes would lock onto the hag who had assaulted him for a second time, as he approached the commander. 

The small child would radiate an aura of hatred towards the fellow villager. In his mind plans and ruminations of vengeance against her already had begun to take hold.

He would carefully approach the red haired commander, staring up at him with their small stature.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes....Sir..&#34;</font>, he said, begrudgingly knowing that this man&#39;s order was the reason that he had been so viciously assaulted and beaten.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You were targeted and beaten.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: How do you feel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Well my head hurts and I want to pay that ha...girl back.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Potential?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your shoes are in their grasp forever. After graduation, you are to take them back.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How am I suppose to do that? She hits like a professional sumo wrestler.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm too small..

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Do not become complacent.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep trying.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Just get bigger.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'll pay her back one day, no longer how long it takes.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep burning in the furnace that is my command until you've become something worthy of being made a blade.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Am I understood?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yes...Sir...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Sumo..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Enough of this weak persona. Shed it thoroughly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pinched at her own waist. She wasn't fat...

...was she?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You may leave.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) bows respectfully not wanting to be party to another beating. There was something about this elder man that unsettled him. His senses screamed at him to not anger this man, although he had not done or said anything outwardly hostile. It was just a feeling that he could not shake.

Turning to leave, he would glare at the profound blonde. His cold icy anger boiling over as he observed his shoes in her grasp. He would look down at his cold pale feet which were covered in dirt, as he grasped his fists and trembled.

<font color = white>&#34;You will pay...&#34;</font> ,he thought, as he walked around the 2 savages and stood next to Rose.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) When the Yuki walks past her, Tsukiko only gives him an arched eyebrow. What <i>would</i> convey confusion invites something else. A dare, almost, for them to try their luck once more.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Aye, aye.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: That.. sounds like it'll be annoying.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yeaaah, very tedious.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....this is so stupid

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: You still don't get it, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think he ever will.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I get we shouldn't question what we do
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But i rather question why shall i kill someone from our village if im not given enough information
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Because it's an order.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think anyone said anything about doin' that.. but you'd just do it because you were told to. Its not that complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: See...thats my issue.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Precisely.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There needs to be a reason
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's what's bein' a Shinobi is about.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: There is a reason.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: They said so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Picture this; Red Commander tells Beisame to kiss you. I don't think he'd want to do it at all.. but an order is an order!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess you will realize it later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If he tries to kiss me i will kick them in the croutch
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Why is it always weird around here?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Kinda confused as to what really happened here
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Eh? I'm not kissing no man.
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers: Hey big sis, didn't see you in the crowds earlier. How are you?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) nodded her head gently, their arms crossed, idle, unblinking eyes hover upon the  sukeban, an unending glare the only response to their thumb. <font color = white>&#34;Ooooh. Truue. Seems kinda empty.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Mhm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) sneaks up on Mikazuki.. She&#39;s as stealthy as a snake approaching its target! As she nears her self-proclaimed best friend, she pounces like a lioness! 

The younger girl recieves a tight hug from behind. <font color = white>&#34;Sup! Bestie!&#34;</font> She shouted in surprise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (19 or higher u saw me coming!)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) <font color = white>&#34;We~ll, crowds aren&#39;t really the best for muggin&#39;..&#34;</font>
The girl mentions whilst giving the bow a pat on the head. Turning her attention back to the plaid eyed girl, she goes to speak- only to see them getting flanked with an embrace. 
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. pft.&#34;</font> Leaving them be, she turns her attention back to the kid. <font color = white>&#34;-anyway. I miss anythin&#39; major?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) continued to stare at the sukeban idly, blinking once after an unaturally long amount of time glaring them.

They&#39;d widen her plaid eyes when she suddenly felt arms wrapping about her, a shiver came quite immediately on the first moments of contact, and yells. <font color = white>&#34;AAAAAAH!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Boop!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Yah miss me huh, Mika?! I know you did.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) turn to his big sister&#39;s side as he replies, <font color = white>&#34;Aside from the bridge being destroyed and me having to rob a hoshigaki of his shoes under the Commander&#39;s order... not really&#34;</font>

Moving forward, the bot would adjust himself to take a seat along the steps leading up tot he village&#39;s monument. 

<font color = white>&#34;How have you been, I haven&#39;t seen you since enrollment it feels like.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Hmmm... I believe I'm being assaulted.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) yells: Eh!?!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) asks: Huh. Did he have nice shoes, at least?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: By who!? I'l get em! I got your back bestie.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) throws a few stray air jabs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: I didn't really pay any attention to them. It was just an order that I was following really.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Mm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ....Oooh.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: You.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) pays no mind to the &#39;assault&#39; happening to the north. As the boy shows interest, she steps between them and him to lift a finger.
   <font color = white>&#34;Oi! Remember- don&#39;t get involved unless ye&#39; know &#39;em, or you&#39;re gettin&#39; paid.&#34;</font>

With those words of wisdom(?) shared, the delinquent tucks her hands in her pockets and steps out from betweem him and them, to walk down the stairs.
   <font color = white>&#34;But-- I&#39;ve been good. Nothin&#39; changes... What about you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pipes up, the mention of the commander spurring the girl to action. She approaches the duo of off-white haired youth. Attached to her hip are a standard pair of sandals-- ones clearly too small for her to wear.

Her own feet bare nothing more than wraps. <i>Strange</i>

     <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that anymore. I took care of it.&#34;</font> she states to the reserved youth.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) spares a glance at the newcomer who approaches. She gives them a quick once-over before cracking a little grin. Turning to face them in earnest, she steps up and drops the tip of her finger down at the blonde&#39;s shoeless, dripless feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Hah! What&#39;sa matter, can&#39;t afford some <i>shoes?&#34;</font></i> She emphasizes the word by giving the sandles strapped at the blonde&#39;s hip a condescending flick.
   <font color = white>&#34;Ya&#39; may as well put those on, y&#39;know. Make yourself look a lil&#39; less homeless.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) asks: Ahh, good--.. erm. Landmines?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A mere slip of the tongue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: . . O-okay. Just makin' sure.

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Kunai, Shuriken and Senbon accordingly - if you use them and get blood on my pavements, streets, and so forth I believe I made my point earlier.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: I want a Katana.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Oh-.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: What was that?
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: I meanI have an itch.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) squints, her eyes taking note of the unfamiliar face. Her eyes needn&#39;t follow the finger-- the comment is something that the blonde had become accustomed to as of late.

     <font color = white>&#34;They&#39;re just a waste of money. Bunch of wraps&#39;ll get the job done.&#34;</font> She responds. Her own hands move towards the pair clipped to her person. She taps them once and then--

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Sides. These are bein&#39; held on Red Commanders orders.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) awaited her impending doom.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: enough gambling for today.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Yo Najiro, Spot me 20 ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why?

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I just need 20 ryo. I'll pay you back double later.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: I think the Tournament was canceled?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...i won't buy stuff from the local blacksmiths bill

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) twitched. 

   <font color = white>&#34;It hasn&#39;t finished, so many people seemed to vanish,&#34;</font>

She then shifted towards the young Student, her hand easing back to nestle the hilt of a massive blade adorned across her back. An Odachi of gigantic mass, and weight yet she eased back once she realized what was about to occur. 

She had no reason to inflict lasting harm, not now but perhaps later.

   <font color = white>&#34;I forgive you,&#34;</font>

A cold-stir of words, and she moved to extend her hand and SLAM it into her stomach much as she had done someone else earlier today. A brief adjustment in behavior if anything. 

She then moved to ease back towards her spot, and her hand pushed back behind her back to meet the other one.

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Just help a fellow shinobi out.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Considering today they didn't called us for work on that bridge.

The sentiment didn&#39;t sit right with her. Instead of suggesting she nab the shoes off of another, the Hozuki opts to disprove the notion right then and there. Just as she was about to go dig up some sharp gravel for the girl to walk across, her attention was stolen by a blurred movement nearby.

By the time she got her eyes centered on the dancer, their fist had already connected, leaving her to watch in awe as the student, presumably, buckled and fell from the weight behind the strike.
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. Damn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Higane.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) knew that the moment following the slip of her tongue were simply the calm before the storm.
    As the muscular, odachi wielding shinobi approached her Nahoko remained as silent and as still as possible. Perhaps somewhere in the back of her mind she thought that if she didn&#39;t move or make a sound she wouldn&#39;t be the nail that got hammered.

   Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case as the act of the elder shinobi&#39;s fist slamming into her stomache at a speed far exceeding her contention instantly caused her to double over in agony.
       A few dry heaves reverberated through the area as an intense, burning pain spread through the girl&#39;s body in relation to the action.

They said to the chuunin as their gaze roamed the different faces gathered around this point of the village. Many he knew, but there were also some strangers whose names escaped him, a reminder of the ever-expanding community they were a part of.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: See, Botan, I agree. I prefer using large weapons to club m'opponents, personally.

Such a hold caused a cry to escape from his body. Yelping across the yard in a state of pure panic.
      <b><i><font color = white>&#34;Owowowowow.. Okay-okay-okay, you win, letgo-letgo-letgo&#34;</font></b></i>, his panic jibber-jabble multiplying as the pinch held on.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Now, for you Bill. What are the three main tools of a Shinobi? The most basic ones.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, Umm...Kunai, Shuriken and Log.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Log?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Huh.&#34;</font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: log isn't a tool..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Only a little though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) quickly moved to do as she had done before, and produced a singular shiny-metallic item from within her sleeve. This time? It was a Shuriken, a singular Shuriken - it wasn&#39;t much but it was still free.

She handed it over.

   <font color = white>&#34;Continue,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) once more moved to produce an item from her sleeve, and this time it was the last of the fundamental three. A singular, freshly sharpened, and steel-carbon infused Kunai. 

It was basically a fancy knife, and she tossed it over towards the young man. 

   <font color = white>&#34;A Kunai,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

blinked.
blinked.

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned.
