<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s relentless stride towards Higane slows as her words cut through the air, piercing his focus like a well-aimed blade. Her snicker and taunt reach him clearly, igniting a flicker of irritation in his eyes that he struggles to conceal behind a mask of stoicism.

He hears her accusations about his demeanor, about not understanding what it means to be revered, to carry the weight of expectations. For a moment, Sogeki&#39;s gaze intensifies with a silent challenge, his jaw tensing imperceptibly.

<font color = white>&#34;You think I don&#39;t know pressure?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice is low, carrying a hint of raw intensity. <font color = white>&#34;Being at the top means everyone&#39;s watching, waiting for you to slip. It&#39;s a different kind of pressure, one that fuels me.&#34;</font>

His demeanor shifts subtly, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. <font color = white>&#34;But that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, isn&#39;t it? To show them all who stands at the pinnacle.&#34;</font> His tone is nonchalant yet laced with confidence, his eyes locking onto Higane&#39;s with a calculated glare.

Despite her faltering stance, Sogeki remains cautious, sensing an opportunity amidst her wavering resolve. His own pride and determination drive him forward, pushing him to capitalize on the moment and assert his dominance once more.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Whats with everyone trying to sound so...tough
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Main character syndrome.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s had said too much. To think that none of this would have happened if she didnt hear fellow nearby colleague speak of how mighty the Hyuuga believe themselves to be.

Like a fortress crumbling under the weight of a dragons paw, Higane drops her stance and backs off, raising a heavy hand high above her head. <font color = white>&#34;I surrender.&#34;</font> She laments.

The spiral of ying and yang emotions bubbling inside her could not be quelled, at least not now and not here. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;l change the stigma. Mark my words.&#34;</font>

These are the last things the young girl says as she backs off taking a seat on a nearby colum.. She flips her pouch around..

Now fully visible was the Cadeuces Staff and the Red Cross, labeled across her pouch. She remained there idle and fumbling through her supplies ignoring any attempts at discussion.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s intense gaze follows every movement of Higane&#39;s retreat, his expression a mix of frustration and disappointment. He had been ready for a clash of wills, eager to prove his dominance in combat, but now that opportunity slipped away with her surrender.

<font color = white>&#34;What? You&#39;re giving up just like that?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice carries a hint of irritation, his brow furrowing deeply. His hands clench into fists at his sides as he steps closer, his posture tense with pent-up energy.

<font color = white>&#34;You had me on the ropes, and now you&#39;re backing down?&#34;</font> His words are sharp, laced with a mixture of scolding and begrudging respect. <font color = white>&#34;You talk a big game, but you fold when things get tough. How do you expect to change any stigma like that?&#34;</font>

Despite his frustration, Sogeki&#39;s features contort into a slightly exaggerated scowl, emphasizing his displeasure at the anticlimactic end to their confrontation. His pride demanded a real challenge, not a forfeit, and he couldn&#39;t hide his disappointment at the missed opportunity for a true test of his abilities.

<font color = white>&#34;Next time, don&#39;t surrender so easily,&#34;</font> he mutters under his breath, turning away with a dismissive wave of his hand. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</font> With that, he stalks off, his demeanor a mix of simmering anger and determination to find a more satisfying challenge elsewhere.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I could use some ryo for weapons.

<font color = white>&#34;Yo, good see family on the rise, your Jyuuken is heat no lie.&#34;</font> he horribly rapped to his fellow clansmen.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hmph!How dare you disrespect me!&#34;</font>she said as she opened up her purse to only see her beauty products and a single ryo.A single sweat droplet would flow down her face as she remembered she gambled and spent all of her money on her new heels.

<font color = white>&#34;It was worth it too.&#34;</font>she thought to herself as she admired her shoes.


<font color = white>&#34;Psh!I&#39;ll just have to ask my old man when I see him again.&#34;</font>she would tuck her hair behind her ear as she knew the kage stopped funding her due to the over spending hence why she decided to become a shinobi.

If anyone was listening they would be able to hear her purse gasping for air due to the lack of money she has.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey now..its alright to not be rich.Im not from noble clan,so my survival consists on what i do.Whoever...&#34;</font>His face will go serious,like he was dead serious on what was about to say next

<font color = white>&#34;Try to make money by yourself,your father won&#39;t support you forever,remember that.So you might have alot of ryo now...but if just spend and spend without thinking of how to invest and increase it...sooner or later you might become a regular person just like all of us miss.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You never struggled...thats our difference.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: You're right hence why I said we're not the same.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You need to struggle...otherwise you would never learn.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: I am.
<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: Struggling isn't needed, you know.. She should feel lucky.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: You kind of struggled in our spar Najiro..maybe you can show her how to properly struggle.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would tightly grasp the boy&#39;s shirt

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve been cut off!The old man cut me off!Now who&#39;s going to buy me my stuff!I have to work!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Heh....and thats bad?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirks. <font color = white>&#34;You going to give up again Najiro?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look her directly at their eyes

<font color = white>&#34;You think thats bad? Having no monetary support by your father so you can get anything and everything? Tsk,tsk..Perhaps for you is bad,afterall you are spoiled since birth.

But let me say it again,what you experience at this moment...is what everyone NORMAL experience.You want your stuff? earn it.Do you think your old man got the money out of nowhere? That they didn&#39;t struggled? Or your ancestor didn&#39;t struggle? Cause let me tell you something..Without your father,and your ancestors trying their best...you would had been just like us,another small family member of a family which isn&#39;t noble,Neither anyone cares to know their name all around their town.&#34;</font>They will pause afterwhich will continue

<font color = white>&#34;So prove yourself as senju and earn what you belive is your right to have.The other option it to beg your old man untill he dies.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (call me victor blame cause im spitting the truth)

The senju would take a step back before dusting herself off with her lint brush.It appeared her silk dress had caught some lint from being to close to the black haired boy.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But the best thing? is maybe to finish the academy year...and then find out what to do next.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) slowly walked over some of the broken bridge&#39;s jagged edges, pushing herself over a few larger chunks until she made her way next to the plaid eyed girl. 

She didn&#39;t really speak her way, or try to make eye contact in any way, she just rested against a larger chunk of the collapsed bridge. <font color = white>&#34;Thats not what I mean, exactly-- Forget it..&#34;</font>

She paused to ponder, bringing a hand up to her chin. <font color = white>&#34;Mhm.. it&#39;s going to be a long year, now that we&#39;ve seen first hand whats to come.&#34;</font> She&#39;d add, slowly releasing a long winded sigh.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: Anyways
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: The dead are dead.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: Can't fix that.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Yup..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well Higane...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Everyone know their basic ninjutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess this year is gonna be pain..
<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: Nope.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) blinked, she side looked at the one who approached her, an eyebrow arched softly, before she&#39;d turn her eyes towards the martial artist again. <font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;d you ask if anyone was a Hyuuga here?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: For now though,im going back to my place.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) reaches into his open robes and pulls out what seems to be an endless amount of scrolls, handing them out to everyone who seemed in need of basics.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Be safe guys..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa8c5a>Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) reaches a hand to snatch the scroll from the air.
<font color = white>&#34;Whoa. Thanks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...That's a lot of academy basic scrolls.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Mhm.. Master Matsu keeps a bunch of em.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to have black markings in his chest where he pulled out the scrolls.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) says: Hmm...

<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: These are more complicated to read than I thought..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: Aren't they?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) blinks a few times.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) looks at him immediately. The protruding veins on his eyes making him seem a lot more menacingly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: ..My bad! I mispronounced 'easy to read'. Haha.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: ...

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...I'm ten-
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh? So I'm olde--
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) chuckles a bit while looking down towards the plaid eyed girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Ahem, yes Master Matsu.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to instantly snap into his happy-go-lucky attitude, making the disparity of his two personalities give an uncomfortable feeling.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: You will all get strong!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I believe in you!
<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: Thanks.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ....Huh.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Hm..
<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: Time to practice.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) pokes the plaid eyed girl, before softly speaking her way. <font color = white>&#34;So can I get a name yet?&#34;</font> She&#39;d ask.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki(The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) OOCs: (oop

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) was gently nudged, the slightest of touches enough to make her bend rightwards, and bobble backwards. <font color = white>&#34;...Mikazuki.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh... woah... Thats such a nice name..Crescent moon..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Where you named that on purpose? Like was the moon crescent the night you were born!!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I need answers! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: ...I'dunno?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: It's ma' name.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) swells up like a tomatoe as her cheeks puff up. <font color = white>&#34;Kay! You&#39;re officially my best friend. I declare it!&#34;</font> She shouted.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) widened her eyes, her jaw dropped. <font color = white>&#34;...Whaaaat?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Yup!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) yells: I don't even know your name!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) asks: Eh!?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (fuck you ezekiel!)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) turns around and lowers her head a bit, making direct eye contact with the girl. A set of pearly eyes staring directly at her.. or even through her?

<font color = white>&#34;Hi-ga-ne! Higane, of the Hyuuga!&#34;</font> She&#39;d speak her way, with a bit of a blush to her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (apples are goated
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) Ooooh..."

Mikazuki still had her mouth still slightly gaped, all the while she positively nodded as if agreeing to them, in whatever. They blinked a few times, keeping static, analyptical eyes upon them and their features for a few seconds, ceasing to blink, for a long time, just a piercing, replying stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki(The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) OOCs: (fUCK)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Yup! Besties, I can see it now..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Yup.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Yp.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Yup. Yup. Yup.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Alright! I gotta replenish my supplies, used up most of my bandages and ointment helping out here. I'l be deeper inside the village.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: To the hospital!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) dissapears deeper into the village.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Oooooh...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: 'Kay.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm? Hey.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he rounds the bridge. A short wave given to the blue haired boy. <font color = white>&#34;Heya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) coughs once, mainly testing colors (ooc)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) looks up from the ground. He had been in deep thought <font color = white>&#34;Oh. Hi.&#34;</font> He said, dismissively. He was beginning to wonder how many new people he would have to interact with today.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would offer a short nod towards the bridge, <font color = white>&#34;Do you know where the majority of people have gathered?&#34;</font> The softer boy was a bit of a social butterfly it seemed. That or he wanted a crowd to dissapear into.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) sighed, waving his hand in no specific direction. <font color = white>&#34;They&#39;ve all dispersed for the most part.&#34;</font> He looked at what remained of the bridge, then looked around the boy. <font color = white>&#34;Where are you coming from, anyway? Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s dangerous to leave the village right now?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he looks around, and points back up north, <font color = white>&#34;I went to the bridge from over there. I thought there might be folks hanging out at the bridge today. So I wandered on down. Lookin&#39; a bit for my cousin or two.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) shrugged, clearly growing more uninterested in the conversation. <font color = white>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t know who your cousins are or where to find them for that matter.&#34;</font> He began to examine the boy more closely to discern if he looked like anyone he&#39;d met today.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (Is there anything I could discern from your appearance as to who you are related to?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) had pitch black hair, and very, very fair skin. It was hard to distinguish them from a girl come to think of it. Though they were dressed in a very traditional manner. The way they stood screamed &#39;don&#39;t mistake me for a girl.&#39; He would nod towards them, <font color = white>&#34;You sure?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: ( that should help
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) squinted and leaned forward slightly to make out the boy&#39;s features in the poor light. Then he groaned and rolled his eyes. <font color = white>&#34;Another Hyuuga?&#34;</font> He looked down at his feet and kicked a small rock, thinking to himself &#39;I just can&#39;t escape them today...&#39;</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) blinks at the other, walking forward with an almost quiet step. He would tilt his head to one side. His long black hair catching the wind. The sash he wore about his waist had the symbol of a snowflake stitched into the white. It was almost hard to see until the light caught the cross stitching. <font color = white>&#34;What? No, I am Aoi of the Yuki clan.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) looked back up at Aoi with a somewhat softer gaze. <font color = white>&#34;Oh. My mistake then.&#34;</font> He was willing to admit to his mistakes. This didn&#39;t change the fact that he had little patience left for people today.

<font color = white>&#34;Still, I haven&#39;t met anyone anyone else claiming to be affiliated with the Yuki clan.&#34;</font> He said boredly. Another glance told him this boy was younger than him by at least two years. <font color = white>&#34;You should really get somewhere safe. I doubt you&#39;d be able to hold your own if anyone had ill intentions.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: You do know the village was attacked, right?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink at that. Looking back across the bridge behind him. <font color = white>&#34;We were attacked? I had been sleeping in the past couple of days.&#34;</font> He tried his best to not look concerned, but the boy wasn&#39;t good at making his emotions all that cold. The look of concern was palpable. He bows his head swiftly and respectfully, <font color = white>&#34;Thankyou, I should get back in the village a bit further. What&#39;s your name If I might ask it?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirked slightly, <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, there&#39;s a scary robot scientist puppet hybrid going around taking little boys and turning them into abominations&#34;</font> He paused, before leaning forward slightly and in a lower tone saying <font color = white>&#34;Literally.&#34;</font>

He stood back up straight and said <font color = white>&#34;Sure would stink to get kidnapped and never see your family again!&#34;</font> He said half playfully, half seriously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (context: a scientist with odd limbs and eyes, containing the body of a young genin(?) came into the village on this bridge, blew it up and was defeated by a jounin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) to say he looked pale was a slight understatement. He was shook by the notion. He bought into the story pretty easily. It conjured images in his mind of a terrible puppiteer looming over a puppet version of himself. He would pull his hand to his mouth as he gasps out,

<font color = white>&#34;No...&#34;</font> 
He wounded in disbelief he looked over his shoulder and scooted back closer to the village for his own saftey. He wasn&#39;t able to hold a cool steely noble visage with such a horrible story!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (Stated they will keep taking boys and I believe said they are amond us currently
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (everyone loves a good horror story to kick off a wipe)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) chuckled softly. Though he was an egotistical prick at times, he had a soft spot for people younger than him. <font color = white>&#34;Just get somewhere safe with someone you trust and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) Looks back and around and looked like he was worried.

<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: That's a good way to look at it
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: "I doubt anything more will happen today. You should be okay."

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (I'm out of here for the night, good luck)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would move to stand aside. And just generally holds a look of concern. Deciding to stay largely to the side of things for the time being.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) reaches down to inspect the bridge, their eyes scan across, checking the damage dealt. She hummed softly. <font color = white>&#34;Oh well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would nod over to the girl, <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s terrible! I can hardly believe the story....&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Yep.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Lucky I wasn't here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would look off to the water on the side. A little bit of his nerve recovering. He looks back, <font color = white>&#34;It seems most have turned in for the night too...&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Yep.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Mh-hm.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Hello
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) nodded his head, he was often seen standing under the shade of the tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hey.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Who are you three?

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Eh who am I?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) had looked over at the other two before returning his gaze back to the soft featured boy. 

<font color = white>&#34;Well it is very nice to meet you Aoi! My name is Tenjin.&#34;</font> he said.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) points a finger at the boy with yellow shoes.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he sees the other&#39;s shoes. Before looking away from the others.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) Daigen received the message about the urgent need to repair the southern bridge, destroyed in the recent attack. Understanding the importance of this task for the village, he immediately headed towards the damaged area, determined to contribute in any way he could.

Upon arriving at the bridge, Daigen saw many villagers already hard at work. The sight of everyone coming together filled him with a sense of purpose. He quickly found a section where his help was needed. Lifting heavy wooden beams and carrying them to the construction site, Daigen worked alongside others, his physical training paying off as he managed the strenuous tasks with relative ease.

As the day progressed, Daigen's hands became calloused, and his muscles ached from the constant lifting and hammering. Despite the physical toll, he continued without complaint, motivated by the knowledge that his efforts would help restore a critical part of the village's infrastructure. The camaraderie among the villagers, their shared determination, and the occasional encouraging words from one another fueled his resolve to see the task through to completion.

By the end of the day, significant progress had been made on the bridge. Daigen stood back for a moment, wiping the sweat from his brow, and surveyed the work done. The bridge was not yet fully repaired, but the combined efforts of the villagers had brought it much closer to being operational again. Feeling a deep sense of accomplishment and community, Daigen knew that his contribution had made a difference.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) smiled with an icy chill towards the stern boy, as he turned his head to the wheelbarrow. His small legs would scurry towards it, slowly approaching and examing the old shoddy wheelbarrow.

<font color = white>&#34;This doesn&#39;t look very sturdy...&#34;</font>, he said, as he grasped the large handles with his small hands. WIth a comical push, he would attempt to roll the concrete, pressing his entire body against the wheel barrow, as it slowly began to move inch by inch.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s....so...heavyyyyy.&#34;</font>, he said, as he struggled to slowly move the valuable concrete towards his shark-like comrade. <font color = white>&#34;Here I come, Sharky! I got some concrete!&#34;</font>, he said. After what felt like an eternity, he would reach the spot where the crack had been marked by the coral.

Panting and slumping down on the side of the wheelbarrow, he would yell out. 

<font color = white>&#34;Sharky! I got the concrete.&#34;</font>, his words broken by exasperated pants and gasps for breathe. <font color = white>&#34;Yuki are not meant for hard labor.&#34;</font>, he moaned.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I see....Hmmm you!&#34;</font>she said while pointing to one of the help<font color = white>&#34;Make sure you fix this light pole here I don&#39;t want to walk down this bridge and someone try to steal my purse.&#34;</font>the big construction worker would nod their head as they quickly ran to do what the senju demanded them to do.A single sweat dropplet can be seen flowing down her face.

<font color = white>&#34;Telling people what to do is sure is draining..&#34;</font>she said in way as she was flexing her wealth to get things done.A couple of hours would pass and Rose can be seen sitting on a chair while fanning herself,but suddenly the construction workers she paid for would stop what working  in unison and begin to walk away from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;HEY! Where are you going!&#34;</font>she yelled as one of the construction workers would hand the Senju a piece of paper which was a receipt <font color = white>&#34;-Sorry ma&#39;am but you only had us for couple of hours based off what you were able to afford.&#34;</font>said the construction worker.

This made the senju embarrassed because it&#39;s clear she spent the last of her ryo on this expensive kimono which was worth it for her.A sigh would escape the ju as she would pick up a hammer and begin to hammering  a single nail that she noticed wasn&#39;t hammered all the way in<font color = white>&#34;Hard to find good help these days.&#34;</font>she said while wiping her face off due the amount of energy it took to hammer that nail.

<font color = white>&#34;Hopefully the old man will give me more money.&#34;</font>she said walking off while also practing her sad puppy dog face in order to convince her old man to give her more money.</font></font></font>

He then flips the plans over, <font color = white>&#34;Ohh, okay. I see. I&#39;m Contractor Kreig.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Najiro will follow their intructions.As the mix was finished they told him to pour it carefully and without putting too much.As Najiro did what they said he either due to stress or just worrying put on each of them too much.This dissapointed the workers,but they called a kid afterall.

And just like that, he was back into the water, the container of concrete hefted above the surface as he continued to inspect the support strands. The damage was substanciaal, but most of it seemed to be above-water, causing for easy fixes with the application of the concrete mixed by his fellows.

However, one strand gave him pause. Resting the concrete on the strand, he dove under the water, and felt a chill down his spine. There was a fairly substancial crack, from the top of the support strand all the way down to the water&#39;s floor. It took a few moments, but he came back up and immediately yelled out to his fellows.

<font color = white>&#34;Aye, aye, I&#39;ve heard the rest of the clan was out and about, so it made no sense for me to stay put.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

The contractor yelled before he grabbed a <b>LARGE</b> piece of the rubble and effortlessly lifted it. He&#39;d shorlty thenafter hand it to the shark-like kid. 

<font color = white>&#34;Here go put this in the rubble pile.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

With the few little clacks of his sandles he arrived with a very large bundle. He was going to have to make several round trips. He was certainly that this bridge built in part with child labour would entirely hold up. Though he wouldlook over to the hard hats being given out. 
<font color = white>&#34;Do I need to wear one of these even if I am just delivering food to the folks working here?&#34;</font> He calls out having brought plenty of cooled drinks as well.

<font color = white>&#34;Darn wife wants me to go to the doctor, but we got a deadline to meet.&#34;</font> the man mumbled to himself as he made his way back over towards the edge.

Without much care he began to drop the pipe straight towards the Hoshigaki in the water. Hopefully he was good at catching round, awkward things with sharp edges.</font></font></font>

He did, however, manage to grab the pipe before it fully submerged. With that, he yelled up to his fellow Hoshigaki.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay! Okay. Great. Good. Yo Cous, wanna come give me a hand with this? We gotta keep the concrete dry with this pipe while we fill these cracks. We can probably leave the pipe in there once we&#39;re done and fill THAT with concrete too. You down?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded. She seemed to wander over towards Najiro with no true hurry in her movement - as she eased into place? She produced several bolts from behind her back, she was prepared. 

It didn&#39;t take much for her to simply drive them into place with but a flick of her hand, a bit of raw muscle, and they were slammed into home. She repeated such actions as required for each bolt. 

It took only a moment or two. 

   <font color = white>&#34;There we are,&#34;</font>

She returned to her place shortly after.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) was, simply put, waiting for the magic words to be spoken. Asking a half-shark kid to hop into water was akin to asking if a junkie wanted another fix. With a small grin, the boy vaulted over the guard-rail. His body submerging within the body of water beneath the bridge. Awaiting orders and ready to work, he stood - or swam, rather.

       <font color = white>&#34;For sure, beats staying up there, plus, swimming is so much more fun t&#39;me. Jus&#39; tell me what t&#39;do and I got it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: You can grab that for everyone, if you want.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and pouts at the words of the dark-skinned dancer. He would slowly walk towards the village, dragging his feet while lifting his kimono as to not sully it.  A visible scowl/pout on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;This is not fun at all...&#34;</font>, he mumbled as he headed deeper into the village, the sound of yelling and footsteps disappearing behind him. After a 10 minute walk, he would arrive on the steps of a large building with a large bright neon sign reading <font color = white>&#34;Ame Convenience&#34;</font>.

A sigh escapes his lips, as he enters and begins collecting packages of water. He would make multiple trips from the isles to the counter as he stacked 3 cases of water onto the counter.

A trickle of sweat would slide down his small brow, as he wiped it away with his sleeve. He would then head towards the back of the store and begin grabbing bags of ice. They were surprisingly less hefty than he had expected. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, do you happen to have something I can carry all this in? They wanted me to make multiple trips but I dont think that is going to work. It will take forever.&#34;</font>, he politely asked the shopkeep. He would explain his work at the bridge and how he had been assisting with rebuilding the destroyed bridge.

After a long discussion, they would be directed to the shops horse and buggy which he would loan the child only due to it being a mission to assist the village. After paying for the supplies, the small child would load all of his material into the horse and buggy, getting into the carriage and grabbing the reigns. 

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you, sir!&#34;</font>, he said, before quickly having the reigns snatched by the shopkeep who also entered the buggy. Apparently letting a 10 year old disappear with his only method of transporting his stock was too much to ask.

With a pout the two would slowly head back towards the bridge, the large stockpile of water and ice bouning in the carriage. As they approached all of the busy works scurrying around the bridge, they would wave. </font></font></font>

He creates a half-ram seal activating his Dojutsu to get a better view and get the spots the Black haired male could not see.

<font color = white>&#34;Byakugan....There are more over there Lady! Further down from where you bolted the others.&#34;</font> he said pointing down to where they were. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: YOU ALL GET THREE MINUTES TO HAVE A DRINK AND A SNACK BEFORE WE RESUME.

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The work in progress-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..A deadline?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) Would have left to assist the cold boy with his moving of the water and ice. All things considered they would haul it on along. Pushing it back and forth to the best of their ability. Though he would move from the other to Foreman Kreig. His hands lugging the two large jugs of iced tea on over to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Here you are sir.&#34;</font> His arms was shaking eeever so faintly. He was ill suited to physical work!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded; she eased back over once more - and this time towards the Hyuuga that had pointed out the locations. She took it upon herself to quickly jostle a series of bolts into place much like before - a few brief flicks of her wrist, and she slammed several of them home. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Very well,&#34;</font>

She chuckled, and eased back over towards her spot once more. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: YOU! GET A TROWEL AND START SMOOTHING OUT THE CONCRETE THEY JUST POURED ON THE SUPPORT BEAM.

Having only just arrived, the sudden gathering of blue-collared &#39;workers&#39; caught the girl by surprise. It didn&#39;t help that someone had already taken time to outright demand something of her.

     <font color = white>&#34;Is this some new way of asking for help..?&#34;</font>

She murmurs, her eyes trailing from the loud contractor to the crowd of youth.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) did as instructed by his older cousin, keeping a firm grip on the pipe. Whilst being utterly clueless in the eyes of stuff like this - Jinbeisame caught on quite quickly. The boy's grip tightening around the pipe as the concrete was soon to be poured. Or at least it was until the mention of a <b>THREE. MINUTE. BREAK</b>. Was this the life of the men behind the repairs of the village? A simple three-minute break? A silent prayer was made that he never failed as a Shinobi and would have to submit to <i>this</i> layer of work.</font></font></font>

I just need you to make it smooth before it dries.&#34;</font> he continued on towards the center of the bridge where concrete had just been poured into the support and more of the genin were starting to work on the railing.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) began to pour the concrete into the pipe held firm by his younger cousin, motioning him to tilt the pipe further and further as the pipe itself began to fill with concrete. This, was the best way to go about fixing such a crack - Otherwise, the concrete would become damaged by the water, and due to the sharp point of the pipe, it would be easy enough to lodge it in the ground, creating a solid pillar of concrete within the crack itself to maintain structure. The surface level could be fixed traditionally, but underwater, the concrete would become waterlogged. Thankfully, two shark-men are better than one.

<font color = white>&#34;Eh, break? Three minutes...? We&#39;re not exactly doing anything strainworthy here just yet, we can just save our three minutes and take a six-minute break later. Keheheheh!&#34;</font>, he barked out, as he eventually filled the pipe with concrete. 
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, now just put it flush into the crack, lean it all the way vertical so the point is digging into the ground at the bottom, and we can fill the top part. This thing&#39;s just a solid concrete-steel pole at this point, it&#39;ll keep this strut held good.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Like this?&#34;</font>

A quick hand pushed down upon it; clearly far too hard. Rather than make the material smooth, she actually left a rather large indent within it.</font></font></font>

With this leverage Kreig effortlessly lifted the boy from the ground and held him over the ledge of the bridge.

With that the construction worker simultaneously released his grip on the boy&#39;s shirt and took a firm grasp of his pants. Giving him the most gnarly wedgie imaginable.

Yet again, the mirror&#39;s the man&#39;s words. Her hands move once more, a standard attempt at imitating what he had displayed for her. She presses softer into the ground this time with the tool. There doesn&#39;t come a hard bit of damage like before... but the area certainly isn&#39;t the smoothest to anyone with a good eye.

For an amateur, it was all one could really expect.

Wriggling and desperately attempting to free himself from the contractor&#39;s hold on his undies, he said <font color = white>&#34;Fine! Fine! Just let go!&#34;</font> and with a whimper, finished with, <font color = white>&#34;This is child abuse...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Now shadowing the actions of his relative. 
                 <font color = white>&#34;Like this, right? Or am I being to loose along the steel pipe..?&#34;</font>, he spoke, his words coming off as a new employee seeking affirmation.

The actions of what went on above his head caught little of his attention. Though the audible noise of a kids underwear <i>ripping</i> caught his attention for a short while. A cringed expression spreading across his face but you know..

The man then went over to examine the shark&#39;s work. <font color = white>&#34;Lookin&#39; good shark boys. I&#39;ll have you two come up and here and get ready to pour the new surface for the bridge as soon as wedgie boy here finishes the forms.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
