<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Mysterious Stranger (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) rests with his hands and arms very nearly exposed, as shinobi begin to appear to the gate his eyes don’t narrow. His gaze does avert to them however.

His hands clearly rest upon two swords - one of which be a samurai sword and another which lie on a regular katana. A voice that sounds mechanical yet fluid seems to speak out, sounding more high pitched than expected. And like it had gears turning behind to make the voice.

<font color = white>&#34;This is...home now...&#34;</font> He whispers under his breath, looking amongst the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Hear ye, Iwagakure!</b></i>I’m an envoy of the Dakuteika - sent with a warning.&#34;</font>

He stops to see who amongst them would be the lead for the message. But since the other one that got sent to Amegakure never returned, he was heavily armed.A step backwards with a motion forward, for whoever would see themselves the leader amongst them to step forward and take a look behind him at the ten bloodlied headbands.

<font color = white>&#34;These belonged to some of your own, younger...<i>ones</i>, I believe. Much like those among your crowd. This is what happens to you out in the wilderness. You leave your village, and you enter <b><i>our</b></i> territory&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Sakujak, Ryohei (The short-tempered youth-Kwaj874) kept his gaze trained upon the man situated at their front door, his arms folded over his chest. With his eyesight, he&#39;s able to pick up on the man&#39;s items from afar.

Two swords, and a bunch of bloodied headbands of the fallen. It causes his expression to sour. The message was heard loud and clear-- an obvious threat.

<font color = white>&#34;Those headbands...&#34;</font> he says, kicking off of the wall to land down below. He commits the man&#39;s face to memory, not crazy enough to pick a fight without tools of his own.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana listened intently as the mechanical voice filled the air, her heart pounding with fear and determination. She observed the envoy steadily, taking in every word and detail. Her eyes briefly flickered to the bloodied headbands, a surge of sorrow, but she remained silent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) wasn&#39;t quite sure what was going on so for the most part she intended to remain quiet and observant, seeing as a Chuunin was called, this certainly wasn&#39;t her place to step forward or engage in any fashion. Being as short as she was, it was a bit tough to see through the crowd so she stepped forward somewhat to get a better look of things.

It was declared that some of the headbands belonged to their own. She cut a sharp gaze toward the &#39;messenger&#39;. Though unknown to her, she was visibly irritated that people from her home had been cut down. Someday her and her friends would be out there.

<font color = white>&#34;Tch...&#34;</font> still she remained quiet.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) arrives later than intended due to some difficulties. He stares at the man who arrived, at the bloodied headbands, and at the reactions of all those around him.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) lip curled, she was in no place to speak on such matters but she could not help but say something loud enough for her peers to hear. 

<font color = white>&#34;There is only one of them.&#34;</font> She pointed out and looked at the back of the older Shinobi. Would such an offense be let to pass? They had the bodies....but she was one of those bodies herself....</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) looked at sensei as soon as the headbands.<font color = white>&#34;So we are next? I hope not. But you got it.&#34;</font>The teenager seemed too calm and not stressing over the situation. He had full hope in his sensei to beat this guy to death. Taking out his book he would sit down and turn a page. He then noticed Shuye arrived and waved.<font color = white>&#34;Oh hey Shuye you came to the party or warning of this guy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Calmness remained with him throughout the stiff warning.

A Swordsman Messenger declared those he represented an enemy of their entire village. The foremost thought on his mind, reflected from a statement like that, could only be...

<font color = white>&#34;Their days are numbered.&#34;</font>
A soft, muffled murmur, beyond earshot.

More importantly, he&#39;s eager to see whether their superiors might shoot this messenger, who arrived here bearing the highest of hostilities. It was only karma. Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka)  From a squatting position, the girl would begin slapping the ground with three hands to voice her disgust for this kind of attitude!  This was sounding much like a threat, as if he was bragging about killing their genin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ayyo!  How brave!  Killing genin younger than yerself, must feel nice, ye?  Then coming to our gates?  Bragging?  threatening?  Ay ay ay ay.   Message recieved.&#34;</font>

Yeah, this Tsuchigumo girl was pissed, she was ready for a fight!  BRING IT!  Though as for making decisions or actions?  That&#39;s left to Bathroom Sensei.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) couldn't really see the bloody headbands because; his eye sight was awful, and because there were a bunch of people in the way. So the weight of the man's threatening speech didn't really land with the generally dumb boy.

But he did at least still understand it was a threat. It sounded like people had been caught by... bandits? Probably bandits. Outside the walls or something similar. A mostly uneeded warning for Hideo as he had no desire to go beyond the walls to begin with.

The guy had a bunch of swords, for example. What did he have? A cool rock he found on the way here and some loose change. It would take a long while before he was confident and geared enough to much further than he was right now. But he would go that far eventually.

Someone had to avenge who ever the messenger had, probably, killed.</font></font></font>

As if he were filled with churning devices, and maybe even a static charge that slightly irradiated from him somehow.

To those with ever keen sight, his body had very clear grooves but not like the carving of wood into puppetry - it was more refined and held smoother parts.

He glances towards the ground for but a moment, as if stepping carefully for some odd reason. With those having their eagle-like sight though? The area was littered with hundreds upon hundreds of explosive tags - all the way to the gate

Shuye's talents were lacking in this department. She was not particularly observant; she didn't have the uncanny ability to sense the energy in things her brother had, either. Worse, she was barely a genin, physically. No, explosive ordnance disposal was far beyond her capabilities.

She wouldn't have spotted them without another shinobi calling it out.

A traitor to the village, daring to come to the front gates...?

Was Iwagakure so weak?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) approached the scene, her eyes scanning over the crowd carefully before noticing someone outside of the gate-- Of course there was.

A sigh escaped her as she leapt overtop of the students, landing next to Chocho. Turning to face her for a moment, a smile is flashed, followed by a peace sign. She then finally turns her attention onto the stranger at their gates.
 <font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, she called out, looking him over from head to toe.

The camera in his eye was instantly spotted, alerting her to put her guard up. Perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps someone was actually coming to spy on them. Either way, it was work she didn&#39;t plan on having to deal with.
 <font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re just dropping stuff off, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font>, she began, her eyes looming over to the field behind him, noting the vast amount of explosive tags that were placed.

 <font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;know.. Someone has to clean those up, and it isn&#39;t gonna be me!&#34;</font>, she protested, venting another sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever..

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: If it means more ryo that means.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Please step back for the time being.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: If someone tries and one of them tags detonates...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Yes please)
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Would it not trigger a cascade...  A chain reaction of explosions?  Possibly taking out the cliff, gate and part of the wall or nore?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (more*

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would....not stop them as they left of course

this was quite a problem...there was a unknown person from a place called Dakeikae trying to dictate what she can or cant do....what they all can or cant do... But...this wasent a mission and it didnt look like they reallly attacked or anything.

However....if one of those explosive tags detonated....o-ow... SHe just let her peer handel the talking...after all..she was off duty at the moment!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (wym)
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: It ain't science.  It's fact that if a tag explodes close enough to another, it'll trigger it.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It would, yes.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mysterious Stranger(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: Need this ten fr now)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mysterious Stranger(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (I didn’t work on a lot of the stats as an intro, but they seem to go off without a seal and they explode at a high velocity range but will deal no more than mod damage - just really trying to get starters to save yall)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fuma, Katora(The blond lad-Iodized Salt) OOCs: [fair]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mysterious Stranger(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (If no opportunity exists for that, no more than mod and all that happens here is the steps and gate need repair - starters have ryo for that reward now ;D)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was susceptible to the explosions that had gone off unless he was saved by an awesome pair of shinobi. He covers his face, preparing for the worst.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) was probably safe, way up there on the village wall. 
Merely lifting a hand to shield his eyes from the brief blinding light that came with the detonation.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) The explosion erupted suddenly, sending debris and a powerful shockwave. Kohana was tossed to the side, hitting the ground hard and feeling the impact through her body.

As she lay there, trying to catch her breath, doubts began to creep into her mind. Was she really built for this shinobi life?

Unless saved by the Chunin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would of course!...try her best to...block all the explosions!...by explanding her body and body blocking the exterance of the gaze!

She was now...super big...one arm went to the one arm went to the right. It was more to stop the shockwave from reaching them...taking on all of the force!

HOwever...as the smoke settled..she noticed that the commanding man was gone...high into the wind...maybe feelings..unfounded..mm..un found....she then waved her hand to clear the smoke residue...as she watched their now broken stair case...probably covered in crystals...

[Aimed to protect those closest and behind her with multisize body block!]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) vents a <i>massive</i> sigh as the explosive tags begin to detonate outwards in. Perhaps it was time for her to actually take this situation seriously.

 <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s like.. The uncoolest thing you could&#39;ve done, random dude.&#34;</font>, she protested. Her hands came together, weaving through a flurry of seals.

With a clap of her hands, the Shingen musters all of her Chakra into the air above the tags. <font color = white>&#34;Doton: Otoshibuta!&#34;</font>

From out of thin air, a massive lid forms, hovering over the field in front of the group. The surrounding area was of no concern to her, the wall was far too sturdy for any amount of explosive tags to take it down.. To an extent.

The shadow that loomed over all present only lingered for a moment before beginning to shrink at a rapid rate. Anyone who&#39;d not yet realized a giant lid spawned in the air would quickly notice as it began crashing down towards the ground, sealing in the impending explosion.
 <font color = white>&#34;Man.. One of these days I&#39;m gonna need to get paid more... This is getting ridiculous..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mysterious Stranger(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: Cya soon Iwa)
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Wow you guys are pretty cool..
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: That guy did NOT pass the vibe check..
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Ninjutsu..Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I did not know there was a vibe check...But thanks.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I'm still deciding on you lot, but that guy definitely didn't pass.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: What is a vibe?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: It's something I have.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: phew
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Did you see his body though...  THat was...  Strange.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Yea. He sounded mechnical...Then like a child. All in one breath.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. His movements seemed a bit... mechanical.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nods in response. <font color = white>&#34;Looked like he was built, or rebuilt maybe.&#34;</font>

She shrugs. <font color = white>&#34;Who cares. He didn&#39;t look all that strong.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches in awe as his superiors demonstrate some pretty awesome techniques. Picking his jaw up off the floor he shouts. Interjecting in the conversation about a supposedly weird body the messenger had.

<font color = white>&#34;That was awesome Koume! Kitsumi! Can you teach us how to do that?! I mean- Obviously not the body thing. But the giant lid thing?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wouldn't be surprised if he were rigged to explode as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) arrives at the gate a few deep breaths could be heard. <font color = white>&#34;Whats going on ??&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would place her hands on her hips not shinking for a moment to watch what was happening south of her from a birds eye view.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) felt alot of body heat behind him. He looks behind him and a massive fat man stood there.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Wonder how he spread all those explosive tags without being spotted...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: He didn't do something to the guards patrolling the wall and guarding the gate, did he?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) shrugs.
 <font color = white>&#34;Dunno, but I know it&#39;s not my fault!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Very well. A gate attack while im in the village these bastards sure are a gutsy lot.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Didn't feel like an attack.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: That would make him the winner, speak now or forever be a capture the ribbon loser.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: There has to be at least one or two more, probably. Unless they've quit.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: What's there to talk about? 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Threats gone, its not any of your concern as a student.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) Daigen picked up a stack of bricks, feeling their rough texture and the weight of each one in his hands. He made his way to the damaged steps, where a gaping hole needed to be repaired. Kneeling down, he placed the first brick carefully, ensuring it was aligned correctly. With practiced precision, he applied mortar and set the next brick beside it. Each motion was deliberate, the rhythm of the task becoming almost meditative as he continued to lay down brick after brick.

As the hours passed, Daigen's focus remained unwavering. He meticulously aligned each brick, securing them with mortar, and making sure the structure was sturdy. Sweat dripped down his brow, but he ignored it, driven by the need to restore the steps for his village. By the time he placed the twenty-second brick, he took a moment to survey his work. The steps looked almost as good as new, each brick fitting seamlessly into place. The satisfaction of contributing to the village's recovery filled him with pride, knowing that he played a part in rebuilding what was lost.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaido(The troubleaker-EllDante) OOCs: (22 bricks)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Only 119 left...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Sakujak, Ryohei (The short-tempered youth-Kwaj874) decided to get started upon the strength training turned manual labor.

<font color = white>&#34;Chop chop he says.. t&#39;ch.. I guess it&#39;ll be good arm training if nothing else,&#34;</font> he says, deciding that it was time to lay the bricks. He began to do so, taking each bring within his hand to get a feel for their weight. They weren&#39;t too heavy, but he still began placing them down carefully in a straight line. It didn&#39;t take too long before his arms began to feel sore, but he was definitely feeling the strain.

He continues, finding that they still had quite a long ways to go, something that causes him to suck his teeth. He glances over at the multi-armed girl.

<font color = white>&#34;Oi.. we could use a hand here. Or four...&#34;</font> he says.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante)  wiped the sweat from his brow, his small hands caked with dirt and mortar. The midday sun beat down on him as he carefully laid another brick into place, ensuring it was perfectly aligned with the others. His fingers, though young, moved with surprising precision as he spread the mortar and set the brick down, tapping it gently to secure it. He glanced around at the work site, seeing fellow villagers and shinobi all contributing to the repair efforts. The once-devastated wall of the village was slowly but surely being rebuilt, and Kaido felt a sense of pride swell in his chest. This was his home, and he was helping to restore it.

With thirty-one bricks laid, Kaido paused to take a sip of water from his canteen. His mind wandered as he looked at the progress they had made. The destruction had been extensive, but the determination of the villagers was even greater. Kaido remembered the stories his parents had told him about the resilience of their people, and now he was experiencing it firsthand. He watched as an older shinobi guided a group of younger children in carrying more bricks to the site, and felt a renewed sense of purpose. Taking a deep breath, Kaido picked up another brick, ready to continue his part in the restoration of Iwagakure.

(31 Bricks laid)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) glances at the various bricks and pouts a little, guh she really was going to have to do this.  Wasn&#39;t she?  Well either way, her six arms would begin bundling up the bricks as sh ebegins to carry them over and stack &#39;em up.   Were they supposed to use cement?  She didn&#39;t know where there was cement to get!  Thus she&#39;d just focus on beginning to stack them up.  While others might be doing one or two at a time, she was moving six bricks at a time.  MANY ARM CLAN!

<font color = white>&#34;LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&#34;</font>

Yeah, Tsuneko was one hell of a vibe in and of herself!  The girl continued to work hard on grabbing up various bricks as she moves to stack them up, the six arms working in sync.  Yes, she was very skilled with her many many arms!  Either way, she&#39;d do her job of laying brick.

<font color = white>&#34;Heh.  Atleast it&#39;s not water pipes.  So we can&#39;t go, &#39;Hey ma I&#39;m laying pipe!&#39;  hahahaha.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stopped complaining once everyone else joined in the repair effort. His father showing off his doton mastery was equal parts distracting and inspiring. While he himself couldn't do something like that yet; it did at least make him want to get this over with sooner.

If only to move one step closer to learning how to <i>do</i> that. At least the bricks on their own weren't particularly heavy or difficult to handle. It was just a lot of very tedious, mundane effort. And a lot of bending over. His back was going to be absolutely shot tomorrow...

A simple skip backwards was all it took to clear the grab. Only to stomp right back into reach, aiming to tear the guy&#39;s Ribbon under his sandal&#39;s tread. Again!

But. Haste makes waste. He&#39;s not liking the sound of the Akimichi&#39;s latest utterance. It almost sounds as if they have a plan. And, well, he&#39;s already scored one hit upon them, even if it was by accident...

Hm.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) snickered softly. <font color = white>&#34;Well I did think you could hold out for a little while longer, but I suppose I couldn&#39;t beat him on my own.&#34;</font> with this, the Uchiha took a breath before rushing forward to finally join the fray. Admittedly with her impressively slow speed it&#39;d take her a moment still before she would be able to get into the mix.

But given just how nimble Katora was, winning wasn&#39;t likely an option. She&#39;d take a moment to survey just how many ribbons Chonamu had. She&#39;d now be standing firmly face to face with each of them. But who would she target first?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (Totally forgot to keep round counter going on my markers lol)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) never underestimated an enemy. 
      Overestimation was key. Despite not showcasing such thus far, he suspected the Uchiha might be capable of clearing the distance to him in one stride, which would spell trouble if they saved such like a Trump Card. 

Therefore...
     As the latest heavy-weight hammer of a punch came for him? The Fuma Student dared to dash CLOSER! Yes, he darts into their guard, slanting out the way of that devastating STRAIGHT! It doesn&#39;t even clip him as he, quite literally, ran two steps up their torso. 

Chakra Adhesion of the Wall Walking technique made such tactics possible. He used them as a human springboard, pushing off his second step into a full moonsault, gone flying backwards. He landed on his feet and used the momentum to skip himself even farther. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve spent a good amount of time observing while we&#39;ve tired each other out... so I think I&#39;ve earned a breather.&#34;</font>

Honestly. That no-throwing weapon rule crippled him the most! But, he would not complain.
