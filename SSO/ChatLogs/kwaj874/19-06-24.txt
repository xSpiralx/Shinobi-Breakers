<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Hm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9b948d>Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) scuttled over to the edge of the overhang. They allowed their feet to dangle over the tiled rims,
  <font color = white>&#34;It seems thou is still thinking about the execution?&#34;</font>

An inquiry had been directed at the Iron Vessel.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looks up at the youth, without even weaving a seal the man would flicker up and stand next to him. 

<font color = white>&#34;Sorta, boyo...&#34;</font>,he admited taking a seat next to him.

<font color = white>&#34;I know it was a bit distrubing for you kids..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9b948d>Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) had still been staring at the Jonin&#39;s prior position when suddenly, a voice had given a response aside him.

The boy craned their head towards the right, in awe of the shinobi&#39;s quick movements.
  <font color = white>&#34;Disturbing it indeed was.&#34;</font>

They soon lower into a criss cross seated position, their multiple limbs folding inwards on themselves,
  <font color = white>&#34;Yet, thy seemed to be the most effected by it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) says: I was but a mere seedling during thee's past, so I can not fathom what could have happened.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Ah- I'm ashamed that you all had to see me like that. 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) says: It was a surprise.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: No matter how strong you are, loss is never easy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Its hard, as a jounin and a father to hear about the death toll everyday. But you have to keep moving fowards dispite that.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: So when i got the bastard in my own two hands, i couldnt control myself, i didnt set a good example for you kids to follow.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) says: It does not appear so. Many in the census shared your vision.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: You kids have to be better than me.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: I'm not a perfect shinobi, i am only a goal post 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Your goal post, surpass me learn from my faults.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9b948d>Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) tilted their head towards a shoulder,
  <font color = white>&#34;Does that truly matter? Everyone contri..controb..&#34;</font>

An audible click could be heard shortly afterwards,
  <font color = white>&#34;Contributes the same, whether we are weaker or stronger.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) shrugs.
<font color = white>&#34;It does its the way of the world, strength binds all to a chain that cannot be broken&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;The strong will stand at the forefront, the weak will be underfoot&#34;</font>
<font color = white>&#34;What if you dont surpass me, and im gone what will happen to the village,your friends if we are viewed as weak by our rivial villages&#34;</font>,he put a hand on the boys head and messed up his hair.

<font color = white>&#34;The new generation must suprass the old, a tale as old as time my boy..&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9b948d>Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) had their head shook to and fro as the seasoned veteran ruffled his crown.
  <font color = white>&#34;One could simply become as strong as thee. I do not think it is necessary to surpass.&#34;</font>

A gentle breeze blew across the mountainous region, carrying with it a sense of tranquility.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) laughed.
<font color = white>&#34;I guess that could work to boyo.&#34;</font>,he grinned.

<font color = white>&#34;Though its not going to be easy, im the strongest there is after all..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9b948d>Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) laid flat against the building&#39;s roof. An aloof gaze is cast at the blue sky lingering overhead,
  <font color = white>&#34;It does not have to be me. There are many others that may reach thy&#39;s level.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) asks: Who would that be then?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) says: One from the batch of students thee had attend the execution.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: I thought you would have someone in mind.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Mokuri (The ashen haired mutant-TrollerNoob) says: Nay, whether one observes them or not, it will still happen.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) asks: What?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Who are these people.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) didn't care, she risked a seat on the bench, even if it only gave her a few seconds of relief.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: ...tired.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I'm pretty sure they're taking orders.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) asks: Can we go somewhere to discuss this?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Like we were doing...

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Before you randomly said stop...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: Hello everyone.

She stomached the energy to continue moving, following behind Soichiro and Junji.</font></font></font>
