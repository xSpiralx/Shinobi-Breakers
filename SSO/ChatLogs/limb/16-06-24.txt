She also noticed the plathora of headbands that lined the walkways behind him. Something was seriously off about this individual. The way he spoke...his movements and his overall vibe. 

<font color = white>&#34;Uhm...yeah I am.&#34;</font> the girl lied, hoping that giving off the illusion of her being more competent than a simple academy student might thwart off the threat of an attack.

<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) arrives at the scene and immediately drops down to the water below. His eyes change shape, the veins in his eyes becoming more pronounced. Even as he remained out of sight, he kept the scene above him in examination.

This was the perfect chance to get information on the enemy and the strenght of the new students, he seemed prepared to dash through the bridge itself with his pure muscular body at any opportunity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) arrives to the area. He stayed behind and simply observed. It had to be serious to warrant backup.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) seemed to be <b><i>very different</b></i> upon close examination. Organs in the wrong places, a chakra system that would make no sense and bursted with activity. Reserves massive in size, with a strange aura that couldn’t be placed correctly with what knowledge lay in hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I repesent the Dakuteika, before me are some...items we <i>procured</i>. And also a warning.

Well....I hate to see the living become something....else&#34;</font>

He seemed to be unarmed, but begins moving forward to the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;I wonder how many of you can stay locked up in here, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) eyes the blonde girl with a smirk</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to be put off by the figure's strange innards and is immediate in his change of tactics. He sneaks around from underneath, trying to jump out from behind him to pincer the man.

He stops just before jumping out as other people react.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) lets her instincts take over and hops back a few meters, growning the distance between her and the alleged intruder once again.

What could she do? The higher ups were present, she had no weapons..

Instead she just focused her self on what she could do.. Scrutinizing the indivudal from top to bottom, her eagle eyes keenly locking onto any unsual properties or hidden gimicks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look and begin to read the indivitual&#39;s lips,he was not chakra sensitive so he cannot feel any disturbance,but it was clear this guy was not good news.

<font color = white>&#34;Young bodies...but for what.&#34;</font>He will ask,while somewhat trying to think why they needed their bodies,a bodies of some beginer genins</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) &#39;s face twisted in disgust as he examined the strange scientist&#39;s figure and heard his words. &#39;The fuck?&#39; he thought. As his eyes scanned the blonde girl, he got a very uneasy feeling. He decided to take a defensive stance, just in case.

<font color = white>&#34;What the hell?&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) moving to get in front of the rest he would use himself as a shield to deflect any attacks coming.

<font color = white>&#34;Get back everyone.&#34;</font>

Seeing His partner go on the offensive he would do the same. Watching to make sure the students did not do anything risky he would prepare to use a jutus on the enemy if he moved to attack the students.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: What the heck is this?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as he took in the scene before him. The strange scientist with his unsettling presence and the scattered headbands spoke of a dangerous situation. His mind raced, assessing the potential threat and calculating his next move. Despite the scientist's eerie demeanor and the implied threat, Sogeki's stance remained firm and his expression unreadable, masking any fear or concern beneath a veneer of cold resolve.

He knew that action would be required, but for now, Sogeki chose to observe, gathering crucial information and waiting for the right moment to strike. His hand subtly moved towards a concealed weapon, prepared for any sudden developments. In the face of uncertainty and danger, Sogeki's instincts honed in, ready to protect himself and his comrades from whatever this mysterious threat might bring.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) stared at the scientist blankly for several moments, the unnerving intensity in his eyes making her deeply uncomfortable. There was a disturbing aura about him, a level of psychosis that was palpable and chilling.



     As a nervous tick, she ran her fingers through her golden locks while her gaze never wavered  as she regarded the bizarre individual who had just issued a dire warning.



<font color = white>&#34;So, let me get this straight,&#34;</font> she began, her tone laced with sarcasm and a hint of defiance. <font color = white>&#34;If we venture into the wilderness, you&#39;re planning to abduct us and transform us into some sort of grotesque and depraved creature such as yourself? Is that what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</font>

She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper,  ashs he  mockingly stated. <font color = white>&#34;Because if that&#39;s your idea of a threat, you might want to reconsider your approach.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) begins to shift and rattle. What seemed to be skin and bone was flipping and turning, to reveal a number of mechanisms. His back and arms twist and fold, and his body launches to the side with a number of mechanical creaks.

His head twists around in a three-hundred and sixty degree spiral before it swivels to face the two true Jonin. The body pieces separate and folding, allowing him to immediately slip out of the grasp of the incoming tackle.

<font color = white>&#34;We seek information, but not at the cost of warning. I’ve not come to attack, today, I’m nothing more than an embassy for words today&#34;</font>

The water off to the side begins to ripple, only noticeable by those with attuned senses or abilities such as a Byakugan. While another presence couldn’t be seen though, it could be felt. A chakra system very vaguely seen, almost as if invisible but not.

<font color = white>&#34;Power doesn’t lie in your village, it lies with us. Keep this...&#34;</font> he glances to the two Jonin, <font color = white>&#34;in mind, kids.&#34;</font> He begins to pull off, backing up from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;I bring your missing headbands as a gesture. Now, assuming you want to keep them and your lives, I think I’ll be going...&#34;</font> his beady, glass eyes, looking back and forth between the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;And if not, then we could all just...<b><i>go</b></i>&#34;</font> he begins to launch manically as he cast his eyes down to the bridge.

A bridge lined up with hundreds of explosive tags. <font color = white>&#34;If you catch my drift&#34;</font> one of the eyes winks. <font color = white>&#34;But you won’t have time to battle me and save them&#34;</font> A hand begins to form into a symbol, priming the tags but not setting them off.with only a matter of seconds at hand, would the perpetrator find battle? Or would the kids find rescue?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Shion! Protect!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) looked left, then right. Blinked a few times and quickly realized she was in a situaiton way above her pay grade.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhhh...oh SHIT! RUN!&#34;</font> she exclaimed before cartoonishly scamping northwards towards the end of the bridge before she was turned into a living firework.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) quickly scanned the area and took note of his colleagues. He felt an ominous presence but couldn&#39;t quite make it out. As one of the scientist&#39;s hands began forming a symbol, his heart dropped. For a split second, he felt frozen before his adrenaline dumped. <font color = white>&#34;We need to GO!&#34;</font> he said, trying to stir the others to action.</font></font></font>

His instincts kick in sharply. With a quick assessment of the surroundings and the looming danger, he darts to the side, his movements swift and agile as he attempts to evade the potential blast radius.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</font> Sogeki mutters under his breath, adrenaline coursing through him. He doesn&#39;t engage with the scientist directly, realizing the immediate need to prioritize the safety of himself and the others. His mind races with thoughts of escape routes and strategies to mitigate the imminent threat without escalating the situation further.

As he moves swiftly away from the danger zone, Sogeki&#39;s gaze flickers back towards the scientist and the assembled Jonin. His expression is a mix of frustration and determination, knowing that the situation has escalated beyond a mere confrontation. With a resolve to regroup and strategize further, he gestures urgently for the others to follow suit, seeking cover and safety from the unfolding chaos.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) jumps forward, placing himself behind the grotesque form before him, threatening to hurt the new generation of shinobi. The Hyuuga was a proud man, believing himself to be the strongest- but he was not foolhardy enough to assume he could both protect and attack at the same time.

In times like this, Matsu knew he could rely on the blessed vessel of the tailed beast. He relinquished all thought of defence and went on an immediate offence. He landing with a heavy thud, poised to attack.

A fraction of a second passed.

A large circle seemed to appear below him and the soon-to-be corpse. Before that very same second ended, Matsu had began a flurry of blows.

<font color = white>&#34;Juukenho!&#34;</font> He shouted, as he delivered two blows. Immediately he delivered 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64 blows! <font color = white>&#34;Hakka Hyaku Bijuhanaho!&#34;</font>

Fire overtakes the bridge and begins to crack the foundation as the force brings it in from itself and erupts outwards.

The very ground everyone is standing on begins to cave and quake, leaving nothing but rough terrain not easily crossed to scamper away from. The attacker would rock the puppet’s pieces, only to find the deformed body of a young child inside - his fists now digging into a thin young sternum and lifeless corpse.

The body itself, blowing up once it had been breached. Leaving the attacking Hyuuga with moderate injuries from the resulting explosion.

Papers reign down from above after smoke clears - with a singular message <b><i>we are already here.</b></i> Each of the students just barely scraping by with nothing more than minor injuries as they’re protected from the resulting explosions by their commanders. 
After all that’s left - nothing but splinters and chunks of a young boy’s body remain. The hyuuga’s palms soaked in the child’s blood. A child of Amegakure - a Genin, no less.

The expert use of the water jutsu saved the students from most of the despair, with nothing but be try minor injuries as a result

The muscular man tries to shield his face but is blasted backwards. He has enough sense to force a roll and lands on one knee, bleeding from various cuts- and his own hands covered in someone else&#39;s blood.

He stands, realizing the attack was over. He spits the saliva and blood from his mouth, not seeming to care that he just battered a child&#39;s corpse.

<font color = white>&#34;Not much we could do there really.&#34;</font> She simply comented, dusting off her kimono.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: That was flipping terrifying!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I guess thats the point of training though.

It wasn&#39;t much but it held pupose, and she tossed it over towards the Hoshigaki.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) walked up to the scene of people surrounding a catfish and looked interested. He had been wandering around all day wondering what people were up to and found this.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah a huge catfish, neat. did you guys catch him together?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (oops
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm? The Uzumaki managed that one, but the others have caught their fill.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (Thats it, we give Najiro a Water Gun.
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: oh good skills to have when you are out in the field.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (set up a village wide battle, with a score system.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..but i already know that
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) caught the knife - Barely, almost fumbling it and dropping it to the ground before achieving a firm grip. Deciding to work on the biggest fish first, he approached Afro&#39;s large Catfish, before tilting the knife, lining it up with the fish&#39;s eye, and spiking the knife into the fish&#39;s brain, killing it instantly.
<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s better to make sure the fish is dead before you prepare it or it&#39;ll thrash, for big fish it&#39;s easier to either spike it through the eye or to slam it against a rock REALLY REALLY hard.&#34;</font>

From there, he began to prepare the fish, spilling the catfish&#39;s guts as the Jounin approached. He pointed a free hand to Afro, the red-headed individual, while his free hand began to disembowl the fish, tossing the scraps into the water behind him.
<font color = white>&#34;Gotta get the insides out, they&#39;re not good eating. If it&#39;s a lady fish, you might find some roe inside, which is REAL good eats though, so you gotta pay attention. This one doesn&#39;t have any.&#34;</font>

From there, he descaled the fish by scraping the fish&#39;s skin with the blade of the knife, peeling off the hard, inedible scales and leaving the skin below, and once more he tossed the scraps into the water.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, so, we can eat the head too, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of it, so someone else can have that part. Now we gotta light the fire, and make a little contraption to actually cook the fish. We can just prop it up over the fire, or make a little spit for it with some sticks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: So, like. Anyone want to help me build the fire?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) strolls slowly through the village, their elegant kimono swaying in the Amekagure breeze. They would slow their approach as they noticed the large gathering of people.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what&#39;s going on over there?&#34;</font>, they thought, looking around for a vantage point where they could see what everyone was circling. They would walk over to a tree near the commotion, their small frame dwarfed by the massive conniferous tree.

With a grunt, they would jump not very far into the air, grasping the tree and slowly beginning their climb up. It would take a few minutes before they found a branch that could hold their weight.

With a small childish squeal, they would grab the sturdy branch and sit upon it dangling their legs as they observed the crowd below.

<font color = white>&#34;WOW! That&#39;s a big fish.&#34;</font>, he said with a child like giggle.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) looked from left to right, and seeing that nobody was willing to help he let out a sigh.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, okay. I&#39;ll do it. Just... Bundle the sticks up like this, put the smaller ones on the bottom because they&#39;ll burn easier, anddd... To grill the fish, we&#39;ll grab these two sticks that kinda look like forks, and just...&#34;</font>

He jammed the two sticks into the ground, grabbing a third stick and impaling the fish from mouth through the back as if it were a spit, before propping it up over the campfire with the two Y-shaped sticks jutting from the ground.

<font color = white>&#34;Now we just need to light the fire, and then we can eat the fish. Usually someone just lights the fire for me, so uh... Help.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is several ways to light up the fire without ninjursu
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Get two dried stricks and then make one of them rub the middle of the other stick
