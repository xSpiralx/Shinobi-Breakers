<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) As the young boy came to the required spot he felt the gaze of someone from a distance. He turned to his left to match eyes with the stark-eyed youth and simply nodded before turning to face the mansion again.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) Nodding to each as they introduced themselves he pulled out three scrolls and handed them to each student. He then took a fourth one out and revealed the information inside it.

<font color = white>&#34;These are signup scrolls. Please fill these out and have your parents sign them then bring them back. If you do not have parents then sign the second line that states so.&#34;</font>

He points to each section

<font color = white>&#34;The first section is simple. Just your name, age, eye color basic descriptors. The second section goes over what you will be doing while at the academy. The third section is a waiver that states any harm recieved during training courses is not to be used against the academy. The fourth section states that this course is made to raise shinobi of the village and what that entails.&#34;</font>

He smiles once again and rolls the scroll up.

<font color = white>&#34;Feel free to fill these out in your spare time but know that school starts soon so don&#39;t take too long.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) says: Oh are there more students? I don't know the two in the back. My name is Shion Shiroimu.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kensei (The stark-eyed youth-UltimateHelper) says: I heard you the first time.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yoru Hoshigaki(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Are we actually getting scrolls or just RP it)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) he smiles and hands a scroll to Tajin.

<font color = white>&#34;Here you go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nods his head as he grabs scroll from the instructor. He could read just enough but it&#39;s not like he truly understood what many of it meant, but he was told enough.

<font color = white>&#34;Great! Signing up!&#34;</font> He bit his forefinger before writing his information down on the scroll. Just the basics as asked.

Name: Yoru
Age: 12
Doing: Learning!

He held his hand out for Shion to grab it back.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) takes the scrolls and nods.
<font color = white>&#34;Thanks.&#34;</font> he said.
<font color = white>&#34;And how soon is soon?&#34;</font> he asked the jounin as he returned back to his teaching partner. <font color = white>&#34;Like in an hour?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) says: I can start teaching as soon as I have students but I believe the year starts sometime later today. I would say try to get the l scroll signed in the next 6 hours.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) went ahead and begin to fill out the paperwork, it was quite simple as the man had stated. 

-Yoshimitsu, 15.- 

Took him a bit to think over the doing part, was it asking him what he wanted to train in? He would stop and ask.

<font color = white>&#34;Umm, for this doing part is like what we aiming to learn?&#34;</font> He asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shiroimu, Shion(The warm man-Limb) OOCs: (also I am a chunin)
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: Heard.
<br><font color=green>*Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) says: That would be for fields of interest so we know what classes to place you in."
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) would give a nod before going back to fill it in.

-Taijutsu/Kenjutsu-

The male would finish up with how he looks and then sign his name. After which he would turn the paper in.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) takes the scroll from yoru and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;If you needed a pen I could have offered one. Should have kinda handed those out was not expecting a scroll this quickly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) taking the scroll from Yoshimitsu he smiles and nods.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you for filling that out.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) tosses the scroll back to the chuunin. If he had paid attention, he would have noticed Tajin did not bring out any writing utensils thus leaving the scroll blank.

<font color = white>&#34;Yokai, Tajin. Twelve years old and I plan doing whatever is needed most of in the village. My mom said she agrees with all the terms and the conditions of the school so no need to bring anything home. And yes, you have my consent for whatever happens at the school, sir.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) catches the scroll and and places it in his pouch. He did not really care if it was filled out or not he was just here for formalities sake. He could tell quickly that this group of students would be standard students.

<font color = white>&#34;Right.&#34;</font>

He looks to the new potential student.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello there are you a student looking to join the academy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kensei (The stark-eyed youth-UltimateHelper) looks between the two.</font></font></font>
