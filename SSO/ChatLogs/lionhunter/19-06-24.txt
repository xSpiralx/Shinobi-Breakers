Given that his father was no longer present... He could, allegedly, speak his mind. He still pauses for a moment. Taking an almost paranoid look around before simply backing up and over towards Old Man Tooki.

Once there, he takes a second to wave to Chobina and call out,

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah! Nice to meet you Chobina! I&#39;m Utsuwa Hideo!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;gumo gumo!....&#34;</font>

It suddenly began to expand ouwards behind her before she send it forwards in almost a blur towards the target grapsing hold of it!

<font color = white>&#34;pistol!&#34;</font>

SHe paused for a moment as she spoke there after as she laughed a bit nervously under her breathe.

<font color = white>&#34;this is the partial expansion technique you can learn at once you graduate. It uses our calories..per say mhm..so you will be feeling hungry afterwards. Il give a more technical explination when your actually learning the technique...as this is just a show case after all mhm!&#34;</font>

After a few moments her hand later crushed the target.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) eyes sparked with excitement. I like that name better! Gumo gumo Pistol!<font color = white>&#34; She giggled. She might incorporate those names into her attacks.

&#34;</font>Oh that looks very promising. So we will eat up our calories to use out techniques. Is that why your so small? You dont use to mant of them?&#34;</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mhm...i was small...b-but i recently had my growth spert!...n-no wait..maybe im still small by akimichi standards mm

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I mean your not even 18 yet right? Im sure you will grow tall~
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would begin to demonstrate the next technique.

<font color = white>&#34;p-pfft...i hope so...&#34;</font>

She paused as she began to demonstrate her next technique. Though felt defeated by the fact that she might not or might grow taller...mm..not that she minded....models were usually tall no?

A-ah focus koume focus!

<font color = white>&#34;il take a few steps back...watch closely...&#34;</font>

She would say as she moved backwards..and began to speak..a hand rose up to be placed infront of her mouth. It opened and the placed her thumb on it and began to blow.

<font color = white>&#34;gumo gumo!!!!&#34;</font>

She began to suddenly expand into a circular ball.

<font color = white>&#34;Balloon!&#34;</font>

She began to roll around in a circular motion aiming to lap her peers...and detroying the earth at their feet. However after a few moments she stopped....being envoloped in a cloud of smoke..and falling down from the air..once it cleared.

Upon landing on her feet..she continued her lecture. <font color = white>&#34;This is the human boulder technique...mostly using our calories as well...it allows us to expand our torso to become a ball so we can roll on our enemies. We can also use this while expanded..in which uses a higher level of calorie control...which is more for a chunins use case&#34;</font>

She paused before continueing once more. 

<font color = white>&#34;theres also the spiked meat ball version of this technique..however your control over your calorie drain must be immaculate or you just end up hurting yourself in the process. For the exact reason..il let you one when its time mhm&#34;</font></font></font></font>

suddenly the earth in the surrounding area began to shake...and suddenly...began to crack..as chakra began to be visably seen form her figure..taking the form of a golden yellow hue.

<i>CRACKLE crack!</i>

 However suddenly..it slowly began to go away..before she destoryed the place her clan trained in...Her chakra began to die down..becoming less visable and the markings that appeared began to fade away. 

<font color = white>&#34;if i didnt stop early..the ground would of been caved in...runeing our courtyard is a no go...on another note....this is called choharite....i dont think i need to explain what it does..no?&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh, you look like you're kinda related to Reilin, Suzaku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) brought her balled-up fists to her eyes, rubbing them gently as if the morning light was too much to bear. She blinked, trying to focus, and as her vision cleared, she found herself squinting at Chobina.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you too, Chobin.,&#34;</font> she said, her voice still held the softness of sleep. She lowered her body into a formal, polite bow, a gesture of respect that seemed almost out of place in the haze of early morning.

Rising slowly, she hesitated, her mind drifting to the conversation she had overheard earlier. Her face adopted a puzzled expression, and she bit her lip, nervousness flickering across her features. The corner of her lips twitched as she struggled with the question she felt compelled to ask.

Fingers twiddling, she finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, <font color = white>&#34;Is it true someone was beheaded?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) I nod my head. <font color = white>&#34;I wasnt there thankfully, but I heard about it. It was pretty day but thats what criminals get.&#34;</font>

The cubby girl was tired herself but she was head to bed rather than waking up. She had a bit of time to spare though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was trying to forget everything that had happened the day before, but the moment someone brought it up all the bad memories came flooding her at once, emotionally overwhelming her. The girl put her hand on her stomach while avoiding looking at anyone, her gaze fixated on the water in front of her.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, they executed a prisoner and made us watch, but that wasn&#39;t the worst part. It was right before that when things got ugly. It still makes me feel sick thinking about it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah... It was a bit more than just a beheading...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (myy daily...finally...ken spec...)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) yawned into her palm <font color = white>&#34;That is so. Such acts will keep us safe, as I was explaining to Hideo here.&#34;</font> she gave the boy a wink. As if they shared some secret. 

<font color = white>&#34;I have considered taking up the practice myself. If we behead anyone who faces us then noone will question Iwagakure when we step outside our walls.&#34;</font> she yawned again and looked up at the sky.

<font color = white>&#34;About time I rest however....good day children.&#34;</font> she say and give them all a bow before making her way to a bench to snooze.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (guh Ken spec before cores?! How brave)
