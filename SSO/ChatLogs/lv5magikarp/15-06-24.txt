<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) noticed the senju and offer a smile, or so he asusmed. <font color = white>&#34;Were you watching the fight?&#34;</font> he asked as the two turned to faced one another.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly turns their head towards the two boys situated on the opposite end of the bench. His soft features seemingly slightly shimmering against the bright sunlight. A small sigh escapes their lips, as they begin to speak.

<font color = white>&#34;Boring? Yes, I guess that is a good way to describe it. Nothing ever happens around here...&#34;</font>, they say with the tone of an irritant child.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nothing happens? What do you mean? A lot has been going on, and a festival is starting soon, as well...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) frowns slightly. <font color = white>&#34;I would enjoy the peace while it lasts, personally.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a small yawn as they sat near the monument his hazel eyes scanning the other faces nearby</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: All of that is...boring.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So what do you consider exciting?
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Anyways, Kusahara, got any plans?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: I dont know..Something...fun maybe?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turned to Subaru. <font color = white>&#34;Not really.&#34;</font> He said, leaning back on the bench, and turning to the new kid. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, like what? There are many things one can find fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) almost chuckled at that. Despite being thirteen, he already felt like it was a lifetime ago when he found childish things fun. <font color = white>&#34;I mean, I guess that&#39;s fun. We&#39;ll be needing to catch people when we go out on missions anyway, so in a way... it&#39;s training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out another yawn as they stood in the hospital</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) Daigen remained in his spot and observed the woman. Her interactions with the crowd were boisterous to say the least; her authority was telling and people responded with respect and attentiveness towards her. He noticed the way she spoke and took notes, understanding her building a strong rapport with each individual.
The boy picked up on a few key details, noticing how the woman often spoke about improvements and benefits for the village. It became cleaer that she was a local leader.
Satisfied with the information he had gathered, Daigen leaned back against a railing and took a deep breath while analyzing and channeling the information he had received. This would be crucial for him to build connections with influential figures in the future as he continued his endeavors as a shinobi of Amegakure. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) says: . . .
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (yeah I don't trust Ais its just how I write)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a yawn as he walked by a large gathering of villagers, and he would stop to see what was happening.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I haven't, personally, seen her before. At least, I'm not quite sure. To me though she may seem like an entertainer of sorts - However, she did fling a person into the water. This likely would mean she's either a higher-ranked Shinobi - Or kunoichi, or she's just very strong as well as, well, you get the point, probably...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s gaze sharpened with a flicker of anger that simmered beneath his confident exterior, fueling his desire to surpass not only others but himself as well. The dark-skinned dancer&#39;s blunt assessment of her training methods, harsh and unforgiving, resonated with him on a primal level.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm,&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted, his voice edged with the simmering anger that churned within him. He acknowledged the truth in her words, knowing that talent alone would not suffice in the brutal world of shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;Harsh, brutal, and often crippling,&#34;</font> he repeated, his tone now laced with a fierce determination rather than excitement. <font color = white>&#34;I understand.&#34;</font>

His eyes bore into hers with a steely resolve. <font color = white>&#34;I have talent, but I know I must work harder than anyone else to get ahead and stay ahead,&#34;</font> he declared firmly. The acknowledgment of his own potential was coupled with a relentless drive to prove himself worthy of her instruction, to push beyond his limits and emerge stronger, regardless of the challenges ahead.

<font color = white>&#34;I accept your terms,&#34;</font> Sogeki affirmed, his voice ringing with the conviction born of both anger and ambition. <font color = white>&#34;Train me. I&#39;ll show you what I&#39;m capable of.&#34;</font> His declaration hung in the air, a silent vow to himself and a challenge to the dancer who had dared him to prove himself worthy. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: And... Seeing as someone practically begs her to train them, she's likely Chuunin or higher?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ..what did that scrub just say..!? Begging? Tch.. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) continued to stand her ground; her hands never unfurling or leaving her back while she listened. She sighed briefly, and slowly motioned to ease a hand from the curling behind her back. 

She rubbed her chin slowly; her skin untouched - almost flawless in nature despite her information regarding her training regiment. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Earn it, over the next few weeks I&#39;ll be watching all of you - and I have plans to...educate you all in some manner or another. I have various little tests set up for all of you to curve the impending death many of you will walk into,&#34;</font>

She chuckled slowly. Her hand eased back, and curled back within the other once more. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t die or get killed, we can talk after that,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: My name is Torizuka, Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: A pleasure to make your acquaintance, of sorts, miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: My name is Hanamura.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: When give a full name, respond in kind.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I ... Am afraid I do not have a surname.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Nor a clan...
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A clan does not make one stronger then another.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would make his way over to a dark skinned kid</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That I agree with.
<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers: Yo. Whats going on with all the people here?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) Daigen nodded intently as the woman spoke about the village leader&#39;s strength and her emphasis on Taijutsu. His eyes flickered back to the incident by the water, confirming the impressive display of power. Taijutsu seemed like a practical choice for someone aspiring to be a strong shinobi.

Turning to Hanamura, he appreciated her insights and wanted to learn more about her specialization.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your specialty, Hanamura?&#34;</font> Daigen asked, curious about her skills and experiences.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Did I miss something?
<br><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) whispers: Oh? Nothing. That woman is just a leader of the village.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (...I could buy Blinding Seals, and be cheeky.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) turned her head to face Daigen a moment, before looking back towards Botan.
<font color = white>&#34;I doubt she is an actual leader, a high-ranked official perhaps. But I do not think she&#39;s a leader. No offense.&#34;</font>

She then lowers her head.
<font color = white>&#34;As for my specialty? I&#39;m a student. I have ... Ideas... And dreams and goals, but currently I need practice. Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, I suppose, if that&#39;s an &#39;OK&#39; answer?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) continued to stare forward as Sogeki&#39;s resolve seemed to flicker alight under the harsh layout of the higher-up&#39;s training methods. With each time the boy opened his mouth he seemed to break the otherwise hard exterior his present in hopes of being able to receive direct tutillage from the woman.

 <i><font color = white>&#34;?&#34;</font></i> - His expression was one that questioned why? Or at least, that&#39;s one would&#39;ve been right to assume from it.

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A Leader? No, I'm a Chuunin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) gaze shifted to the older dark-skinned woman with a raised brow, not having expected the village to be led by a woman.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers: Huh imagine that.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) nods.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand. Ninjutsu and Taijutsu are great aspirations.&#34;</font>

He turns to Botan.

<font color = white>&#34;You would not consider yourself a leader, Botan chan?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Its Ms.Botan.. she's kinda famous.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: No, the others may lead. I am simply here to ensure you all have the tools needed to survive.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: And to ensure the survival of Amegakure.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Ah tools. Do you happen to have shuriken on you?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Weapons of any sort.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: and it seems I must educate you on proper words.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I am always ready to learn on anything.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: *about*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) notice that even more children were present than before. As he stood besidfe the light post, he watch from a distance as the aggressive one engaged in a conversation below. His eyes wouldn&#39;t drift at the sound of a mature voice off to the side, however he did note that the word <font color = white>&#34;Chuunin&#34;</font> had been mentioned. 

Surely in time he&#39;d cross path wirth the chuunin one way or another. As for now his thoughts were occupied with the conversation occuring south of his present position. 

<font color = white>&#34;Sogek, everything alright over there?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: A grammer lesson so early in the day. Seems this Miss Botan ain't playing around.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: On that note for those that missed it, any damage done to the village will be inflicted upon you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) creeps behind the pillar of the nearby building ever so slightly, making sure half her body is obscured in its darkness.

<font color = white>&#34;Master Matsu mentioned her once as well, so-- Eh?? Why would we damage our own home?&#34;</font> She sneered from behind the pillar.

Her pale eyes peeking at each individual around, not missing even the slightest movements.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (hm, that perk didn't raise my str.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) was still drenched, that combined with her previous help-attempted being unnecessary, did dampen her mood a bit.
But she&#39;d smile again, even as the lady Botan seemed to be &#39;frightening&#39; in a sense.

<font color = white>&#34;It was an honor and pleasure meeting you, though, lady Botan. I apologise for not knowing too much about you, if anything at all, before seeing you here.&#34;</font>

The girl shook her head before making a few steps sotuhwards.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d better get changed into dry clothing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Southwards*)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) ears would perk up at the warning issued by the dark skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;Excuse me is that a new decree? I&#39;m not sure that I head any word of this from the morning broadcast&#34;</font> he asked while rotating his attention of to the side. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded. 

   <font color = white>&#34;People often don&#39;t take care of the things that take care of them,&#34;</font>

She replied to the pearl-lass, then she turned towards Hanamura and nodded before she began to speak once more. 

   <font color = white>&#34;No need for apologizes,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A personal rule really.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Well thats a shame, thats not how my family raises my siblings and I.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (hm, yah it didn't raise me str.

<font color = white>&#34;She tried to help you out of the water. Why are you still in there?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (I am not.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s frustration simmered as he found a quiet corner away from the bustling activity of the academy courtyard. With a determined exhale, he settled himself on the ground and closed his eyes, entering a deep meditative state. The chaotic noise of his surroundings faded into the background as he focused inward, channeling his anger and determination into a disciplined mental state.

His breathing slowed, becoming steady and controlled. The tension in his muscles gradually eased as he immersed himself in the tranquility of meditation. Images of his goals and aspirations flickered behind closed eyelids, driving him to push harder, to prove himself beyond any doubt.

As he meditated, the memory of the encounter with the dark-skinned dancer lingered in his mind. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll show you who the beggar is soon enough, NERD!&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s thoughts seethed with indignation and determination. His mind replayed the scene, the challenge laid before him, and the promise of harsh training that awaited if he could prove himself.

Each insult and dismissive remark echoed faintly in his thoughts, propelling him to show his true strength and worth. Amidst the stillness, Sogeki resolved to surpass expectations, to transform his frustration into a force that would propel him forward. The ground beneath him seemed to solidify as he embraced the peace of meditation, preparing himself mentally for the rigorous journey ahead.</font></font></font>

If so my I be bold enough to ask for your name?&#34;</font> he waited attentively for a response as he Sogeki paced around. </font></font></font>

Caught off guard, Sogeki&#39;s left eyebrow quirked in surprise, and he fell into a deafening silence. He scrutinized Daigen for a solid minute, weighing the request and considering the implications.

Finally, Sogeki shrugged nonchalantly and extended his arm towards Daigen. <font color = white>&#34;If we train together, that makes us one step closer to being brothers. You understand that, right?&#34;</font> His tone was serious yet tinged with a hint of camaraderie. <font color = white>&#34;Only thing left is a nice cup of sake to seal the deal.&#34;</font>

With that, Sogeki presented Daigen with a fist bump, a gesture of solidarity and acceptance of the partnership Daigen had proposed. It was a rare moment of openness from Sogeki, acknowledging the potential bond that could be forged through shared training and mutual respect.</font></font></font>

Crossing his arms as he stood beside his new friend, the child would wait for a response. Hopefully it was a location with seating.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Y-yes...&#34;</font> Sogeki stuttered slightly, recovering quickly. <font color = white>&#34;A tournament would be...

They looked to Botan, who was still nearby.
<font color = white>&#34;Maybe even ask a chuunin to oversee it as well....it could get the other students interested in participating.&#34;</font>
It was a simple suggestion, but to them, it would give the students more motivation to join them as they could show off what they knew to the higher-ups.</font></font></font>

Sogeki&#39;s gaze sharpened as he assessed the girl with the enchanted aura who had just addressed him. Her confident demeanor and the way she sized him up did little to faze him; if anything, it sparked his interest.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s demeanor was akin to a tightly wound spring, his temper simmering just beneath the surface as he listened to Rose&#39;s assessment. Her casual amusement at his presence and her focus on education sparked a familiar intensity within him, reminiscent of Bakugo&#39;s fiery determination.

<font color = white>&#34;Rose,&#34;</font> Sogeki acknowledged with a nod, his voice edged with a hint of challenge. He clasped her hand firmly, his grip assertive yet controlled. <font color = white>&#34;Education&#39;s important, sure. But so is proving yourself in the field,&#34;</font> he remarked, his tone carrying a confident edge.

He couldn&#39;t help but notice her lingering smile, and the thought that she considered him merely another challenge only fueled his competitive spirit. <font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll see how things unfold,&#34;</font> he thought to himself, a small smirk crossing his lips. Sogeki was determined to surpass her expectations, to demonstrate his strength and skill in ways that would demand respect.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s work together then,&#34;</font> he said aloud, his voice carrying a challenge disguised as cooperation. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll make sure you remember me.&#34;</font> With that, Sogeki released her hand and stood tall, ready to prove himself in whatever challenges lay ahead.

Though their interaction turned out differently than he anticipated, Sogeki still holds himself to a reserved stature. Rose could be a better friend and ally-- prolly more than anything else. Only time will tell.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: May i ask who is that jonin?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) shrugged and went back into her head. She needed to figure out what her aesthetics were going to end up like.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: uhm,i mean chunin
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's Miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh...the crazy one
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: So it's a chance to show them what skills you have and maybe impress a chuunin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) holds in a laugh at Najiro's description of a Chunin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Plus you get to see how you stack up to your peers
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, his mind instantly racing to address Rose&#39;s inquiry with his signature arrogance and pride. This challenge was an opportunity to assert himself and motivate others to step up.

<font color = white>&#34;The way I see it,&#34;</font> Sogeki began, his voice carrying an edge of aggressiveness and determination. <font color = white>&#34;We pool our ryo into a pot. The top three winners of the tournament not only claim their share of the pot but earn the right to brag. But here&#39;s the real deal,&#34;</font> he continued, his smirk widening as his arrogance shone through. <font color = white>&#34;Those top three? They&#39;re not safe. Anyone who didn&#39;t make it can challenge them. It&#39;s about more than winning; it&#39;s about proving you&#39;re the best.&#34;</font>

He paused for a moment, his gaze sweeping over the gathered peers. <font color = white>&#34;This tournament isn&#39;t just a chance to compete. It&#39;s a chance to show who&#39;s at the top and who&#39;s willing to fight to stay there,&#34;</font> he declared boldly, his tone challenging yet encouraging. <font color = white>&#34;So if you&#39;ve got any guts, if you think you&#39;ve got what it takes, step up. Train hard. Because this isn&#39;t just about dominance--it&#39;s about maintaining it.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s words hung in the air, a call to action wrapped in his trademark arrogance and pride. He knew his aggressive approach might rub some the wrong way, but he also understood the necessity of pushing his peers to strive for excellence, both individually and collectively.</font></font></font>

Higane&#39;s right hand meets her chin, slightly obscurring her lips as she chuckles.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Nice to meet you and I&#39;m sure it will be easy to remember your name cousin!&#34;</font> He yelled out a bit, looking towards his cousin&#39;s head.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) arrives on the scene of the streets, where it seemed students were eager to start some kind of something. As an elder of the village, it wouldn’t go unnoticed.

<font color = white>&#34;And what have we here?&#34;</font> He asks in a very skeptical tone, brow raised behind the darkness of the hood and mask</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Alright ima go hand in the scroll then.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (test
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the mask man stopping mid step with a scroll in his hand.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh...Hello.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) wafts his hand about his nose, not much liking the smell of cabbage. Thankfully the smell didn’t really stick.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello young....student. What is all of this commotion....&#34;</font> he trails off, looking at the gathered many before continuing. But as if it were a new statement. <font color = white>&#34;About.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uzumaki, Nakagawa (The short red-headed boy-Godlike2909) glanced toward the commanding man, giving him a once over before he lowered down onto the ground, taking a seat.

<font color = white>&#34;Some kind of tournament is happening or something&#34;</font> He said as he raised and lowered his shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked flinched a bit as the commanding man waved his hand, and they felt self-conscious about their smell for a moment.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh, We are organizing a tournament amongst us students.
Miss Botan is going to oversee it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) Walks up to the group after hearing about a tournament and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh the kids are working on a little tourny, isnt that just fun.&#34;</font>

He continued to watch them to see how it woud progress.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) itches his chin for a moment, before loooking between the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Botan also going to be providing a reward?&#34;</font> He looks over to the Jonin, who would know this wasn’t a spectator from within the village. But one sent by the Shogun for the youth</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...i wonder if i can get wooden shurikens
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) spots the figure and offers a head nod. If he was luck it would be enough to lure him over to his side of the crowd. Should the jounin warp to his position a few words would be exchanged as they whispered to one another. Maintain a sense of privacy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) folds his arms while side-eyeing the jonin next to him. They reeked of something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) walks off to the side, half listening to what's going on behind him, while also just observing the body of water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shook their head.
<font color = white>&#34;They didn&#39;t offer one, so we were just going to try to pull whatever resources we had for the top three.&#34;</font>
They looked at the ground for a minute as so many high-ranking people appeared out of nowhere.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) kept herself still in the distance, their eyes seem to perk over towards the crowd with curiosity, the scroll carrier in the distance particularly catching up their attention, eyes press gently in a squeeze, only to widden again. They've managed to catch up the youngling's attention for the time being itseems.

A ceaseless, unblinking stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) noticing the boy nod to him he quickly walked around the group and made his way clumsily towards him. Not cool or interesting in the least. No teleporting or cool moves used. just akward <font color = white>&#34;excuse me, pardon me, sliding by&#34;</font> words as he made his way through the crowd. He would stop by the boy and smile. <font color = white>&#34;Need something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says:  We have nine people so if everyone pitched in it should be a nice little reward...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would pass the scroll to the commanding man showing them all the names</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I don't have any ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I am a jonin a rank above Chunin its nice to see so many new faces around here feels like this year is going to be an interesting one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) had paid close attention to the jounin as he drew closer to the cluster of children from the north. His posture, demeanor and tone seemed far too mature to be a chuunin. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Kryu&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You tell me..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Earlier people called themselfs bitch
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) squints her eyes from afar, nothing escapes the young girls vision.. Let alone a big celebrity like Shion.

<font color = white>&#34;Holy crap! It&#39;s Master Shion! He&#39;s like famous you know!?&#34;</font> She shouted over the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And their mother being a hoe
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Oh...another of the famous ones?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) reads through the scroll swiftly, with something tucked between the parchment now

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I can watch then 500 ryo goes to the victor, 250 to the runner-up&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) asks: A tournament? Now?
