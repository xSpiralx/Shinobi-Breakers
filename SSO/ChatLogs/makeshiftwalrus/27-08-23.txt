<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) swiveled her eyes to the redhead for a moment.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) quirks a brow.

That kind of formal speak could only mean that she came from a noble clan.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s okay. You&#39;re the second one here, so second best is not too bad.&#34;</font> He admits, with a smile, before he steps forth to raise a hand. A fist bump is sought.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Hajime.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) observed the hand, though she made no attempts to meet it in the same manner. Though, amusement began to creep into her eyes, almost as if she was trying to unwrap a potential puzzle the greeting had presented her with.

<font color = white>&#34;I wasn&#39;t told this was a competition. I would have deigned to try harder if I had.&#34;</font>

Her gaze raised then, meeting the boy&#39;s own.

<font color = white>&#34;Kurorama.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) continues to keep his fist in front of her, though his brow quirks once he realizes that she was not accepting the greeting.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) cantered her head to the side.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah. That&#39;s what this is? Understood.&#34;</font>

A hand raised from within her cloak, extending out to finally meet Hajime&#39;s fist with her own. Though it wasn&#39;t in any particularly enthused manner-- more curious if anything.</font></font></font>

"I should make friends now.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am Uchiha, Kohaku- I feel out of place being so young, So Yuuto and Batsu, both kin... I bet we will pass with flying colors then.&#34;</font> He held himself with a standard about him, confident but not one to hide the fact he was still rather shy. if one couldn&#39;t be true to themselves then how could one call themselves an Uchiha? 

He&#39;d whip out a fan from his sleeve shaped like the symbol of their clan to cool himself, <font color = white>&#34;I just hope everyone shows promise this year, in and out of the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) squints and tries to examine Might Try. He looks rather...Plain.</font></font></font>

Alas, he did not possess Senju strength. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: There you go, it should be there now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) was the living embodiment of masculinity, power, and excellent taste in fashion.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) took out a marker and quickly added 'Medical Nin" Into the options of specs.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) sagged, defeated and deflated. He took a breath through his wide, flared nostrils, then turned and looked over his shoulder as intensely and confidently as possible, flashing a cheeky grin and batting his thickly lashed eyes while smirking devilishly. A thumbs up rocketed towards Raihara.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Thanks for your support!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) pauses for a moment, does she not notice him...? This lady&#39;s a Shinobi, no? If so, then she should be able to realize her precious weapon is about to be swiped away from her at any given moment! Shun&#39;Ichi hesitates, turning over toward his sister once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, that girl&#39;s a Shininijobi or whatever, right?&#34;</font> He aims to clarify, since Sakuya&#39;s been outside longer than he has, perhaps she was present whenever Komo demonstrated some sense of skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: Never needed one? You're tha strong?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t seem to care about the formal attire of his cousin, not even their young age. It should be pretty standard for Uchiha&#39;s to have some geniuses every now and then, and he was curious as to what Kohaku was capable of.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh trust me, I spotted quite a few promising... if not interesting, people already.&#34;</font> If both Kohaku and Batsu followed his gaze, they would see him glancing at Might, Try and then at both Hajime and Shishorama talking near the police officer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) eyes did not change from his normal blank, bored expression. Was this some kind of prank? His cold black eyes merely looked at Try, unblinking.

<font color = white>&#34;Support? Uh...Are you feeling okay?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: OH YEAH!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) delicately shakes his hand with the appropriate amount of strength. She took great care not to actually harm her future comrades and classmates. It was her duty to protect those weaker than her, and she&#39;d uphold that belief until the bitter end.

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: We should meet some of the other students.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) Kohaku didn&#39;t look much younger than Batsu, wondering just what he meant by feeling out of place. It felt natural for the Uchiha himself to finally become apart of the academy after the years of waiting. He&#39;d nod toward his clan member though, a head nod that usually gestures a greeting.

The statement about passing though the academy would resonate with him though, he&#39;d already expected the academy to be something he could easily maintain as his parents had made him study for as long as he could remember.

<font color = white>&#34;Pleasure to meet you Kohaku and yes... We will indeed exceed in this years academy.&#34;</font> he said, smirking.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) clicked her tongue, and idly produced a book from within her garment. Adding a pen to the mix, she began to scribble down on a seemingly blank page. Mysteries upon mysteries were written, surely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Well, I can introduce you to a few.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hummm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) scoffed at the declaration that he&#39;d beat herself and the other one. So, she did what anyone else in her position would. Push his buttons even harder.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... I&#39;ll just verbally agree to beat you then, I wouldn&#39;t want to touch your hand...&#34;</font> Her nose upturns just a tad, as though she would have caught something being too close to him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) stepped up to Kohaku and put his fists on his hips as he stared intently at the Uchiha trio just... breathing... waiting.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) covers her mouth... She forgot she was with children.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had no idea that he had been held back on.

He simply figured that despite being part of the Senju, she was a girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;No way. I don&#39;t accept hand outs.&#34;</font> 

Despite Hinoue&#39;s clear reluctance, he steps forth and raises a fist towards her, to seek a fist bump. Defiant eyes lock onto her own. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ...And I'd never lose to you, Shishorama..!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) spared a glance over toward Komo. Upon realizing that the older woman was insistent on tomorrow&#39;s start date, she clicks her tongue. Stepping further down the path, she turns her attention out toward the gathering.

<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Her statement seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as the optimistic one rapidly approached with a fist held out, intent on connecting some type of gesture that was evidently foreign to her with the confusion crawling across her visage. So, what could she do except from taking an offensive stance?!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to fight me right now?&#34;</font>

Legs set further apart, bending ever so slightly at the knees as all digits furl upon both hands - only for the index and middle to extend in an untrained stance. Unique to her lineage.</font></font></font>

Far from impressed with her polished combat stance that had been handed down across generations, he seems shocked, apalled even. He leans back a tad, as if now -he- were the one who could catch something from her.

He turns to face Kyoko on that note, and takes a step away from the Hyuuga, turning his back towards her.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, this was a fine day- Though they weren&#39;t nobles he&#39;d hope for the two to fair well in the academy, it&#39;s not that he looked down on them. It was simply instilled at a young age he was to protect them, simply because the nobles were born with strong traits and nothing more. Mental conditioning was strong in this one, though he wasn&#39;t ruled by it.

<font color = white>&#34;I do, too... Just don&#39;t push yourselves too much, hard work is fine until you pull a muscle. It happens to everyone eventually.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

After all, given the circumstances, he figured most folks around were probably younger than him.

Still, he managed to conjure up a sheepish grin in return, refusing to let rudeness take over. <font color = white>&#34;Kaoru.&#34;</font> He replied, giving a brief introduction..</font></font></font>

Despite the considerable age difference, she remained unfazed and undaunted by his company.

  She pulled out an attachment, a small spade like object that she wiggled into place on the top of her staff. The tool now resembles a hoe.

<font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Konoha&#39;s academy course. Ya&#39;ll be training to be shinobi that defends the lands of Fire, we shinobi are the heartline of this nation - Just like farmers.&#34;</font>

 Komo tosses her hoe hard towards the dirt behind the students, piercing and parting the dirt with force.

<font color = white>&#34;Instead of feeding mouths, we shinobi solves and prevent those farmer&#39;s problems from interrupting them making harvest.&#34;</font>

A hand extended facing the handed tool, as it suddenly came back to her grasp. <font color = white>&#34;To do that, we practice and master the use of all life force Chakra. Before we git to all that...&#34;</font>

The woman places the hoe back to her rear, facing the memorial.

<font color = white>&#34;This memorial is what we call tribute, tribute to all the shinobi that has succeeded their limits for their nation, some giving up their lives for you to even breathe and be born.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: A 'Nerd'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) innocently whistles as he reaches forth, while Hanako had ner back turned, to turn over some of her dice in order to lower the number.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Wh-..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: The game is over!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) asks: What good does asking a question do..?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Ah. Yes. You rolled 90.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Speakin is merely one of the many topics I was told to excel at. I suppose that does make me a 'Nerd', yes.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Nothing--
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Oh, I did?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: ..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Thanks for counting for me, friend. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That would've taken ages.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) snaps her finger into a thumbs-up.
<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;d have stepped forward. Good work.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) forces an awkward smile and glances away. 

<font color = white>&#34;N-no problem... My turn...&#34;</font> 

Friend??????? Someone had called him friend????????</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Uh oh.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I can't believe you would be so willing to count all those for me!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Y-yeah... That's what...friends do... Haha...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Okay.. ninety..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Even if we just met... 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How do I get that out of D-twenties?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That's an odd number.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's nine tens.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You have tens too?!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: He wouldn't carry all of those dice if he wasn't willing to count them...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: The D-20s have 10s within.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Officer, I think he might be doing an illegal dice operation.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: He's got way too many!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hmm..! Now that you mention it, it's a biiit odd..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's even too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: He's got odds and evens.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) couldn&#39;t believe it.

He gulps.

Was he about to take advantage of Hanako? He simply cannot look in her direction...Until she snitches on him to the police. He tenses, glancing at the dice, before he glances up at Kyoko.

<font color = white>&#34;N-no way! These aren&#39;t stolen..! I can definitely afford these dice on an oprhanage allowance... They&#39;re super used, see?&#34;</font> 

He sweats.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Sounds like it evened out, then.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Proceed.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It did. He's clean.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...An orphan? I see. That's unfortunate.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why so?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) scooped up the provided tens!

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry I doubted you! At first, it seemed a little odd, I will admit! But! Everything was even-stevens.. so..! Now to throw nine of these bad boys. Hyup!&#34;</font> 

She tossed them!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Because to my undestanding, a loving set of parents is ideal in raising a strong child.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Let's see.. if I put them all in rows of their numerical value and then count up the rows and multiply them by themselves and add up the results I get...!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ... ninety-two. That can't be right. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) turns towards Kurorama with a squint.

<font color = white>&#34;You callin&#39; me weak?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hum.. did I forget to carry a number?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Guess I'll count them the tried and true way..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: One.. two.. three..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Fourty-one.. fourty-two.. fourty-three..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) offeres a shake of her head.

<font color = white>&#34;No. Just that you&#39;ll have a harder time reaching the same plateau as your peers.&#34;</font>

For someone that boasted excellence in the wordy-stuff, she sure was sharp with her tongue. Though, it didn&#39;t seem like she&#39;d intended any offense.

<font color = white>&#34;Your apparent chosen rival is a Senju, is she not? That&#39;s quite a steep mountain to climb.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) leans over to snatch one of the dice from the tiled floor after the blonde tossed and counted them. Veins produce from her forehead as her pupils come into focus, staring intently at the die! Fingerprints, how often they were used- not a detail went overlooked.

<font color = white>&#34;.. Hrmm.. scuffed-up, and-.. cheaply made?&#34;</font> Her viseage goes lax as she tosses the D-20 back down. <font color = white>&#34;If he stole them, I doubt anyone cares.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [very well, sub 20, 70..]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [roll a d20 for new value]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) <font color = white>&#34;Chosen rival?&#34;</font>

He leans back a tad, and his resentment vanishes. He stares at her absent-mindedly for a few moments.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t have a chosen rival. I&#39;m going to be the best.&#34;</font> He states, bluntly, before finally returning to the game.

<font color = white>&#34;That means, beating everyone else. Clan, or no clan. No exceptions.&#34;</font>

A faint sigh leaves his lips in relief as he realizes that he was not about to be hauled in by the po-po.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright..! Hanako, you done counting? My turn yet?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Kyouko(The police chief-DatBooma) OOCs: (smh..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [roll a d20, officer!]
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hmm.. eighty-six.. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No.. eighty-four..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ah, then, I must have mistaken Shishorama's intent.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. yep.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: Oh, dang! Good roll!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I count eeighty four!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) hadn't realized she changed a die's value.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Your turn!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Got it..!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Just because Shishorame wants to make me her rival or something, it doesn't mean she'll be mine.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I must believe in the heart of the dice to win, it seems.....
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, wow. That's like.. five-six-ten, uh.. nineteen.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: It gets easier the smaller the rolls, huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) counts the dice multiple times, to ensure that he had in fact, gotten the right number. Also, to look for cheating opportunities.

None presented themselves..!

A smile is forced as he nods.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah. When someone loses, it&#39;s super easy to tell...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Got it! Okay.. time to roll this.. big handful of dice.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Let's go..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: ..!!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Heh..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Twelve. That's a good number.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I agree!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: That's an awful number!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: It's the amount I'd have if I got that extra dollar!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: That extra ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Unless you -lose.-
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: -..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) smiles triumphantly.

What were the odds of that?!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, wow. He's really good at this.. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Do you get bonus points for rolling the same number?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ack.. I tried!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: He skips a roll, more or less.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: To your pride, you do.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Wow.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Oh.. what happens if we both hit the same one?
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: I'm amazed someone like you has pride.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Pride is healthy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Kyouko(The police chief-DatBooma) OOCs: (more like slander noble..
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Pride is a disease.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Someone like me?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kyo(The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) OOCs: (Slander noble..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: What do you mean?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) checks the skin tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Pride Schmide! Let's keep going! 
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: A cracker.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Give me.. a three!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) sloooowly inched her sandal towards the dice, preparing to give it a nudge. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kyo(The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) OOCs: (Walk into MY village, call ME a cracker, fuck MY bitches 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) crosses her legs as she sits down, retrieving a flask from her haori.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) watches that one come, with glee. With joy. Finally, he would get the ten ryo that he had so desperately wanted.

Another successful hustle! Another successful bamboozle!

He extends a hand towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game, Hanako. Pay up. You get to keep your one special ryo, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) yawns. The nap he had was nice.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) asks: Hold it. Are you children gambling?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Congratulations.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) produced ten crispy (slightly moistened) bills from her stack. 
<font color = white>&#34;Yes..&#34;</font> 

A brush of thumb fans them out like playing cards. She takes her time inspecting their faces, their authentication codes as per mint standard, admiring their old-man faces. Reflected in their pale green eyes, she could see all the precious memories that brought them together; playing a complicated red-light green-light, and..

    ...and... 

.. actually, that&#39;s about it! Yep. Participation reward, and then the dive into her pocket because she had to go hear a speech. Good times. The best of times. She extended the bills to their new owner, entirely lacking in sadness, despite this departure. 

How could she feel disappointment, seeing the other kid look so giddy over receiving these funds?! Haa. That&#39;s probably the exact same face she wore when she first acquired them. Right?

<font color = white>&#34;.. take good care of these. Remember how good it feels.. to receive ten ryo. Take it from me. I&#39;ve learned.. it&#39;s a feeling that does not last forever.&#34;</font>

Winds thread through her blond locks as she turned her gaze to the sky, akin to a meditative Bodhisattva arriving at an epiphany. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I see. This decision has caused a severely traumatic scene to unfold.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Halt this.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Gamble with pretend money.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Boy, if you accept those funds, I will punish you thusly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) nods her head, content with the extended threat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Ehh? Aren't all funds made up?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: They're just paper someone drew faces and numbers on!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Besides. He's my friend, so I don't mind if he has them! We'll call it payment for playing a game with me.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Pretend money has no value in the real world.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: That is a bad mindset, girl.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) &#39;s eyes remain transfixed upon Hanako&#39;s demeanor and her apparent relationship with these bills, that had been acquired after such hard toil, a fierce game of red-light, green-light that was overly complicated but extremely fun. Even so, upon seeing the way that she stares at the money, he simply cannot feel as giddy and elated as he wanted to.

It seems like his plan to get her to go double or nothing, was quickly fading from his mind.

Could he summon forth the guts to take everything from her? To trick her into losing it all? To strip every single penny from her being?

Never had he hustled someone, and been called a friend for it!

He smiles awkwardly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey... Umm... Friend.. What were you going to buy with this money?&#34;</font> He questions, as he scratches his cheek and suddenly finds the water behind them extremely interesting. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) sagely nods as the results unfold before her. Watching as Hanako speeds through the seven stages of grief was a nostalgic one- she, too, learned the horrors of gambling the hard way. 

<font color = white>&#34;Mm?&#34;</font> She waved off the noble&#39;s concerns. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s only the ten ryo I gave them earlier. Besides- people don&#39;t realize the weight money has until its gone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Best to teach 'em early, mm'hm.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) offers a light huff, before looking over the woman beside her. It's hard to tell if she's checking her out or wondering what she'd look like on an operating table. Still, she looks at the children, watching them. Judging the boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) wouldn't think much of the noble's engaged staring; the meaning behind their gaze was unclear, but she wasn't looking for it. With a hum, she, too, directs her attention back on the pair as they resolve(?) their game.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) tilted her head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Uhhh... ten ryo is a lot. A pack of cookies and maybe a carton of milk? Some candy with the leftovers? It&#39;s fine! I probably don&#39;t need it! Eat enough sweets and-- did you know? Your teeth will fall right out when you least expect it.&#34;</font> 

She flashed the red-head a grin! 
There was a stalk lack of missing teeth there. 
In fact, they were in mint condition. 

<font color = white>&#34;.. they&#39;re a pain to grow back. A super major headache. Don&#39;t worry! I&#39;m better off without it. Already over it. More importantly-- weren&#39;t we supposed to be at the mansion? Or.. was that postponed?&#34;</font> 

She leeeeaned sideways, looking past him, trying to make out any crowds in the distance. Sadly, her visual range was severely limited. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [stark lack*]
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ten ryo can nearly afford one of the cheaper books in my usual bookstore.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) a-hems!
<font color = white>&#34;Actually, they switched locations. Follow the water and you&#39;ll find them.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kyo(The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) OOCs: (IS THAT THE GRIM REAPER?!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) grimaces faintly once he realizes that someone he had just hustled was grinning in such a pure manner, at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think your teeth would fall out from a few cookies.... Umm... I&#39;ll buy you some.&#34;</font> He offers, before turning towards the location that was being shown. 

<font color = white>&#34;We can have cookies and milk, to celebrate our new friendship. How&#39;s that sound?... Some other day, though.&#34;</font>

A smile forms, before he turns to walk towards the academy headmaster&#39;s location.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s find &#39;em!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: What he said!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Mmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: And we already started this a while ago and established a system to help. It just makes it easier.
<br><font color=green>*Tategama (The sarutobi kid-Dissolutechris90) says: This guy gets it.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Get Kurorama and Hanako first. It's kinda' my fault they're late.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Err.. I've never climbed a rock before.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Gotcha.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Sounds like a shi- Shucks deal on my end. About if you are able to do something crazy. Can't think of anything yet.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Do we stand on one another's shoulders?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) put his back to the wall, a little distance away from it. He crouched on the ground and adjsut his feet, both his hands were brought up. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll try to launch you as far as I can, make sure to grab the wall and continue climbing or go for Shishorama.&#34;</font> He was pretty strong, he didn&#39;t know how far they would go, but better than on their own.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: The task is laid out for you, how you get it done is how a shinobi completes their mission.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: Okay okay... I'll be your lackey for three days if I fail! How's that sound?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) turned and reached up on the cliff face for any sort of hand hold that would bare his weight even as he slid the fishing rod over his shoulder. He then took a step up, digging the toe of his sandal into the stone face and turning his foot so that he had more surface touching. With a hop he reached another hand-hold and began the systematic climbing of the cliff. He was warmed up now but he was also a little fatigued, so this was just as hard, if not harder, than the first level, and the stakes were much higher. 

Slowly, but surely he worked his way up to the next level. The distance was farther than before but the group was counting on him. Shishorama even cheered for him and let him make the climb first! She trusted him!

The youth winced and hissed as his forearms started to cramp up and his hands went numb with charlie horses but he continued on, stopping only to shake his hands when he felt confident he could hold himself up.

Once Try weakly pulled himself over the top he laid flat on his stomach and took big, gasping breaths for air.

A long moment later the fishing line and scarf were lowered down to the chill boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) doesn't grab her on the way up, no. She had been fired off with much too much force to try and slow her down. He could only watch as the pale girl shoots up and over him, to which he turns and waddles in place, determining where she would fall.

Her lightness worked to his advantage in this department. It was very simple to ease her falling into a simple motion, swinging himself around with the excess inertia and planting her firmly on the rocky, cliffside ground.

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tategama (The sarutobi kid-Dissolutechris90) asks: Is my brother up there?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I don't need a lacky.. But, we can work something out.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh.. a jumpy system. 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll use the fishing rod as a rope.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (to any of you who takes my help
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) peered to the cliffside, and then back to the two she&#39;d arrived with. Surely all three of them could simply jump up there, but... That wouldn&#39;t be in the spirit of the challenge.

<font color = white>&#34;You may go first... Hanako, they said?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Not today. I might need it..
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: ...Very agile-
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Besides.... What you did was a Shi...No Ninjutsu thing anyway or whatever, right? So it'd just show my skill if I could do it too.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (so you don't need to wait for my rp of throwing you up
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Right, enough sitting around.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That's probably for the best.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Go, team, go.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: You're not ready for it.
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Cmon A little louder!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Keep working on it, and maybe you will be.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm ready for it!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm ready for anything!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: You sure? Seemed pretty simple for yah..
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Go Team go! You can do it!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: C'mooooon, lemme try.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: So, Shisorama's catching you at the top, right?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Shishorama!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Yelling is undignified, though...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Negative. Focus on your task right now.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's right!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Your team is waiting.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I made it up and I've got this fishing line!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'll catch- Yes, Try?!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: Damnit... And-- "Team"?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'm going to pull that lighter guy and then we'll pull people up.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You have a fishing line?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) watched as the newcomers arrived.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh boy, maybe this means we can breathe for a minute.&#34;</font> he says in a hushed tone, watching the group begin to stratigize their climb. They&#39;d then think about the climb he was about to embark once more, having to face his fear of heights head on.

<font color = white>&#34;O-okay...&#34;</font> he mumbles, turning to face the cliff&#39;s edge once more. He&#39;d look around for those helping the others, aiming to use their strength to aid his efforts.

<font color = white>&#34;P-please don&#39;t drop me.&#34;</font> he gulps, sweating as he continued on up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: It's not mine!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's so clever!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Look around you.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: I wish I thought of that...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: It's that chill young guy's!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: He came prepared.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I need to take more notes!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm ready to cach you guys!
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: Screw dignity! Cheer for em loud- Oh seems they are takin the.. taller route- let me just,  get back up there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) made it to the top, now, next to her brother. She looked to help Yuuto ascend himself, but noted that he had gone all the way down to the bottom again. With a sigh, the dancer realized just how long this exercise would take and laid down on the rocky mountain top in exhaustion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Cracking his neck he walks up to the mountain once again, digs his hands into the earth and starts to climb. It seemed his efforts to help were largely ignored, ah well it didn't matter. He had his rest and with that he was off. Grabbing rock after rock he'd push up with his legs and scale the mountain just as he had before. Unlike the others he didn't need help.

Slowly but surely he'd make it to the top, that's all that really mattered to him right now.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) asks: eh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) used the fishing line and the scarf to climb. Using his stamina , he focus on the task at hand. He did not need any distractions. To complete the task and forget  all the nonsense behind him. That was the easy enough to do. No hesitation or worry.

Climbing up carefully using the fishing rod and scarf he noticed that this was not bad after all.<font color = white>&#34;This was too much excerise jeez...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#884250>Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) starts to climb, ending up near Try <font color = white>&#34;Ill help ya pull em up!&#34;</font> the boy says excitedly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) asks: Where you...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Make sure you aim straight up, Yuuto! I wouldn't want to see them drop!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) squints . . .</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I would land on my feet even if I fell.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) looks down at the bottom and then to his sister, <font color = white>&#34;Surprised you were helped. Congratulations.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) helped the wandering boy and then the chill young boy up with the fishing line and scarf combination. He then choked up on the fishing rod so that all those up there could pull together on the fishing line.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;re ready to help up whoever&#39;s next! Just don&#39;t try to climb up two at a time or you might snap the line!&#34;</font> He tossed the scarf/fishing line saddle down to Momoko.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: She's a cat!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Meow.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Not a good cat!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: Oh. I have a fishing pole as well!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I see. I'll try harder next time.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) clasped her hands!

<font color = white>&#34;<i>O-kaaay</i>... so we&#39;re jumping it! We&#39;re really doing this. Huh. I, uh, I swam like twice before arriving here, soooo sorry if I&#39;m a little heavy! Water-logged.&#34;</font> 

As she stated as much, she took some generous steps back. <font color = white>&#34;Oh-- and slippery. I apologize in advance if I slip and knee you in the throat, nose, and or forehead in the process! The Officer&#39;s to blame. She took us everywhere-- even through a river-- trying to find this place!&#34;</font> 

One self-deprecating chuckle later and she&#39;s ready to give it a go. From the edge of the river, she fell into a sprint, her sandals clacking and crunching across the sediment, leaving a trail of wet footprints in her path. 

<font color = white>&#34;CatchmeCatchmeCatchme--!&#34;</font> 

She skips a jump, expecting the confident boy to give her the boost she needed to go flying up the elevation-- and to be perfectly honest, she had zero idea what comes after that, since she got a bit distracted! Wait-- there&#39;s a fishing line? 

If so, she&#39;d reach out to grab that and or the cliff-side. Whichever came first!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Two fishing lines then!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: Why are you surprised?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We can really speed this up.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: I'm pretty. Who wouldn't help me?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) looked downward once more, watching the others help each other before wandering over to help Try and the other Lad. He could at least pull with the bit of strength he DID have, even if it wasn&#39;t a lot.

<font color = white>&#34;Let me help, too... I&#39;m not the strongest physically but I&#39;m not useless at pulling.&#34;</font> The Uchiha stated, he got up easy but he was going to pull his weight in this exercise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) follows suit, but... The problem still lies in the fact that the punk never got the chance to swipe the Chuunin&#39;s staff... Oh well, there&#39;s always next time, plus, his sister isn&#39;t around to be shocked or poked with it, so there&#39;s no fun in taking it now.

Well, assuming that Komo won&#39;t allow him to even consider grabbing the staff unless he gets through the &#39;&#39;<i>teamwork</i>&#39;&#39; bit, he inhales sharply, calling out to the two siblings.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey! I&#39;m coming up after yah!&#34;</font> The Boy unveils his scarves, placing rocks between them to form a sling, he spins the scarves about before launching them up, <font color = white>&#34;Grab &#39;em and dig em into the wall!!&#34;</font> He commands, he wasn&#39;t able to gauge their prowess, but judging from the fact that they&#39;re up there and he&#39;s down here, it&#39;s a well aligned gamble.

<font color = white>&#34;Maybe these clothes weren&#39;t a bad choice...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: It was the exact thought on my mind.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (I'll RP after Yuuto)
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: They'll do anything for a pretty face. Poor Uchiha...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Fishing wire...Not what I expected from joining the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) nodded before removing the fishing rod from his back.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll cast down then.&#34;</font> he says before pulling the rod back, throwing it forwards to cast the line down the wall!

<font color = white>&#34;G-grab it!&#34;</font> he&#39;d call down to whoever wanted to ride the fishing pole express.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Someone's arrogant.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Wait... clothing...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well, it's only the first day.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: I this is only day one I ponder what the future holds.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t expect the girl to be wet, but hey, he would help her anyway. The moment she got close, his hands would go under her feet quite easily before launching her upwards towards Shishomaru&#39;s general direction. <font color = white>&#34;Next one!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is conversing but does extend over to clench the scarf between his fingers. He leans over and tugs, pulling back so as to give the punk at least some measure of a foundation to climb on.

<font color = white>&#34;Dig them in with what, stranger? No, you will climb and do so quickly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Isnt going to be boring.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) laughs a bit.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) unwraps his Kimono&#39;s sash, he could use this to help pull people up, too.

<font color = white>&#34;This should work.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Ah- Maybe throw it down to the lass helping people from the bottom!
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: ...Somehow-
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Mmm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) <font color = white>&#34;Hmm.&#34;</font> She lazily caught the scarf flung over her, and held it with not nearly the same conviction as her brother. She rolled over and laid on the scarf, trapping it under her body and between her legs as she scooted behind her brother, acting as an anchor to prevent him from sliding back, as long as he kept himself from sliding forward. It was a little extra weight for him, but...

He could handle it, huh?

<font color = white>&#34;Better hurry.&#34;</font> She called. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m letting go in fifteen seconds.&#34;</font>

Maybe it was her idea of a motivational speech?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) observed the given trajectory of the girl-turned missile for the moment, all the way to her zenith. The wailing was amusing enough it drew a gentle smile across her lips, but she didn't bother to voice her amusement in any way. Rather, she wandered over to take her spot after Hajime, waiting for his own leap to either soar, or flop.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes a deep breath.

Once Hanako manages to rise up to the next level of the cliff, he suddenly steps forth. With practiced movements, he leaps onto Yuuto and he is boosted upwards...!

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s go...!&#34;</font>

An arm extends, to try to reach the cliff-side, or Shishorama&#39;s hand... Despite the fact that he didn&#39;t actually want to accept her help.

Hopefully, he wouldn&#39;t hesitate in reaching for her and fall to a grave injury!

He was also wet, due to the river they swam through.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With an eager expression on her face, Shisho stood at the edge of the cliff, her eyes fixed on Yuuto as he prepared to boost the first person up. Her smile grew wider as she watched Hanako approach, pleading to be caught as she was sent soaring towards the ledge.

Shishorama extends her arms out toward the girl and catches her with effort. Gently placing her to the side, she awaits the next person to be assisted. 

This pattern would continue until every single student made their way up the 'mountain'.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (Shishorama, Hajime rp'd, you can get on that too
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (that RP  shall encompass all incoming students)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (very well, saves time
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Nice to see you here, Hajime!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (We got the double fishing line elevator up on this end)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (and 5 people pulling)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (So you can just poof up here)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: yep
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Why's what?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says:  Nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Thanks, I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: No problem!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hehe...! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) took her turn once Hajime was seen to the top of the plateau. There was very little fanfare as far as she was concerned, her movements almost painfully efficient. One might even have gotten the impression she could scale the wall rather easily without any assistance at all.

And yet, she boosted through Yuuto's assistance, and extended both arms to grasp onto Shishorama, the zenith of her jump only barely missing the height of the ledge. Perfectly calculated to be easy, and swift.

A nod was offered to the pair then, even if she had to lean over the edge a bit to show her gratitude to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) frowned without much to do in this case, it was mainly just watching as he trained with his chakra. it wasn&#39;t the worst thing but he was wondering what to do while he waited for people to pull up.

On the upside when there was someone to pull wwith five people pulling it asn&#39;t too difficult even if he lacked raw strength. As he heard someone whisper he&#39;d nod toward the Wandering Child.

<font color = white>&#34;Still would be easier if I could use chakra to help in this case.&#34;</font> He doubled down on that aspect.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Chakra..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gave a thumbsup to the eccentric girl after she reached the top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: meh
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: . . .Yes, Chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Alright!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) seemed entirely unafraid of zooming right into being tossed several meters into the air. An underdeveloped aversion to danger perhaps. Who knows! 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, wow. I made it! Thanks!&#34;</font>

After getting properly yoinked and placed to the side like luggage (with a fragile label on it), she found herself delivered to the next stage! A system of fishing line pulleys meant to lift them the rest of the way. Uh--

<font color = white>&#34;Are these really strong enough to hold an entire person? Eh. We&#39;ll see!&#34;</font>
 
As the designated crash test dummy, she twisted a double-wound grip around the fishing lines and held tight!

<font color = white>&#34;<i>O-kaaaay</i>, reel me up!&#34;</font> 
She lets them work their give-man-strong magic!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [five-man-strong*]
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Alright guys. In sync.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The ole HEAVE HO!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes steps towards the fishing line and merely observes for a few moments, to see if it truly worked exactly like it was supposed to.

<font color = white>&#34;Huh... This is pretty smart... If the fishing line holds, that is.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Heave!!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) began tugging back on the rod with EVERYTHING he had.

<font color = white>&#34;Lets do this!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) rolled his eyes, abjuring to their remarks. Though, it seemed they in fact weren&#39;t on the strong suit, food for thought he supposed.

There was an advantage to this feat, however; Shun&#39;Ichi was going to do something unorthodox to his experience: he was attempting to mimick Komo&#39;s Body Flicker, albeit with only the process of controlling chakra.

Assuming the lady wouldn&#39;t simply show him again, Shun&#39;Ichi improvised.
He remembers reading a bit on the tiger seal; the de-facto sign to focus chakra within the human body; Shinobi works was more his sister&#39;s talent, however the prospect of chakra control always intruigued him.
Time to display that feat in full flux; with his feet upon the wall and the centre of balance upon his heart--Shun&#39;Ichi placed his index and middle fingers on each hand together, and closed his eyes.
Five seconds pass, he recognizes a spark of energy within his belly, chakra.
Ten seconds now, each second is taken spreading chakra throughout his body, before sending it primarily to his legs.
Five more seconds, he feels a sensation unfamiliar to his physical body; and it provides slack for his heart, the chakra to his feet seem to be stitching him to the mountain.

Shun&#39;Ichi wastes zero time, he rushed up the mountain all the way to a point just short of the peak, he shifts around glncing at the Chuunin once more.
<font color = white>&#34;Still think I&#39;m not up to par yet?!&#34;</font> He goads, though while doing so, he recognizes a fault in his prowess: <i>Reserve.</i>

Immediately the boy scrambles his hands onto the wall, realizing how much strain he&#39;s just placed on his body with that simple feat. He&#39;s in a huff, relying on his own desperation and the Kaguya duo&#39;s willingness to hang on to remain.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Aa--Aaughh, these rocks are a little scrape-ish!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: But I'm fine!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) assumed Chakra was common knowledge and not just horded clan knowledge, taught to their offspring.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled, trying to work in sync with the other four members of his moving squad. They had done the hard work getting up there manually and now some ingenuity would help with the others.

He groaned as Hanako let them reel her up without her own help. He was expecting the people to climb up as well, but with two lines it should have been possible.</font></font></font>

It simply hadn&#39;t occurred to her that climbing along was an option! Despite enduring bumps and shoving away from the wall where she could to avoid injury!
 
<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t act like a fish! Got it! I&#39;ll be as land-creature as I can be! Uh-- my hands get pruny in water, gah, I hate that!&#34;</font> 

How was she so heavy? Well-- she was drenched from, again, going through the river twice to get here! 

<font color = white>&#34;Wait--&#34;</font>

Ah. Finally someone said it out loud. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m supposed to climb? Ohh...&#34;</font>

She found a nice little set of edges to hook her fingers and sandal-tip onto and started to support some of her own weight along the way. <font color = white>&#34;Ah, hey. It&#39;s a little faster this way. You&#39;re really smart, handstand guy!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

He had the stamina to help so many people, but even so, he hadn&#39;t thought this through on needing to go back up.

Well, that was his duty... and so, he starts climbing back up, holding back cusses every step of the way, but the time he reached the ledge, he was already extending his hand to Shishomaru. <font color = white>&#34;Need some help...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) scratched her head as the scarfed boy declared his ambitions. She indeed saw some potential in the boy&#39;s chakra control, however potential is just that... Potential.

<font color = white>&#34;Nope.&#34;</font> A single word was said, before she looked over towards the others still working.

She would look around at the class of students, seeing most at the top. She folded her arms on top of her vest as a breath squeaked passed her teeth.

<font color = white>&#34;I see that most of you understood the exercise. A lesson as well as a workout to go along with it. So, lets call it a day right now.

Tomorrow, we&#39;ll work on your mental strengths to go with your physical strength. This is the beginning of Chakra. Now climb down and rest up tomorrow. You all are gonna need it for what comes next.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Suddenly, several clouds of smoke would appear as several mattresses poofed into existence to soften the fall for the students.

He drops, to his assumed safety, but closes his eyes once he&#39;s in the air!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) drug his hand across his chin at Komo&#39;s response. He gracefully knocked the rocks from his scarves before wrapping them across his neck. He was gonna gesture more of the fuck you&#39;s to the Chuunin, however, his ashen-haired compatriot&#39;s question stopped him.
<font color = white>&#34;So she&#39;s the instructor huh... And... Well, no not really..&#34;</font> He choked himself for a quick moment, if he wasn&#39;t attempting to impress her, then he just... Really wanted to know what was up with her staff is all.

Though all that thinly veild contempltation was snuffed out by the acrobat&#39;s twin, <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s called baby fat, boney, it goes away after you get older..&#34;</font> He&#39;d excuse, climbing up fully onto the mountain top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Well, it all worked out!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) <i>hurls</i> toward the ground with a smile! She was tough, she could take it! Or..so she thought! Just when she thought she was about to splatter against the stone below, a mattress of all thing materializes to break her fall. With a loud <font color = white>&#34;Oof!&#34;</font> Shishorama looks around, confused.

<font color = white>&#34;I knew I was tough...but this? It&#39;s unprecedented...what else am I capable of...?&#34;</font> The Senju looks at her hands, amazed by her newfound power.

The ability to summon mattresses....a truly formidable talent...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) hops down off the other lad, <font color = white>&#34; I still didn&#39;t get your name.&#34;</font> He stated brushing himself off as if putting his Kimono back in the proper place, <font color = white>&#34;Yet you carried me the entire way- Ah.

Nice to meet you, Rango&#34;</font> He noted, wrapping his sash back on to complete his appearance. His black eyes glanced towards the mountains, he&#39;d conquer the mountain eventually. Not today, but eventually.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hehe, and I was the first one down.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I guess I&#39;ll try.&#34;</font> he says, leaping down onto the summoned mattress. 

<font color = white>&#34;P-please don&#39;t disappear!&#34;</font> he cried, falling down the cliffside.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: That's it!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Trust in the power of fluff!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) decided to chill out at the second floor for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Be unafraid!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: "Hey Shishorama, how bad was that?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Not bad at all!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) asks: Am I... D-dead?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I don't know.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We haven't exchanged names yet.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm Might, Try!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...Bony?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: If you're talking, you should still be among the living.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: I'm Sarutobi, Yakeru, i-it's nice to meet you Try.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) nods, releasing the scarf officially now that they were right there alongside them. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you should seek to prove something anyhow.&#34;</font> If only to at least make certain they know who they were dealing with.

<font color = white>&#34;You have a name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: ....!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: That's right, I'm alive!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Nice ta meetcha.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Bo-Ney, you're too skinny, and too tall.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: And.. Name's Shun'Ichi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) actually swanton bombs herself off the cliff without restraint. 

Oddly enough, upon colliding with the safety rectangles arranged at the bottom of the cliff, one could&#39;ve sworn her frame deformed like elastic. Only to snap back and toss her squarely onto her face. Eating sediment. 

And there--! She lay. Silent--
<font color = white>&#34;..aaaa--I think I was first.&#34;</font> 

--not silent. Oddly energetic, even, entirely ignoring the impact pains!

<font color = white>&#34;Were you keeping track? I, uh, forgot to.&#34;</font> She glanced over her shoulder to the red head, wondering if he managed to arrive undamaged. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Kedoiiin, Shun'Ichi.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Mmm..
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: . . . All this climbing made me tired...

<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Kedoiin, -iin not -iiin.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Sleep well.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: This conludes today's lesson. Be prepared tomorrow.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had closed his eyes...!

He was simply unaware of her elasticity.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh... Kurorama! Who was first? Who won?&#34;</font> He questions, taking steps towards the Senju to stare into her eyes very intently.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Alright!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm gonna go train!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: Oh.. W-wow.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: .. Train? After all that?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: You should let your body rest.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) watching as the magic beds started to appear out of nowhere takes a sigh of relife. It seemed as if the Chunnin was prepaired for just about anything. Worse however it seemed it was encouraging people to jump down the mountain. Quick as it might have been he was not about to temp fate.

Stepping down back upon the earth climbing down would prove to be as much as a challenge as going up. yet same as before he climbed at his own pace.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I wasn't able to climb the entire way up without help.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I need a bath. My shoulder's all.. achy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) casually walked straight into the river.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: That isn't-...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Since I wasn't able to climb all the way up, I'll have to do twenty laps around the school yard!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says:  Yeah it is.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Clean. Ahem.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) looked at her body. She was tall for her age-- but that just made her age harder to guess. There was no beating the lithe allegations, though.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s easiest to dance when you are light and graceful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: What a strange name.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hot? Don't worry. A cold bath is fine too.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: You've never taken a river bath before?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That's true, the less you are dependant you are with your teammates, the more you can do within a team.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Tell us who won though, Kurorama..! Who landed first?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Very.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: What does Shun'Ichi mean?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: But injuring your body without proper rest will cause you to be more of deadweight for them next time.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hey, yeah! You pay attention to everything! 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I believe you both landed at the same time.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Ack! A tie?!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: ..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: We've hit the three together again.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: What a curious coincidence, isn't it?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It seems like it...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) snapped her fingers.

<font color = white>&#34;Brave one. How interesting. Are you brave?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Tie breaker. Let's do it again.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: How about we do something else?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I understand what you mean.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: STOP ARGUING! The answer is simple!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: -I- made it down first!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Take a nap, after your nap. You'll be stronger than if you trained.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I was thrown after all!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Stop buttin' in, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: This was between me and Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Like hell it's stra--! Oh, um.... I'unno, Mr. Senju gave it to me, not my mama.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Right!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) yells: Trust those words from a former aspiring althete!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I put my butt in however I like!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Umm...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Shishorama, chill.

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Maybe tomorrow, I'll hold a contest..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Next time.. next time I'll throw myself. 
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) asks: What was your first name?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) seems off-put, <font color = white>&#34;A bastard, to a Senju?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: But you do quack, if I am to infer that statement correctly.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: What I do when I feed the ducks is my own business.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: They're good listeners.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Hm. Feeding ducks.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) did the opposite of Might, Try. She was not calm. She was never calm.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I've never fed a duck before, they're not specimen within my family's aviary.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: They enjoy bread and onigiri.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Your family's...aviary?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Not the spicy kind.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) asks: So uh... What are your names?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Ducks and I have a lot in common,  then!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: You should be careful with breads, and rice. Both are unhealthy for birds.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'm Hajime. Kibo, Hajime.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Don't be silly! If they didn't like it, they wouldn't come back for more.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I will!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Seeds? Err. Do they sell those?
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: My names Y-Yakeru. Sarutobi, Yakeru.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) wrinkled her nose.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) looks at the optimistic boy. The fat kid was clearly over three hundred pounds...

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, thanks! Believe it or not, I used to climb trees. My dad always had me do it because when I got to the top of the tree, the tree would suddenly collapse down! Everytime, isn&#39;t that weird?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Thanks!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) steps forth, and prepares himself to boost the fat. He widens his stance, and joins both hands to create a makeshift platform.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) agrees, <font color = white>&#34;All the time they do. It is their job.&#34;</font> It is what they are going to be doing, too. That was never a suden, revealed thing.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I'll be sure to get a drink and remain hydrated!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Beating the clans isn't nessesary for this, just make sure you don'y pull a muscle....

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) chuckled as he wasn&#39;t phased by the fat kid&#39;s weight. One way or another, he was gonna help them. <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry too much about it, I just hope you can catch yourself if I manage to do this.&#34;</font>

Then he looks at Hajime. <font color = white>&#34;You sure? I was gonna throw him so you could catch him, but that works too.&#34;</font> Unless Hajime changed his mind, he would start climb up. They can help the kid up a bit at a time.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. not the river water though, actually, since that's where fish pee.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) dropped back to the ground and assumed the same position as Hajime, the moment the kid came by to use him as a plataform, he would help launch him up.</font></font></font>

Just plain magistry?!

Nah, probably a form of Ninjutsu, some weird lesson or what not, either way, nothing he's interested in--Shun'Ichi begins to focus his chakra onto his feet again, attaching himself to the mountain slightly better than the previous time.</font></font></font>

Then, she'd stand herself next to the edge, prepared to assist! Maybe.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) blinked several times at the sudden departure of the smart attentive one. How did they-- where did they-- oh! Oh. They&#39;re on the cliff. Somehow. When did they get there? 

She wandered over to the cliff, tried to hook her fingers onto an edge-- only to find them slipping right off, unable to find friction nor purchase. Too slippery right now.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: I don't think that's our usual clans...

<font color = white>&#34;For the academy!!!&#34;</font> He barked as he took his first step, his belly jiggled as his belly button popped out from his tank top as his flabby arms would blow against the winds.

He leaped! His right foot going to the overconfident kid and his other to the sable haired youth. As for the optimistic red head, he&#39;ll have the middle part.. Whatever he can grab, it seems.

Orphans did not necessarily get to eat too much and he wasn&#39;t the strongest. But he wasn&#39;t about to back down from a challenge...! Alas, when the fat comes running, he finds himself completely unable to lift them. Thus, he finds himself suddenly...

Crushed under the weight of the fat.

Just like every other person in his squad.

She poked her head around the cliff&#39;s corner.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you okaaay, friend? Need the water now? Are your bones unsnappened? Or do you need a dip?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

God, he was tired, maybe this hadn't been a good idea.

Contact was made and he was the first one to buckle under the weight, even Kohaku who he knew hadn't managed to climb up by his own had managed to put more into this than him.

He was crushed.

So this was what it was like to get charged by an angry walrus.

Trapped unable to move.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, crap baskets-&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Y-yeah, they get pruny..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hm.. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) looks down at her perfectly unpruned hands. Not a single wrinkle was there despite soaking. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I.. think I see the problem.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: It's not happening!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I think... We're talking about different problems..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) grabbed ahold of Kamiya&#39;s leg, in an attempt to pull her over the edge and carry her down alongside him. This time around, he attempted to practice what Kumo had attempted when she stopped Kamiseito and himself from colliding.

<font color = white>&#34;Wanna see how brave I can really be...?&#34;</font> The boy&#39;s face imply curled into a crescent, holding her tightly while chakra rushed to his feet; he attempted to flare it wildly enough for the girl to realize he was attempting something heavily reckless that&#39;ll injure them both.
It was a bluff either way, he definitely didn&#39;t have enough chakra to attempt a Body Flicker, not just yet...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I'm getting crushed under the problem...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) watched it all unfold from her bird's eye view. It was like a car crash happening in slowmotion, and she couldn't look away, forced to see every single detail as the lardness himself collided with the trio. It was beyond awful.

...It almost made her want to chuckle a little. Silly antics, though.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Oh, right. The other problem!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll, uh..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) glanced around for-- 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, right. Sand sticks to things..&#34;</font>

She pops a squat, smacked her hands in the sediment, and then wandered on over. Ready to try and help the chunky lad up, if need be, despite having nothing more than sand, noodle arms and a dream. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) The combined effort of the three wasn&#39;t enough it seems. Bloat Max was now on top of the three, opening his eyes as he noticed he was slightly higher off the ground with the help of the platinum blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah! You guys did it! I&#39;m on top of the mountain! This is so great!&#34;</font> The fat kid was thrilled. He quickly lifted himself off of the three, not noticing that he was barely a few feet off of the ground. He would run off overjoyed.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m definitely going to be a genin! Thanks guys for your help!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I found the grit required to aid you.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You did great, friend!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) is utterly unperturbed, single minded, one might say; she seemed to have little regard for her own body. While he attempted to bring chakra to his feet and threaten some kind of manuever, the Kaguya&#39;s leg is grabbed. There&#39;s a little unearthly grace and bending of joints as she bent in on herself and aimed to deliver a powerful strike to his nose.

<font color = white>&#34;Think you can insult me and get away with it?&#34;</font> She challenged, more of a brute than a graceful acrobat at this rate.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I've never seen someone complete the exercise that way! 
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) says: Aren't I a prodigy?? Of course I am.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) The only thing he managed from that position was a grunt and finally... a gasp for some sweet... sweet air! Then his hand was lifted, giving the fat kid a thumbs up.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) rolls onto his back with a pained expression, before he glances up at Hanako and forces a grin along with a thumbs up.

<font color = white>&#34;T-thank you, friend..! I&#39;m fine.. I&#39;m fine... Thanks for getting him off us..&#34;</font> He coughs a few times, clearly having some difficulty with his breathing still.

He remains on the ground. 

<font color = white>&#34;Y-yeah... You&#39;ve completed the exercise so you can go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You made it up and back to the bottom in like one second flat!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: I'm back-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) ventured over to catch the redhead by his ankle. With her persistently gritty fingers, she proceeds to drag him to the nearest water source, and unless he resisted, unceremoniously drag him in. 

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll fix you right up. Uh-- you know how to float, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) laid in the dirt crator, in pain. He knew that would happen, but he wasn&#39;t going to let the others do that alone. All he could do was rub his rib cage.

<font color = white>&#34;I think... my ribs decided to invert. Tell my family it&#39;s too late for me.&#34;</font> Then he plucked a dandelion and played dead.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, yeah- Good job, you&#39;ll pass in no time.&#34;</font> He stated to Max before playing dead once more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (There we go, profile FINALLY fixed up...)

<font color = white>&#34;H-huh, what?&#34;</font> 

He&#39;s dragged into the water, and instantly sinks to the bottom unceremoniously.

Bubbles rise to the surface.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) noticed he lacked the ability to float aaaaand held his torso up by a bundled wad of his shirt in her grips. 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, dang. You&#39;re really bad off. Here. Have some air too.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) felt his eyes widen slightly in a sudden notice, seems that Kamiya was less inclined with bluffs over the overbearing insult she&#39;s apparently been dealt. The strike was evaded only slightly, but the sentiment and display of strength was clear.

Instead of continuing to fight against the girl, Shun&#39;Ichi simply released her, pushing her body aside suddenly before launching himself away, letting her freefall the rest of the way--she&#39;ll be fine, probably.
<font color = white>&#34;The hell&#39;s got you all in a huff!? What do you mean I insulted you? What&#39;d I say?!&#34;</font> His voice was loud, but his confusion was genuine, in his eyes, the guyish name remark wasn&#39;t as hard hitting as she was displaying. He felt the academy instructor&#39;s chakra moving away, out of his range and dissapating.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah- Aw damn it! You distracting me allowed her to get away! The hell Kamiya?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) is not dropped like a ragdool. The girl managed to make an almost impossible reach to the mountain, and slid down it to meet him at the platform.

The assault doesn&#39;t end. A single step is followed by a jab toward his gut.

<font color = white>&#34;You know exactly what you said!&#34;</font> She shouted, unforgiving.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: A little rough, but nothing a little soak can't fix.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll never understand why people ditch their clothes..
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Walking around in heavy, wet clothes is how you get chafed and rashes.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) heard the shouts and with another grunt, pushed himself off the wall... stepping back so he could look up. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, everything alright up there?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Huh.. they don't feel that much heavier when I do it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) spun on her feet as an apparent commotion sounded behind her! Oh dear, she'd happened upon a fight in awfully close proximity, and opted to skip backwards, over the edge to avoid coming into further contact with it.

It wasn't her problem after all.</font></font></font>

Had he drowned?

<font color = white>&#34;Ow..&#34;</font>

He rubs at his ribs after a brief moment.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: Yesterday.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. with his fragile bones.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It helps.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: It doesn't.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It doooes.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Maybe it was in a magical hot spring.

The advantage of Kamiseito distracting her allowed him to gain proper ground and distance between the duo.

<font color = white>&#34;No, I don&#39;t yah bonehead! Now hurry up and tell me so I can knock some sense into yah!&#34;</font> He proclaims middair, twirling a bit before landing on soft ground.

<font color = white>&#34;This is your fault, Seito.&#34;</font> She mumbled, peering down at her prey with dangerous, red eyes. For just a moment, he received a breather. Slim, rounded shoulders rise adn fall with every breath, each one longer than the last as she stilled her racing, adrenaline-fueled heart.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) raises a hand.

After having been there for a bit, it&#39;s apparent that his fingertips had gotten slightly pruny.

<font color = white>&#34;It kinda&#39; hurts. Mm... Y-yeah, I think I&#39;ve got it.&#34;</font> He declares, deciding that he had to man up.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Out ya&#39; go.&#34;</font> In a few strokes of her free arm, she drags him to the shore, where he&#39;d be free to hoist himself out at his leisure. As for her, well, she exits the water and takes a new position beside the Senju. Over the course of about twenty seconds, there were no longer any beads speckling her skin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Today was fun, huh?

She probably hasn&#39;t calmed down, but then again, what did he say that upsetted her so.

He didn&#39;t use chakra this time, getting the feeling he&#39;s going to have to recover slightly in order to flee again.

<font color = white>&#34;And can probably wear you out before you knock me out... Regardless, what did I say?&#34;</font> He questions again, this time showing vulnerability rather than defensiveness, being at her mercy while climbing, subject to any maleficence she may provide.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: My parents wouldn't!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: We learned how to use pulleys and, uh, throw each other. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Skills we will need in the future for sure.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Doubtfully.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) randomly chimes into the conversation and fades back out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) manages to hoist himself up after a few moments, with a few winces here and there. The fat had been extra fat, after all.

He&#39;s immediately twisting his shirt, trying to get extra moisture out of it until he glances at Hanako with a quizzical expression.

<font color = white>&#34;You mind lending me your towel?&#34;</font> He asks.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I had fun.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) tilted her head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Huh? Just air dry. It only takes a minute.&#34;</font> 
She said it as if it were common sense. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watches the dancer and the punk's interaction with some interest for now, at the very least hoping that there wouldn't be any violence among classmates. Unsure if it happened already since it was out of his sight before.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: There's something about being sore from hard exercise that just feels good.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I really feel like I accomplished something.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Er. Hard exercise?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Yeah. Scaling the cliffs.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) stomped a loose rock, sending a shower of pebbles down on Shun'ichi, his latest words only inflaming her scorn.

They were lucky she was tired from climbing the rocks.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ah.
<br><font color=teal>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) whispers: Pulling Hanako up.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares down at his completely drenched self.

He waits approximately sixty seconds, before he glances up at her.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s not happening. Did you...?&#34;</font> 

A brow quirks.

Bizarre!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) did not speak further on the topic, her lips just pressed together in a thin line.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Oww owwwiwowwowowowow...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) was also questioning what he said, didn&#39;t he just comment on how they were siblings? Then she snatched him up in some weird sort of way, then he turned to Try.

<font color = white>&#34;You should&#39;ve been here to lift the fat kid that made my rib cage concave.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I don't believe she has a towel.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Ah, sorry Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Next time! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) although the rocks weren't large enough to cause massive damage, it roughed his tender child skin quite up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Hopefully, we failed terribly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) &#39;s clothing was in the active process of having moisture osmosised away. Formerly dark spots regained their natural color. Almost as if sponged away. 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, yeah. That too! No towel. Just air dry.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) smiles, amused at the anger, and the pain from Shun&#39;Ichi. <font color = white>&#34;You two are good together.&#34;</font> It&#39;s funny.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled his clothes back on.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: ... why are you still so soggy?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: That confirms my suspicion, Hanako.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Now, he was interested.

He stood there, drenched, while she was already dry. This was clearly strange. Were his eyes playing tricks on him?

He raises a hand to pat her shoulder a few times, before he attempts to gently pinch her cheek...!

<font color = white>&#34;No way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Oh, right. Thanks for pulling me up, Guy!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: Hm...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...You indeed have a strange thing with water.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Try what?

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: YES?!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) snorted, and raised a hand to mask away her smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You Might Try!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Yes. You Hanako.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Isn't it?

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: His name is Might, Try, Hanako.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) scratched the back of his head. Well, at least that didn't escalate, he then turned to watch the amusing sight that was Hanako trying to figure out Try's name.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No, Hajame. It's 'Try.'
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I've been over this.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: HAJIME.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) spun so that he was sideways compared to Hanako and stepped forward, getting a little too close to be able to say he respect people's personal space.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The name's Might, Try! Oh yeah!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) had not entered the water for this very reason. She was wearing even more layers than most, because modesty was key to dignity.

While Hanako explained her own, in grusome detail. He decided to play along.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Hanako. Not Should Hanako. Or Could Hanaka. Possibly Hanako? No. Just Hanako. And not Just-Just Hanako. Only Hanako. But not &#39;Only&#39; Hanako. Hanako. The end.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (im going to pick out a house to say i live in)

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I hope chakra stuff is easy.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: The cold better hope it doesn't catch me.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Don't forget to train up those muscles. Something tells me that chubby kid will be back.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Round 2.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: ...Chakra is simple if you're gifted in it.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Chakra...?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: If not it can be a tad irritating.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) started beading with droplets. Sweat, probably. 
<font color = white>&#34;See you later!&#34;</font> She waved him off. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: I relate to that on a personal level.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Chakra is an energy Shinobi are trained in to use Ninjutsu, Genjutsu, as well as to enhance Taijutsu.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) wasn't that great at chakra control despite being an Uchiha.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The Uchiha are taught to mold it at a young age to make fire.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Curious, the same for the Senju-- well, with Suiton, not Katon.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hmm.. maybe one day, I'll use ninjutsu too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Katon, probably. Cats are cute.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wwould nod before demonstrating a small flame in-between his hands- Nothing too significant but enough to be seen.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: If you keep to your studies, then you wi--
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Katon is fire-related, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ka- as in.. fire.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Correct.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm good at language, I swear.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Okay!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Okay.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: What's everyone's dream??
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: My dream? Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Last night, I dreamed about swimming into a really deep place, and I found a whole mansion down there.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Easy- To keep non-nobles safe so that they aren't pulling more weight than they need to.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I suppose I would like to one day become the Hokage.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: There were glowing jellyfish serving as chandeliers.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: You sound like a deep sleeper, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: The curtains were made of kelp.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hmm.. you know the weirdest part of that dream?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: What's that?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I fell asleep in the bathtub.. and woke up under water.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Must've been only a second, but the dream felt long.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) thought about that as he crossed his arms. <font color = white>&#34;Well, that&#39;s a bit sudden... but for me.&#34;</font> He smiled confidently and used a thumb to point towards himself. <font color = white>&#34;I wanna become a Master at Taijutsu.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not really great at Katon... or Genjutsu... or chakra control at all.&#34;</font> It was a bit embarassing to admit that outloud. <font color = white>&#34;But I won&#39;t lose to others when it comes to my strength!&#34;</font> He closed his hand into a fist amd tapped it against his chest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Hanako, can you breathe underwater?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Huh? That would be weird. 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: You -are- weird.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm not a fish.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I can hold my breath for a long time though.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: Taijutsu, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Me too.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: How long?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I wanna make taijutsu that surpasses ninjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Uh.. I've never timed it. Like.. ten minutes?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ah, that's a rather good amount.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Ohhh! That's even greater than my dream! I should aim higher as well!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I get a little scared, so I've never tried any longer than that. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: What if I suddenly pass out?!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How do you even know when it'll happen?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: That's a long time Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Typically a case of your vision getting prickly, and your chest hurting. Followed by a sensation of fading away.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: You're like a dolphin.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh. Nope. Never felt that at all.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: A dolphin, huh..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) felt around her nape.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I don't have a blowhole.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: That's good.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Are you certain?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) gave a quizzical look towards his cousin, almost like he had to heads.

<font color = white>&#34;What about the family tradition..? Aren&#39;t you spooked of your parents being disappointed- I&#39;ve heard the stories of Uchiha that couldn&#39;t do their Right of Passage...&#34;</font> Kohaku was very obviously from a traditionalist Uchiha family, it showed here even more than his outfit.

Seems this was a glimpse of the Uchiha extreme high standards.

<font color = white>&#34;Then again if it ever came to that I&#39;d help you... just don&#39;t tell anyone, you know how they get if anything is less than perfect.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) lifts her ponytail out the way to let the Senju take a glimpse. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Nothing there.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. I think.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) raised a pointed finger to her chin in mild thought, her head cantering to the side.

<font color = white>&#34;Then my thesis is correct? You&#39;re part sponge indeed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I'm not spongy!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Some kind of clan skill I bet.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Ah, actually, I think I see it now.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I don't even have a family.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: A blowhole...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well you do now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) looked at Kohaku with an empty gaze as he laughed without any emotion, and then revealed to him. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m thirteen.&#34;</font> That meant he already went through the family tradition, completely failed that and was already a disappointment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I.. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Do I.. go see a doctor?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: What do I do?!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: You keep a steady diet of fish, and sea-jellies.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: But.. I don't like fish.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Pardon?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: They swim in their own pee. It's disgusting.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: But Hanako...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: So do you...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) frowned at the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) frowned back at Try.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I know..
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Their pee. Not your own.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Probably...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It only strengthens my hate for them-- thank you for clarifying.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Fish are exceedingly healthy food. They container many vital oils, and vitamins that make up the bulk of your daily intake.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Contain* guh)
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll stick to eating land-creatures.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: The sea is a little icky.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Deplorable. Unacceptable.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Why do you think the ocean gets so salty?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Fish. Doing their business in there! 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: For a gazillion years! 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's a wonder it's all still blue.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: The ocean is salty because of millions of years of sediment erosion of mineral deposits within it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) stares at the Senju like they've just spoken german. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Err. What?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Erosion? Minerals? 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) might as well have.

<font color = white>&#34;...Salty rocks have blended with the water over a very long time.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: But.. so has fish pee.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) dead panned towards his cousin... Oh no. He felt for Yuuto, he really did. Though he can&#39;t imagine that sort of outcast status, he had no words for a moment... only a long gaze of concern before nodding.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I see, living in the cold shoulder status... That&#39;s the worst, I&#39;d take up Taijutsu and Shurikenjutsu simply to stay away from the tension...

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll pass their expectations and make them regret it as you climb up the ranks in the name of the Uchiha.&#34;</font> In Kohaku&#39;s family there could be no failures, even a late bloomer could become a genius.

Even if they would absolutely do far more than ignore Kohaku if he failed his Right of Passage, he would be put through absolute hell. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: What happens to it? It just stays in the ocean! 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: It's typically eaten by micro orgaisms, presumably.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Organisms* the text is so tiny...)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) returned from the rest of the village with some newspapers in his hands. He passed them out.

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Same one, actually.. Maybe its a sign.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I see. I'm great with animals that aren't fish.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: This could be a good training opportunity.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: To search the village! To race a four-legged beast!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: .. to the trash can at the rib resturant!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: To catch the dog I must think like a dog.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Yes. What do dogs like?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Taijutsu!

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Me neither.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I keep birds, however.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I tried to keep a cat, but they always hiss at me when I try to pet them.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I don't know why.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) accepted the journal with a nod towards Might, Try, all while listening to Kohaku. It made his heart ache thinking about how his family viewed him, but that&#39;s okay. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s okay, don&#39;t worry about it.&#34;</font>

With a smile, he was back at full confidence as he gave pat to his cousin&#39;s shoulder. <font color = white>&#34;One day they&#39;ll appreciate me, even if only for my taijutsu, although I can&#39;t say I&#39;m just doing this to spite them and make them regret it.&#34;</font> He&#39;s doing it for himself as well.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, dogs don&#39;t climb but someone could&#39;ve gotten him there or maybe a large bird snatched him up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

But! Dogs, like most land creatures, enjoyed food. Meat especially. Of that, she is certain, from all those times she&#39;s witnessed strays going nuts over discarded karage. 

Along their travels, she found the trash can in question, right outside the local BBQ joint and--!

With a paper towel bearing hand, she procured some almost-cleaned rib bones, entirely overlooking any repulsed stares from her peers. She went about, waving the bone along, calling out in her sweetest animal-baby-talk tone.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Then again, I haven't tried to locate a dog before.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Hmmm... well, if you're better at sensing, do you want to take the lead Kurorama? If not, I'll grab some meat from the shop and try to go around with it.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Might as well. Running around in circles is for the dogs.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) That was it... he had climbed... launched people around, gotten crushed and then ran around the village. He was done, exhausted, and much like Hanako, he just plops down on a bar stool and raises a hand to make an order for the chef.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey chef, some barbecue meat, please... and water.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ramen Boss! One bowl of stock, please!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll have the double-udon with pork, a scoop of chicken, extra carrots, two bowls of fish cakes, and a slice of the day&#39;s pie, please.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly starts to roll around on the roof half asleep. It seems the smell of fresh food was starting make him unconciously hungry as drool slowly starts to slip out from his mouth saying.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gave a hearty laugh when hearing Hanako take the long way around to ordering a ramen. <font color = white>&#34;Y-yeah, he must&#39;ve had something in his eye.&#34;</font> He wipes a way a tear. Damn, these people he met today were just too much.

It would take a bit before his barbecue as finally served, and he even got a new weird guy sitting right beside him.  He would keep an eye on him in case he was one of those food thieves.

<font color = white>&#34;By the way, what did you all think of the first academy day? Wasn&#39;t like what I expected.&#34;</font> He thought it would be all about learning how to fight and putting it to practice.

Hearing the purple guy on the roof, he made another order. <font color = white>&#34;An udon as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninaest ninja-HoboCat) seemed far too healthy to be a food thief. Though with that on record, it also seemed as though the ninja was so far-removed from the idea of a food shortage that the kid's caution would go unquestioned. 

The odds of the two seeing one another as weird were high.

It gave her prime viewing vantage for watching the ol&#39; Ramen Boss slap together their respective orders. It hardly took long at all. Everything was ready to be tossed onto the grill, if not already boiling. Minutes later? They were presented with bowls and plated morsels. 

<font color = white>&#34;Mmm..? It was.. very hands on. And by hands on I mean, like.. hands on rocks. We touched a lot of rocks today. I&#39;m not a rock person! I&#39;ve never climbed a cliff. But. I think I did, like, pretty good--&#34;</font>

She settled in to eat her meal when she no doubts felt the dog mozy on up to the stall for a moment before absconding once more.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: We couldorder steak for this, it might work the best.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: The leftovers are appreciated.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) started picking up the barbecue, but not before downing the water cup he had asked for. He really wanted to catch that dog, anything that could put him ahead of Shishorama or the others. <font color = white>&#34;Not leftovers, I asked it for you. You&#39;re a loud sleeper.&#34;</font>

Anyhow, barbecue now in a box!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) selfishly took her bowl with her. She's slurping down the what she could while she waddles her way into the river. Yes. <b>Into</b> the river. She just straight up disappears down there. 

Bubbles float to the surface seconds later. An underwater groan when she realized her dastardly plot to have her own meal for herself backfired. It washed away, right out the bowl, with the current. Welp!

<i>Nothing more to do than wait.. the pets-- I mean capture will make up for this blunder.</i> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (y'know, i really half expected there to be no dog while we're around lol
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Brad(The sleepy purple one-Altro13) OOCs: (The dog was the friends we made along the way0
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I'll hide behind the tree.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: If it's hard to find it, try barking at it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) shifted in-between the buildings to hide away, still munching away on her fish cakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was very confused by what he saw Hanako doing... just going down into the river with her bowl of Ramen.

Anyhow! The box with barbecue was placed in the middle of the street. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll go hide on the roof of the restaurant.&#34;</font> He grabbed the Udon and climbed up there, handing it over to the sleepy purple guy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: Dogs can't help responding to barks.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Awoo.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: That's the spirit.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) sits behind the tree, surprised on how so far there is no sign of the Dog- He wondered how far the little guy wandered when they even left food for the pup.

Did the dog get that far already?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) socked a small-mouthed bass in the eye for getting too close to her. 
Nasty things. Minutes elapsed.

A need for air never arrived. Not like how the Senju described it. There was no pains in her chest. No stinging in her eyes. No signs of fatigue at all really. She felt nice and collected. Haze was the furthest thing from her mind. She's focused on the vague sensation of presences beyond the surface. So far--

<i>Just us. No dog.. huh. Maybe he'll come back when he feels enough time passed for us to leave? They probably have it down to a science, since he comes scavenging for food here often. He probably knows after people depart, that's the best time to find leftovers?</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly jumps down from the rooftop as he lands onto the ground making a small poof of dust before walking towards one of the stools as if nothing had happen. He would smile as he would grab a pair of chopsticks and begin slurping some Udon.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: Om nom nom.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) is starting to create a dislike for dogs.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Brad(The sleepy purple one-Altro13) OOCs: (i'm surprised there's an event so late at night)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (is it an event if we don't really know when it'll show up
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) wasn't so sure it even worked. Perhaps they'd missed their chance for the dog at this time, but at leasy she hadn't missed her lunch-- except for the slice of pumpkin pie currently plated on the table in the stand. She was eagerly waiting for the moment for the op to be called off so she could greedily consume it.

For she was no longer in possession of any fish cakes, they were all gone.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Brad(The sleepy purple one-Altro13) OOCs: (I nap)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (have a goodnight

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) jumped down and grabbed the box of barbecue. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, I give up for now, the dog will show up again sometime. Even if we don&#39;t catch it, I&#39;m sure someone else will.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I think I&#39;ll take a walk though, look around and then just go back home for the day.&#34;</font> With a nod, he looked at Kurorama and Hanako. <font color = white>&#34;What about you two?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) reacted to detecting movement towards the center of the road rather than the voices. She couldn&#39;t really hear much under the water. Her head poked out. 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh.. time to call it quits?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (a 5th senju
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) crawled out from her hiding spot, and peered to the bubbling water nearby. How long has she been under...? Could she scoop her slice of pie before anything happened, or was that irresponsible?

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve little to return him for at the moment.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) says: How do you utilize chakra? First to answer gets a prize.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: ... Uhm.... you... concentrate very hard,,, making energy flow through your body?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) is not good at that...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Though it isn't necessary for some techniques, the formation of handseals knead chakra into various natures-- the sequence creates the techniques.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: ...Is that sufficient, sir?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) turned his gaze from the three, almost dismissing them all, untill the gloomy one surprises him with a half answer. 

<font color = white>&#34;Half right Miss?. . .&#34;</font>

He paused to give her time to give her name, before continueing

<font color = white>&#34;Anyone else want to try and answer my pop quiz? How do you utilize chakra? First to answer completely gets a prize.&#34;</font>

He took note of the gloomy girl, weather she gave a name or not. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Kurorama, sir. Ah, forgive me if the answer wasn't sufficient.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) starts to think that getting embarassed over not understanding chakra control will become a common occurance in the future.

<font color = white>&#34;You gave the cloesest to the right answer.&#34;</font>

He nodded to the girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;Chakra is essential to even the most basic technique; it is the moulding of the physical energy present in every cell of the body and the spiritual energy gained from exercise and experience. Most shinobi utilize handsigns to utlize proper techniques and guide your chakra.&#34;</font>

He gave an impromptu lesson on the very very basics. 

<font color = white>&#34;Come here, Kurorama.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) reached into his jacket and pulled free a small wad of Ryo, and a ticket with a note. The note simply said One Question Answered. Then he&#39;d pass them over to the girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Captain Akitaru, A jounin of the village and leader of the twelve shinobi guardians. Take care of this. You can give it away, should you choose to do so, but I trust someone smart like you will understand it&#39;s value.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) accepted both!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) looked over to his side and then looked down at the smaller child who elbowed him. He&#39;d cock a brow before furrowing both of his brows. 

<font color = white>&#34;Is this the disrespect you show your hokage? To just elbow bump themwhen they are deep in thought?&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) turned to look towards the young girl casually make her way towards the lord Hokage and attempt to elbow bump him. A subtle shifting of himself and the single utilizeation of a handsign would place him betweem the pair in a flash of smoke, preventing her from doing so. 

<font color = white>&#34;Please show proper decorum when addressing and getting close to the lord hokage.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (ah, you beat me too it, I wasn't gonna let her actually touch you )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) parted with a gentle sigh, the girl just wasn&#39;t getting it...! A hand raised, pressing to her chest respectfully.

<font color = white>&#34;Please forgive her doofy nature, Captain Akitaru. She&#39;s not quite accustomed. As said my name is Kurorama, of the Senju. My goal is to become a valuable asset of the village-- a pillar that strives to keep the Will of Fire burning. And, one day, if I may be so bold, I would wish to hold office as the Hokage.&#34;</font>

Sssspeeeaaaking of, said Kage had just appeared. Oh no, this was quite the audience.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would side eye the senju as he wanted to stand inbtween the duo.The girl would burst into laughter.

<font color = white>&#34;Geesh I see you&#39;re going with the dull kage huh?Come on,I know you like to have a bit of fun.&#34;</font>they would nudgethe hokage once more again.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) Huh. Wait. Captain?! Oh-- This guy. This guy must be someone important. Whoops!

She straightened her posture and stood at attention-- wait. He was no longer standing here. He was.. down the road now?! Fast. Well, for now, she just continued standing stiff as a wooden plank, not saying a word! Observing the events play out. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) whispers: Hanako. Please listen to me. Those two-- the white-haired ones. They're the two most important people in the village.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) didn&#39;t even blink, as the girl attempted to once more touch the hokage, he moved swiftly, grabbing her by the shoulder and waist and, almost artisticly, tossing her over the wall into the water. His face remained impartial and stoic, never once betraying emotion. His voice was much the same as he spoke. 

<font color = white>&#34;You will not be warned a third time. Do not attempt to touch the lord Hokage without his express consent.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) nods eight times in the span of one second. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) whispers: Are.. we in trouble?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would sigh at the senju as they some how became the voice for the kage.

<font color = white>&#34;Since your hand is there mind giving me a rub?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) whispers: No, not us. But it's exceedingly important that we don't make any mistakes. It could potentially stall our careers.
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) whispers: ...As the girl is aptly demonstrating.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) showed a smirk as he turned to the two. 

<font color = white>&#34;Ah.. its okay, they are young afterall. Not many know the correct ways of decorum when addressing their superious. It will need to be taught in the academy.&#34;</font> The man slightly tilted his head back as his chin was raised, lowering his gaze onto the young Uchiha more. 

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me child, what is your name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) removed himself from the situation at that point, the lord Hokage now had this handled. His job had been completed in a manner approptiate his station. 

<font color = white>&#34;Of course, Lord Hokage&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) parted with a quiet &#39;Hemm&#39;, and tried to nudge the blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Introduce yourself.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would frown once seeing that the older senju didn&#39;t bless her with an awsome back rub.

<font color = white>&#34;My name is Senju Kumirama,pleasure to meet you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) had exactly zero refined etiquette skills. Naturally. She&#39;s has yet to even enter the Academy. Addressing individuals of note was beyond her limited skill range. But! She was able to follow helpful instructions, at the very least. 

A nudge and direction was just what she needed!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Hanako. I&#39;m, uh.. planning to join the Academy soon? Your.. <i>Captainship</i>?&#34;</font> She strained the last word together, having zero idea how to work with titles beyond what she&#39;s seen in novels about Lords. Surely that&#39;s how all titles worked, right? Lord equals Lordship! 

<font color = white>&#34;I, uh, look forward to learning!&#34;</font> She folds her hands at her waist and gauged their expression. Searching for any tells that she&#39;s scuffed up this introduction! </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcccc>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) nodded his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Interesting, I mistook you for an Uchiha. Your clans seem to have more and more similiar features with every passing generation. Noted. Senju Kumirama, ill be sure to have the Academy Sensei properly train you in your decorum.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d sigh as he looked up to the sky. <font color = white>&#34;Anyways,  I Should be off, the  hour is late and I am sure that we will have a very busy day tomorrow.&#34;</font> The Kaguya paused as he looked toward the older Senju. 

<font color = white>&#34;Captain, please be sure that this one specifically is made an example of infront of the class. I will not have soldier in Konoha&#39;s army that do not know proper decorum. Those who lack decorum, lack discpline, those who lack discpline do not follow orders, those who do not follow orders get their comrades killed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Koppun(The hokage-Taigodwushu) OOCs: (im checking out to rest. been at it for a long while now
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) regarded Hanako for a short while. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am the lead jounin of the village, and Commander of the twelve Guardians, Senju, Akitaru. You may Address me as Commander Senju or Akitaru Sensei, whichever you prefer.&#34;</font>

He nodded to the girl and the other senju standing beside her, giving them both a chance to say something in response. His head turned to bow towards the Hokage and nod. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll let the teachers know. Thank you for her oppertunity to learn, Lord Hokage.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Welp...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) skips away.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) gulped softly. Her mind had started to wander over what punishments await that one over there. The one skipping away. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll go with Commander Senju! Nice to meet you.&#34;</font>
It was the easiest to remember for someone who scores poorly in the realm of language. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (I might not be able to fully set myself up tonight, but I'll get as close as I can LOL )

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (2 extra core slots, Can Apply for a Unique as well as gain a jutsu from the inovator section )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (just feels more. . .IMpressive )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (plus some of the Senju tree for wood kinda booty )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Well it's 1 more core slot than the other path.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (a bunch of the coded Wood style don't even gain benefit from the last last perk in the wood tree )

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (what's your discord? )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Do we at least get the cool dragon? MakeshiftWalrus.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (It's not coded atm )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (but I'm sure we do )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) nods his head cooly, looking over at Kurorama. 

<font color = white>&#34;And you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Oh no, I know how that works, it'll take months for anything to get added...)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Er-- which title I'll address you by, sir?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) asks: I think you'll decided that, wont you?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) didn't let his emotion show this was a test.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) dismissed the notion of family entirely-- in her mind, she hadn&#39;t yet earned the right to address him with familial tone.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes, Commander Senju.&#34;</font>

Not that she usually went first name-basis with people she just met to begin with.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s an honour to finally make acquaintance with you. If you intend to teach at the academy, I&#39;d hope for your guidance.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) let only the slightest hint of a smile creep through upon his face, before it vanished. It was only for a blink, it might even be possiable that she&#39;d missed it, but a single nod of his head is given. 

<font color = white>&#34;I see. I don&#39;t plan to teach, I have other tasks I&#39;ll be handleing, but, if you run into a question you need answered?&#34;</font>

He patted his own chest, indicateing the pocket she had slipped her prize into. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) quietly excused herself, as to not disturb their conversation!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [time for me to go prepare for bed]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [nightynite]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Sleep well. I'm not long for this world either.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) dipped into a gentle bow at that! It only lasted as long as she spoke, though.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be sure to spend it wisely. I&#39;m certain there are things that only a Senju can assist with.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) says: Indeed. . .I'll be watching you very carefully moveing forward. 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) says: Do not bring shame to our clan as young Kumirama has. 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) says: Make sure the village see's the noble truth of the Senju. 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Of course. I'll strive not to make a fool of our name, Commander Senju.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: For the time being, might I retire? It's been a rather long day.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) says: You are free to do so. 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) says: I have high hopes for you, Kurorama. 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) says: Dismissed.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Then, I wish you a pleasant night. Until next time.
