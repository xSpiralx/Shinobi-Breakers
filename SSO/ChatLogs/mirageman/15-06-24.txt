<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) narrows his eyes on Sogeki and the dancer from afar. He hadn't taken him for the type to ask for mentorship. In what he'd briefly seen of him he seemed closer to a brute of some kind. His head slowly tilts to the side as his eyes trail along the woman's movements.

In one swift motion she watches the woman attempt to throw them into the waters and in this he looks toward the newcomer on his right.

Blinking a few times he noticed he was mid air. Spiraling about like a ball thrown in the air. Not a single clue as to how he even got up here. <font color = white>&#34;Sheesh.

<font color = white>&#34;Wait wait wait... What...?&#34;</font>

He would raise his hands up and push away anything she would try to offer him.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you think I&#39;m a begger...?&#34;</font>

He looked himself over for a minute, he looked fine as far as he saw, his hair was just a bit messy, not dirty.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s focus remained unwavering amidst the chaos that often swirled around him. While his classmates indulged in various extracurricular activities, he remained singularly dedicated to forging a path towards a stronger future. The petty distractions of others held no sway over his ambitions or principles.

His determination to establish a solid foundation for himself was palpable, driving him to hone his skills relentlessly. Whether in combat training or mastering advanced techniques, Sogeki pushed himself with unwavering discipline. The fleeting pursuits and diversions of his peers were inconsequential in his pursuit of mastery and excellence.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me,&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the ambient noise, his tone laced with arrogance and confidence as he turned to the dark-skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;How does one earn the honor of becoming your first and most important pupil?&#34;</font> His gaze locked onto hers, challenging and expectant, as if daring her to recognize his potential and skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) rubs the nape of his neck and looks off over to the comotion to his left. His posture was one of faint exhuasion.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;N-no... It&#39;s just my hairstyle and I like it... I don&#39;t need a haircut.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d proceed to raise his hands up to cover his head and protect his hair from the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Mugen, Yurei (The long-haired boy-Mirageman) kept his hands to his side and then looked over with a light smile to those of his right. His long tied hair swayed in the soft undiffused evening breeze.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had returned to her place, and stood there once more with her hands nestled behind her back. A poised stance, one of experience past her years, and it honestly showed. 

She didn&#39;t even make notice of the young lad drowning - he would learn to swim, or he would sink. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? My methods are harsh, brutal, and often end the lives of those wishing to learn to become like me if they survive? Often more then not they are crippled. Train, and show me that you can survive - then we can see,&#34;</font>

She answered simply.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) When the soft spoken lass leaped in to the water, they&#39;d see the white-haired boy with his legs and arms crossed relaxing in the water. As if taking a break before decided to resurface.

A wave given and then <font color = white>&#34;..hllphb.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say as air bubbles escaped his mouth when speaking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do not baby Genin, I am not here to coddle you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) 
As Daigen left the tranquil training area and walked towards the busier parts of Amegakure, he soon found himself in a crowded marketplace. The vibrant energy of the village was palpable, with merchants calling out their wares, villagers chatting animatedly, and children running about. The contrast to the solitude of his training ground was stark, but Daigen moved through the crowd with ease, his senses alert and focused.

His attention was drawn to a dark-skinned woman standing in the center of the bustling crowd. She had an air of confidence and charisma that seemed to captivate those around her. The crowd’s attention was firmly fixed on her, and she spoke with a commanding presence that demanded respect.

Daigen didn't approach her directly. Instead, he found a spot nearby where he could observe without drawing too much attention to himself. Leaning against a wall, he watched as the woman engaged with the people around her. She spoke passionately about something, her gestures animated and expressive. 

He tried to discern what she was saying from a distance. Her voice, though clear, was drowned out by the general noise of the market. However, her body language and the reactions of the crowd spoke volumes. She appeared to be a figure of some importance or influence, and the villagers seemed to hang on her every word.

Daigen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he observed. He noted the way she commanded the space around her, the way people leaned in to listen, the respect evident in their expressions. There was something about her that intrigued him, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. 

His thoughts wandered as he considered the possibilities. Who was this woman? What role did she play in the village? Was she a shinobi, a leader, or perhaps someone with a different kind of influence? 

For now, Daigen chose to remain an observer. He knew that understanding the people around him, especially those who commanded such attention, could be crucial. He continued to watch, taking in every detail, from her expressions to her interactions with the crowd.

Though he didn’t make a move to approach her, Daigen stored away this moment in his mind. One day, it might prove useful to know more about the influential figures within his village. For now, he would remain in the background, learning what he could from the shadows.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) shook his head silently as he turned toward the ongoing conversation between who he'd assumed to be the instructor and his peers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Then again.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) blinked again slolwy, at this point he was beginning to get self conscious about his hair, was it really that bad?

<font color = white>&#34;No... I love my family. What&#39;s wrong with my hair? I think it looks cool, I go out every day looking like this.&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t know how to deal with this, he had never experienced this sort of interaction before.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do believe I have to teach some method of fundamental Taijutsu and Kenjutsu.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) gave the white-haired boy a dumbfounded look, before pouting as she&#39;d fold her arms.
The boy was likely a Hozuki, Shinobi of Water.
<font color = white>&#34;Well crud...&#34;</font> She&#39;d think, seeing how her help wasn&#39;t even neccessary.

Then, the realization set in further, and she couldn&#39;t help but smile at the boy, waving back at him before pointing up, as she decides it was best to leave the boy in his &#39;area of expertise&#39;, and to have some fresh air, herself, climbing out of the water, soaking wet, afterwards.</font></font></font>

He noticed the way she spoke and took notes, understanding her building a strong rapport with each individual.
The boy picked up on a few key details, noticing how the woman often spoke about improvements and benefits for the village. It became cleaer that she was a local leader.
Satisfied with the information he had gathered, Daigen leaned back against a railing and took a deep breath while analyzing and channeling the information he had received.

To me though she may seem like an entertainer of sorts - However, she did fling a person into the water.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s gaze sharpened with a flicker of anger that simmered beneath his confident exterior, fueling his desire to surpass not only others but himself as well. The dark-skinned dancer&#39;s blunt assessment of her training methods, harsh and unforgiving, resonated with him on a primal level.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm,&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted, his voice edged with the simmering anger that churned within him. He acknowledged the truth in her words, knowing that talent alone would not suffice in the brutal world of shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;Harsh, brutal, and often crippling,&#34;</font> he repeated, his tone now laced with a fierce determination rather than excitement. <font color = white>&#34;I understand.&#34;</font>

His eyes bore into hers with a steely resolve. <font color = white>&#34;I have talent, but I know I must work harder than anyone else to get ahead and stay ahead,&#34;</font> he declared firmly. The acknowledgment of his own potential was coupled with a relentless drive to prove himself worthy of her instruction, to push beyond his limits and emerge stronger, regardless of the challenges ahead.

<font color = white>&#34;I accept your terms,&#34;</font> Sogeki affirmed, his voice ringing with the conviction born of both anger and ambition. <font color = white>&#34;Train me. I&#39;ll show you what I&#39;m capable of.&#34;</font> His declaration hung in the air, a silent vow to himself and a challenge to the dancer who had dared him to prove himself worthy. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: And... Seeing as someone practically begs her to train them, she's likely Chuunin or higher?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ..what did that scrub just say..!? Begging? Tch.. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) continued to stand her ground; her hands never unfurling or leaving her back while she listened. She sighed briefly, and slowly motioned to ease a hand from the curling behind her back. 

She rubbed her chin slowly; her skin untouched - almost flawless in nature despite her information regarding her training regiment. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Earn it, over the next few weeks I&#39;ll be watching all of you - and I have plans to...educate you all in some manner or another. I have various little tests set up for all of you to curve the impending death many of you will walk into,&#34;</font>

She chuckled slowly. Her hand eased back, and curled back within the other once more. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t die or get killed, we can talk after that,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: My name is Torizuka, Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: A pleasure to make your acquaintance, of sorts, miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: My name is Hanamura.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: When give a full name, respond in kind.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I ... Am afraid I do not have a surname.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Nor a clan...
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A clan does not make one stronger then another.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would make his way over to a dark skinned kid</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That I agree with.
<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) Daigen nodded intently as the woman spoke about the village leader&#39;s strength and her emphasis on Taijutsu. His eyes flickered back to the incident by the water, confirming the impressive display of power. Taijutsu seemed like a practical choice for someone aspiring to be a strong shinobi.

Turning to Hanamura, he appreciated her insights and wanted to learn more about her specialization.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your specialty, Hanamura?&#34;</font> Daigen asked, curious about her skills and experiences.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Did I miss something?
<br><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (...I could buy Blinding Seals, and be cheeky.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) turned her head to face Daigen a moment, before looking back towards Botan.
<font color = white>&#34;I doubt she is an actual leader, a high-ranked official perhaps. But I do not think she&#39;s a leader. No offense.&#34;</font>

She then lowers her head.
<font color = white>&#34;As for my specialty? I&#39;m a student. I have ... Ideas... And dreams and goals, but currently I need practice. Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, I suppose, if that&#39;s an &#39;OK&#39; answer?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) continued to stare forward as Sogeki&#39;s resolve seemed to flicker alight under the harsh layout of the higher-up&#39;s training methods. With each time the boy opened his mouth he seemed to break the otherwise hard exterior his present in hopes of being able to receive direct tutillage from the woman.

 <i><font color = white>&#34;?&#34;</font></i> - His expression was one that questioned why? Or at least, that&#39;s one would&#39;ve been right to assume from it.

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A Leader? No, I'm a Chuunin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) gaze shifted to the older dark-skinned woman with a raised brow, not having expected the village to be led by a woman.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) nods.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand. Ninjutsu and Taijutsu are great aspirations.&#34;</font>

He turns to Botan.

<font color = white>&#34;You would not consider yourself a leader, Botan chan?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Its Ms.Botan.. she's kinda famous.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: No, the others may lead. I am simply here to ensure you all have the tools needed to survive.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: And to ensure the survival of Amegakure.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Ah tools. Do you happen to have shuriken on you?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Weapons of any sort.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: and it seems I must educate you on proper words.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I am always ready to learn on anything.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: *about*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) notice that even more children were present than before. As he stood besidfe the light post, he watch from a distance as the aggressive one engaged in a conversation below. His eyes wouldn&#39;t drift at the sound of a mature voice off to the side, however he did note that the word <font color = white>&#34;Chuunin&#34;</font> had been mentioned. 

Surely in time he&#39;d cross path wirth the chuunin one way or another. As for now his thoughts were occupied with the conversation occuring south of his present position. 

<font color = white>&#34;Sogek, everything alright over there?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: A grammer lesson so early in the day. Seems this Miss Botan ain't playing around.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: On that note for those that missed it, any damage done to the village will be inflicted upon you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) creeps behind the pillar of the nearby building ever so slightly, making sure half her body is obscured in its darkness.

<font color = white>&#34;Master Matsu mentioned her once as well, so-- Eh?? Why would we damage our own home?&#34;</font> She sneered from behind the pillar.

Her pale eyes peeking at each individual around, not missing even the slightest movements.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (hm, that perk didn't raise my str.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) was still drenched, that combined with her previous help-attempted being unnecessary, did dampen her mood a bit.
But she&#39;d smile again, even as the lady Botan seemed to be &#39;frightening&#39; in a sense.

<font color = white>&#34;It was an honor and pleasure meeting you, though, lady Botan. I apologise for not knowing too much about you, if anything at all, before seeing you here.&#34;</font>

The girl shook her head before making a few steps sotuhwards.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d better get changed into dry clothing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Southwards*)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) ears would perk up at the warning issued by the dark skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;Excuse me is that a new decree? I&#39;m not sure that I head any word of this from the morning broadcast&#34;</font> he asked while rotating his attention of to the side. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded. 

   <font color = white>&#34;People often don&#39;t take care of the things that take care of them,&#34;</font>

She replied to the pearl-lass, then she turned towards Hanamura and nodded before she began to speak once more. 

   <font color = white>&#34;No need for apologizes,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A personal rule really.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Well thats a shame, thats not how my family raises my siblings and I.

<font color = white>&#34;She tried to help you out of the water. Why are you still in there?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (I am not.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s frustration simmered as he found a quiet corner away from the bustling activity of the academy courtyard. With a determined exhale, he settled himself on the ground and closed his eyes, entering a deep meditative state. The chaotic noise of his surroundings faded into the background as he focused inward, channeling his anger and determination into a disciplined mental state.

His breathing slowed, becoming steady and controlled. The tension in his muscles gradually eased as he immersed himself in the tranquility of meditation. Images of his goals and aspirations flickered behind closed eyelids, driving him to push harder, to prove himself beyond any doubt.

As he meditated, the memory of the encounter with the dark-skinned dancer lingered in his mind. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll show you who the beggar is soon enough, NERD!&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s thoughts seethed with indignation and determination. His mind replayed the scene, the challenge laid before him, and the promise of harsh training that awaited if he could prove himself.

Each insult and dismissive remark echoed faintly in his thoughts, propelling him to show his true strength and worth. Amidst the stillness, Sogeki resolved to surpass expectations, to transform his frustration into a force that would propel him forward. The ground beneath him seemed to solidify as he embraced the peace of meditation, preparing himself mentally for the rigorous journey ahead.</font></font></font>

If so my I be bold enough to ask for your name?&#34;</font> he waited attentively for a response as he Sogeki paced around. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: He's determined like me.

They said, believing they pronounced the name correctly.
<font color = white>&#34;Do you know when the academy will officially open? I don&#39;t wish to miss orientation.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Then as everyone else continued their introductions she&#39;d recall, <font color = white>&#34;From the Hyuuga clan, of course.&#34;</font> As if it was not obvious enough by the girls pearl white eyes.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I would like to see a fight, Sogeki.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ...?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I'm always training.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ..pfffft. Get outta here, Daigen! You know nothing of TRUE training.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Hm, perhaps I don't. Will you teach me?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Bahahah!-
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: ..eh?

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: You could make it interesting.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Mugen, Yurei (The long-haired boy-Mirageman) crosses his arms with a light smile, thin eyes narrowing on the community.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: A spar sounds like fun
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Ooh, A spar.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: The loser does twenty laps wearing weights.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Or perhaps I can locate a boulder.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s boastful laughter abruptly ceased when Daigen unexpectedly requested his aid. Caught off guard, Sogeki&#39;s left eyebrow quirked in surprise, and he fell into a deafening silence. He scrutinized Daigen for a solid minute, weighing the request and considering the implications.

Finally, Sogeki shrugged nonchalantly and extended his arm towards Daigen. <font color = white>&#34;If we train together, that makes us one step closer to being brothers. You understand that, right?&#34;</font> His tone was serious yet tinged with a hint of camaraderie. <font color = white>&#34;Only thing left is a nice cup of sake to seal the deal.&#34;</font>

With that, Sogeki presented Daigen with a fist bump, a gesture of solidarity and acceptance of the partnership Daigen had proposed. It was a rare moment of openness from Sogeki, acknowledging the potential bond that could be forged through shared training and mutual respect.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) squints.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) attention shifted onto Daigen-san before asking, <font color = white>&#34;Is there a designated ground for all spars to be conducted in the village?&#34;</font> 

Crossing his arms as he stood beside his new friend, the child would wait for a response. Hopefully it was a location with seating.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: It smells of lowborn.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) approached the aggressive boy who talked about sparing.

They suggested looking at the aggressive one and their companion.</font></font></font>
