<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) moves the offered streamer to show it to the trickster. Using his other hand to scratch at the back of his head as he nervously laughs.

<font color = white>&#34;Haha... yeah... Least I got a streamer off Yurei though!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) yells: Good job!

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: A target to aim for...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.
(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)

<font color = white>&#34;Hello there! It&#39;s great to meet you!&#34;</font> she said brightly, her eyes sparkling excitedly. <font color = white>&#34;Are you here for the fun with the streamers too?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) A quick inspection of his person confirmed that he was. 

A pair of Streamers remain untouched, hanging from his belt. Meanwhile. He&#39;s got the torn remains of someone else&#39;s looped around his wrist like a makeshift bracelet. A trophy from his last bout. 

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s right. Who might you be?&#34;</font>
He&#39;s got a casual air about him, despite lying in wait for someone.
Only a minor beading of sweat lingers on his brow. Far from exhausted. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I am Katora. Of the Fūma Clan.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Forgive me. I never caught your name, though I'm sure I've seen you before.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I am Kohana. My surname is Hoshino. It is nice to meet you as well. It seems you have been busy already.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Anyway. I would like to challenge you, win or lose for the streamers..
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I accept. Naturally. Show me what you can do, Kohana.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: Great! Let me get in position!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a short, muffled single laugh.
<font color = white>&#34;If you win? I&#39;ll permit you to shorten my name to Kat.&#34;</font>

After which, he offered the universal gesture for &#39;Bring it on.&#39; </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana approached Katora with enthusiasm, though she maintained an air of caution. He seemed well-versed in the streamer game. As she neared him, she couldn&#39;t resist a bit of playful banter.

<font color = white>&#34;Kat and Koh, huh? Kat definitely has a better ring to it,&#34;</font> she said with a smile, her eyes twinkling with a mix of curiosity and amusement.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) maintained his hawkish stare on them. Even with their approach being so straightforward, he was not one to underestimate an opponent. They were similar in that regard, it appears, given their careful approach. 

<font color = white>&#34;I won&#39;t deny that. Hana may serve you better. Are you skilled at Taijutsu, Hana?&#34;</font>

Lazy and slow, he took a step forward, and lifts his palms into a mid-guard defense. Riddled with openings for attack. </font></font></font>
