<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana maintained her calm demeanor, her lavender eyes narrowing slightly as she observed Katora&#39;s seemingly lazy stance. His mid-guard defense, riddled with openings, screamed of a trap. She took a deep breath.

<font color = white>&#34;Not much, but I try,&#34;</font> she responded, her voice steady.

With a swift, deliberate movement, Kohana feinted to the left, then quickly adjusted. Seeing an opportunity, she closed the distance and aimed a sharp punch at his lower torso.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) briefly flit his attention to the Darkly Dressed someone by the hall.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh? A Raven&#39;s come along. To pick off what scraps remain, no doubt-- and they&#39;re gone.&#34;</font>

It seems they weren&#39;t interested in sticking around. So. Those Keen Eyes refocus on Hana, a bit grateful  to not have to deal with a potential post-match ambush. Pacing one&#39;s self was key to success in a free for all. 

<font color = white>&#34;Fair answer.&#34;</font>

In a beat, they&#39;ve closed the distance, though his pupils scroll across her jukes and feints as if he were text on a document. Far too sharp to fall for even well-executed fake outs. Her footwork was too non-committal to suggest she was truly going left, and they were pointed directly his way, with heels ready to spring into action.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d say the same.&#34;</font>

He swiveled and steps into their guard, having their fist merely brush into the fabric of his attire. It finds purchase with neither his ribbons or his frame. In turn, he slices the edge of his hand for their waist, intent on hacking through their ribbon dancing in the wind. 

<font color = white>&#34;I only have sharp reflexes to carry me.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana&#39;s eyes widened slightly as Katora swiftly closed the distance, effortlessly reading her feints. His sharp reflexes were evident as he dodged her punch with ease.

Seeing his hand slice toward her waist, she quickly reacted. Twisting her body, she turned the streamers away from him as best she could, shifting her feet to maintain balance.

<font color = white>&#34;Impressive reflexes indeed,&#34;</font> she acknowledged, her voice steady but edged with a hint of respect.

Counter. Kohana steps forward, close to him...Probably too close. Both arms reach out in an attempt to grapple with him.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) spots another one just that quickly. Even through the turbulence of combat&#39;s flow.
<font color = white>&#34;Another Raven here to scavenge. Huh,&#34;</font> he murmured. 

Meanwhile, his chop finds nothing but air. They&#39;ve dodged his retaliation. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hardly. I&#39;ve got a long way to go. We all do. But, to your credit...&#34;</font> 

Huh. They&#39;ve spread their metaphorical wings and encroached upon him. A grappling maneuver? A submission hold? No matter. It was far too telegraphed. Untying it just as one would a knot, he let them get close, only to suddenly lunge up and over them as if they were a vaulting horse. 

A hand harmlessly used their crown as support while he leapfrogged their minor height, only to touch the floorboards, duck and spin, slicing his heel for their legs. A sweep-kick. 

<font color = white>&#34;... you&#39;re doing better than the last one.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana watched Katora deftly avoid her grapple, using her own momentum against her. His agility was impressive, but she wasn&#39;t about to let herself be outmaneuvered so easily. She quickly leaped back as he landed, narrowly avoiding the sweep.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve got sharp eyes, Katora,&#34;</font> she remarked, a hint of a smile on her lips despite the situation. 

<font color = white>&#34;But vultures are more fitting for scavengers. Ravens, on the other hand, are a bit more resourceful.&#34;</font>

She steadied herself, keeping her guard up and eyes sharp. A quick reach was made for his waist.

They&#39;re quick to return to him, pacing themselves, steadily making their way until..!
Indistinguishable from a cobra&#39;s bite, they went for it, seeking to bite fingers into his Streamer. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong. But. Calling someone a Raven is a bit more respectful. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</font>

Casual chatter made as he made like a Karate Kid and Wax Off&#39;d. Almost like a window washer&#39;s lateral wipe, he chops the edge of his hand into their wrist to divert the trajectory of their grab, leaving those fingers to take hold of nothing but air.

In kind, he steps into their guard and snatched for that dancing streamer of theirs, while she&#39;s yet to lean away from her recent assault.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana&#39;s eyes widened slightly as Katora skillfully deflected her grab, his hand chopping her wrist aside with practiced ease. He was undeniably quick, but she couldn&#39;t afford to lose focus now.

<font color = white>&#34;You have a point,&#34;</font> she replied, her voice calm despite the intense exchange. <font color = white>&#34;Ravens do have a certain grace to them.&#34;</font>

Feeling his hand snatch at her streamer, she twisted her body, but this time, he managed to secure it firmly. She felt the fabric slip from her grasp, and she couldn&#39;t help but smile.

<font color = white>&#34;But even graceful creatures can fight fiercely when they need to.&#34;</font>
Seeing that Katora had her, Kohana relaxed her stance and chuckled softly. She reached onto her waist and handed him the other streamer, bowing her head slightly in respect.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve bested me this time, Katora. I&#39;ve learned a lot from you and what I need to work on,&#34;</font> she said, her tone genuinely appreciative.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;It appears... no matter who wins between the two of us. We&#39;re due to be ambushed by that very Raven--&#34;</font>

Oh. After he&#39;s managed to tear off one of their Ribbons, well, they&#39;ve lost the fire, the friendly hostilities, and decided to grant him their last remaining Streamer.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh. You already noticed.&#34;</font>
If it&#39;s to be presumed that this was not a trick, well, he calmly reached on over to take the gift.

<font color = white>&#34;Likewise. I look forward to seeing what you will make of what you learned.&#34;</font> 
In kind, he tips his head into a slight, yet respectful bow. 

Those Fresh Stolen Ribbons join the two already tied around his wrist like Trophies, leaving him with a grand total of four taken.

His own remain untouched.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Mysterious Stranger (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) rests with his hands and arms very nearly exposed, as shinobi begin to appear to the gate his eyes don’t narrow. His gaze does avert to them however.

His hands clearly rest upon two swords - one of which be a samurai sword and another which lie on a regular katana. A voice that sounds mechanical yet fluid seems to speak out, sounding more high pitched than expected. And like it had gears turning behind to make the voice.

<font color = white>&#34;This is...home now...&#34;</font> He whispers under his breath, looking amongst the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Hear ye, Iwagakure!</b></i>I’m an envoy of the Dakuteika - sent with a warning.&#34;</font>

He stops to see who amongst them would be the lead for the message. But since the other one that got sent to Amegakure never returned, he was heavily armed.A step backwards with a motion forward, for whoever would see themselves the leader amongst them to step forward and take a look behind him at the ten bloodlied headbands.

<font color = white>&#34;These belonged to some of your own, younger...<i>ones</i>, I believe. Much like those among your crowd. This is what happens to you out in the wilderness. You leave your village, and you enter <b><i>our</b></i> territory&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Sakujak, Ryohei (The short-tempered youth-Kwaj874) kept his gaze trained upon the man situated at their front door, his arms folded over his chest. With his eyesight, he&#39;s able to pick up on the man&#39;s items from afar.

Two swords, and a bunch of bloodied headbands of the fallen. It causes his expression to sour. The message was heard loud and clear-- an obvious threat.

<font color = white>&#34;Those headbands...&#34;</font> he says, kicking off of the wall to land down below. He commits the man&#39;s face to memory, not crazy enough to pick a fight without tools of his own.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana listened intently as the mechanical voice filled the air, her heart pounding with fear and determination. She observed the envoy steadily, taking in every word and detail. Her eyes briefly flickered to the bloodied headbands, a surge of sorrow, but she remained silent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) wasn&#39;t quite sure what was going on so for the most part she intended to remain quiet and observant, seeing as a Chuunin was called, this certainly wasn&#39;t her place to step forward or engage in any fashion. Being as short as she was, it was a bit tough to see through the crowd so she stepped forward somewhat to get a better look of things.

It was declared that some of the headbands belonged to their own. She cut a sharp gaze toward the &#39;messenger&#39;. Though unknown to her, she was visibly irritated that people from her home had been cut down. Someday her and her friends would be out there.

<font color = white>&#34;Tch...&#34;</font> still she remained quiet.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) arrives later than intended due to some difficulties. He stares at the man who arrived, at the bloodied headbands, and at the reactions of all those around him.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) lip curled, she was in no place to speak on such matters but she could not help but say something loud enough for her peers to hear. 

<font color = white>&#34;There is only one of them.&#34;</font> She pointed out and looked at the back of the older Shinobi. Would such an offense be let to pass? They had the bodies....but she was one of those bodies herself....</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) looked at sensei as soon as the headbands.<font color = white>&#34;So we are next? I hope not. But you got it.&#34;</font>The teenager seemed too calm and not stressing over the situation. He had full hope in his sensei to beat this guy to death. Taking out his book he would sit down and turn a page. He then noticed Shuye arrived and waved.<font color = white>&#34;Oh hey Shuye you came to the party or warning of this guy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Calmness remained with him throughout the stiff warning.

A Swordsman Messenger declared those he represented an enemy of their entire village. The foremost thought on his mind, reflected from a statement like that, could only be...

<font color = white>&#34;Their days are numbered.&#34;</font>
A soft, muffled murmur, beyond earshot.

More importantly, he&#39;s eager to see whether their superiors might shoot this messenger, who arrived here bearing the highest of hostilities. It was only karma. Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka)  From a squatting position, the girl would begin slapping the ground with three hands to voice her disgust for this kind of attitude!  This was sounding much like a threat, as if he was bragging about killing their genin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ayyo!  How brave!  Killing genin younger than yerself, must feel nice, ye?  Then coming to our gates?  Bragging?  threatening?  Ay ay ay ay.   Message recieved.&#34;</font>

Yeah, this Tsuchigumo girl was pissed, she was ready for a fight!  BRING IT!  Though as for making decisions or actions?  That&#39;s left to Bathroom Sensei.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) couldn't really see the bloody headbands because; his eye sight was awful, and because there were a bunch of people in the way. So the weight of the man's threatening speech didn't really land with the generally dumb boy.

But he did at least still understand it was a threat. It sounded like people had been caught by... bandits? Probably bandits. Outside the walls or something similar. A mostly uneeded warning for Hideo as he had no desire to go beyond the walls to begin with.

The guy had a bunch of swords, for example. What did he have? A cool rock he found on the way here and some loose change. It would take a long while before he was confident and geared enough to much further than he was right now. But he would go that far eventually.

Someone had to avenge who ever the messenger had, probably, killed.</font></font></font>

As if he were filled with churning devices, and maybe even a static charge that slightly irradiated from him somehow.

To those with ever keen sight, his body had very clear grooves but not like the carving of wood into puppetry - it was more refined and held smoother parts.

He glances towards the ground for but a moment, as if stepping carefully for some odd reason. With those having their eagle-like sight though? The area was littered with hundreds upon hundreds of explosive tags - all the way to the gate

With that said...
     ...if they moved to attack or secure that retreating fellow, well, he was ready to assist in whatever inconsequential way he could. A pair of kunai found their way to his hands.

Hana continued to listen to the commanding man, her attention unwavering despite the discomfort gnawing at her. The mechanical timbre of his voice grated against her ears, and the sudden switch to a childlike tone sent a shiver down her spine, amplifying the unease she felt. Every word he spoke heightened the tension, making the entire situation increasingly unsettling for her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: Ehh?

<font color = white>&#34;Surely as Shinobi.....there is a manner in which we could chase such a being?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) brought her knuckles to her chin as she observed quietly. Shuye's talents were lacking in this department. She was not particularly observant; she didn't have the uncanny ability to sense the energy in things her brother had, either. Worse, she was barely a genin, physically. No, explosive ordnance disposal was far beyond her capabilities.

She wouldn't have spotted them without another shinobi calling it out.

A traitor to the village, daring to come to the front gates...?

Was Iwagakure so weak?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) approached the scene, her eyes scanning over the crowd carefully before noticing someone outside of the gate-- Of course there was.

A sigh escaped her as she leapt overtop of the students, landing next to Chocho. Turning to face her for a moment, a smile is flashed, followed by a peace sign. She then finally turns her attention onto the stranger at their gates.
 <font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, she called out, looking him over from head to toe.

The camera in his eye was instantly spotted, alerting her to put her guard up. Perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps someone was actually coming to spy on them. Either way, it was work she didn&#39;t plan on having to deal with.
 <font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re just dropping stuff off, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font>, she began, her eyes looming over to the field behind him, noting the vast amount of explosive tags that were placed.

 <font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;know.. Someone has to clean those up, and it isn&#39;t gonna be me!&#34;</font>, she protested, venting another sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever.. If there&#39;s nothing else, then be on your way so I can find someone else to paw- I mean.. Delegate.. This task to...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: For ryo....
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: If it means more ryo that means.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Please step back for the time being.

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Would it not trigger a cascade...  A chain reaction of explosions?  Possibly taking out the cliff, gate and part of the wall or nore?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (more*

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: It ain't science.  It's fact that if a tag explodes close enough to another, it'll trigger it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was susceptible to the explosions that had gone off unless he was saved by an awesome pair of shinobi. He covers his face, preparing for the worst.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) was probably safe, way up there on the village wall. 
Merely lifting a hand to shield his eyes from the brief blinding light that came with the detonation.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) The explosion erupted suddenly, sending debris and a powerful shockwave. Kohana was tossed to the side, hitting the ground hard and feeling the impact through her body.

As she lay there, trying to catch her breath, doubts began to creep into her mind. Was she really built for this shinobi life?

Unless saved by the Chunin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would of course!...try her best to...block all the explosions!...by explanding her body and body blocking the exterance of the gaze!

She was now...super big...one arm went to the one arm went to the right. It was more to stop the shockwave from reaching them...taking on all of the force!

HOwever...as the smoke settled..she noticed that the commanding man was gone...high into the wind...maybe feelings..unfounded..mm..un found....she then waved her hand to clear the smoke residue...as she watched their now broken stair case...probably covered in crystals...

[Aimed to protect those closest and behind her with multisize body block!]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) vents a <i>massive</i> sigh as the explosive tags begin to detonate outwards in. Perhaps it was time for her to actually take this situation seriously.

 <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s like.. The uncoolest thing you could&#39;ve done, random dude.&#34;</font>, she protested. Her hands came together, weaving through a flurry of seals.

With a clap of her hands, the Shingen musters all of her Chakra into the air above the tags. <font color = white>&#34;Doton: Otoshibuta!&#34;</font>

From out of thin air, a massive lid forms, hovering over the field in front of the group. The surrounding area was of no concern to her, the wall was far too sturdy for any amount of explosive tags to take it down.. To an extent.

The shadow that loomed over all present only lingered for a moment before beginning to shrink at a rapid rate. Anyone who&#39;d not yet realized a giant lid spawned in the air would quickly notice as it began crashing down towards the ground, sealing in the impending explosion.
 <font color = white>&#34;Man.. One of these days I&#39;m gonna need to get paid more... This is getting ridiculous..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mysterious Stranger(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: Cya soon Iwa)

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I'm still deciding on you lot, but that guy definitely didn't pass.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: What is a vibe?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: It's something I have.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: phew
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Did you see his body though...  THat was...  Strange.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Yea. He sounded mechnical...Then like a child. All in one breath.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. His movements seemed a bit... mechanical.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nods in response. <font color = white>&#34;Looked like he was built, or rebuilt maybe.&#34;</font>

She shrugs. <font color = white>&#34;Who cares. He didn&#39;t look all that strong.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches in awe as his superiors demonstrate some pretty awesome techniques. Picking his jaw up off the floor he shouts. Interjecting in the conversation about a supposedly weird body the messenger had.

<font color = white>&#34;That was awesome Koume! Kitsumi! Can you teach us how to do that?! I mean- Obviously not the body thing. But the giant lid thing?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wouldn't be surprised if he were rigged to explode as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) arrives at the gate a few deep breaths could be heard. <font color = white>&#34;Whats going on ??&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would place her hands on her hips not shinking for a moment to watch what was happening south of her from a birds eye view.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) had tensed her legs to leap free but shje found herself looking upwards amazed as the tall women suddenly towered over her and catching the worst of the attack.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Hm? Yeah, if you learn Doton I can.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) felt alot of body heat behind him. He looks behind him and a massive fat man stood there.

<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: You saved  us.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Wonder how he spread all those explosive tags without being spotted...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: He didn't do something to the guards patrolling the wall and guarding the gate, did he?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) shrugs.
 <font color = white>&#34;Dunno, but I know it&#39;s not my fault!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;...wah...&#34;</font>

Subconciously she managed to grab the cup of juice and take a sip of it - her eyes went back to normal and all the trippy stuff was gone. Fubuki was back to standing on the green tile, or rather she realized she stood on it the whole time.

She paused for a moment as she reached into her judo cloak and took out a piece of paper to read. Her gaze skimmed through it before she found the passage she was looking for.

<font color = white>&#34;however it only lasts for a short while and....and be cooled with a water source....where that water source may come from..in a village like our own?...im not sure...so be careful of this...mhm...&#34;</font>

==================== katon burn perk ==================
Name: 

Incendiary Flame  

Desc:

 This character has mastered the art of sticky flame. By carefully molding their chakra, they produce fire from a chakra fuel that is adhesive and sticks to their target once they are struck. This makes it very difficult to remove and the fire will continue burning unless the victim employs precious seconds putting out the flames. 

Note:

Those struck by a fire technique continue to burn for petty injury for two turns. The victim may use their offensive action to put it out or use a water source of medium size or above.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) It was frankly amazing that Fubuki somehow didn&#39;t suspect anything when stepping onto the red tile, only when her foot landed on it did she understand the gravity of the situation. A part of her soul began crying for help.

<font color = white>&#34;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&#34;</font>

Her whole body was surrounded by fire! Her hair and skin got completely ruined and obviously she was burning everywhere. It wasn&#39;t much fire but it was enough to really scare her. While Koume spoke, Fubuki fell to the ground and started rolling around - when she was thrown a wet towel she&#39;d turn into a flaming burrito for a few seconds, rolling with it. Then she fire was put out.

Fubuki slowly stood up and exhaled, she grabbed the other towel and started cleaning herself. <font color = white>&#34;Koume...this is...totally great training, yeah...&#34;</font> she said in pain.

It was then...&#39;crackle crackle&#39; it was then...an electric shock happened!..moving from left to right...using the water that the human body was made of as a conductor.

It was then it ended...however they would notice that the effects they suffered were worse that the poisen. But would last the less time than the poisen she used.

<font color = white>&#34;You would notice this is a lightning attack this time...these cost..an effect of electrocution....mm..no..a nervous system..error.i believe its called. It messes with your motor functions to a further degree and also messes with a casters handseal speed..not to meantion your how fast you move across the field...&#34;</font>

She paused as she laughed a bit akwardly..while placing her hands on her hips.

<font color = white>&#34;then theres the fact that you can also..stop a persons movement completely...if i remeber correctly from the stories ive heard...if hit directly with a technique itself.&#34;</font>

=========== more info below of the status aliment below ===========

Name:

Numbing Joltage  

Desc:

This character has developed the ability to sustain an electrical current that courses through the body of their victim if they are unfortunate enough to be struck by a lightning technique. The current is delivered as a numbing jolt of electricity that stuns the victim, slowing their reaction times considerably. 

Note:

Those struck by an electrifying lightning technique lose two steps of speed, agility, hand seal tempo, and tile movement until the end of their next turn.

After all it was much easier to instantly feel pain than to see it about to hit her even if it was for a split second.

Fubuki didn&#39;t have time to react to the lightning which shocked her whole body, spiking up her hair and making her stand up completely. When the shock was over everyone nearby could smell the girl was a bit burnt, right before falling to the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I-I-.---I---II....IIII...&#34;</font> the nervous shock had  been so severe she couldn&#39;t even speak, Fubuki was a frozen statue on the floor except for the occassional twitch. However this lasted only a few seconds before she stood up and regained her movement.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would laugh a bit before shaking her head meaning no.

<font color = white>&#34;u-unfortunately not..theres about...one more you might have to suffer through...before we go into..the next section.&#34;</font>

She paused.

<font color = white>&#34;b-but i dont really have a suiton tile..so your lucky mhm!..&#34;</font> With a light wink..she found herself continueing there after. <font color = white>&#34; For suiton..it mostly messes with your movement across the field...if i remeber correctly...same with fuuton....with the case it knocks you back....so your all fine on that front&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: if i had something to add..hmm..it would be to teach you about...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s eyes widened, her soul was ready to die as soon as Koume mentioned there was one more tile to go. But thankfully the game was still in early access and the suiton tile hadn&#39;t been added, so she sighed out of happiness and laid on the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m free...from the pain--&#34;</font>

And then the obstacle course turned into the other one.

<font color = white>&#34;...Fuck.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;NOT YOU.&#34;</font>

She immediately threw the shuriken towards the mushroom, hitting it on its big dumb-looking head. Fubuki had a lot of resentment for those things.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was ignored--

<font color = white>&#34;See, Raku? Not popular.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would hold up a hand to cover her mouth! 

She tried to hide the fact she was giggling at...the resentment she saw. They were off duty..so it should be..f-fine..she hoped.

====================== mushroom! =============

The yellow mushroom found themselves being attacked..and moved forwards to try and attack them before the shuriken hit their body!...however it..the shuriken hit their squishy body before they collaped on the ground to play dead!

<i>ploop!!!</i>
=====================================

<font color = white>&#34; you see...y-you see...a-ahem..you see...the reason why the mushroom couldnt counter you is because of they way the order of attacks work in this world. Perhaps made this way by the shogan himself. &#34;</font> She found herself..pausing breifly..before speaking once more.

<font color = white>&#34;Shurikenjutsu happens..first...and taijutsu happened after it mhm...however it expands to something more...as after a bit of experimentation and a few lost lifes of our iwagakurian shinobi...we have a detailed list..to make it easier for the newer generation&#34;</font>

Reaching into her pocket...she held up a piece of paper for them to read off of.

Suddenly, she reached for her flute and brought it to her lips. 
     <font color = white>&#34;...!&#34;</font> 
As the first notes flowed from her instrument, a melody filled the air, weaving through the trees and dancing across the rippling current. The sound harmonized with the peaceful ambiance, creating a magical tune that spoke straight to the heart. With every careful touch of her fingers on the flute, the girl breathed life into the scene, calling all who listened into a nod. The music resonated with joy.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) squinted.

<font color = white>&#34;Why couldn&#39;t we be alone? We all serve the shogun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: It can't be to much.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Don't jinx it...please...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Cool'
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: A custom Ogura blade is quite expensive.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) yells: Oh wow this place is pretty cool!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Uh...what do I get with three hundred ryo?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) turned his head toward the old man momentarily while maintaining eyes contact with the horse before he&#39;d inevitably turn his head backforward and inch closer toward the large mammal.
           
     <font color = white>&#34;Donut..&#34;</font>
      <font color = white>&#34;Is that your name?&#34;</font>, he asked calmly as he approached the animal.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Wait, you're going to make a doll out of someone?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I guess I could do it. My little sister might like that...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Yes. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Should I come to the other side of the counter?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana watched Asuno play her flute, the melody drifting through the air. She appreciated the technical skill, but the music felt slow and needed more emotional depth. Kohana was more drawn to the vibrant, soulful energy of R&amp;B, a genre that resonated deeply with her spirit.

As Asuno finished and introduced her plushie project, Kohana smiled politely, though her mind was still on the music. <font color = white>&#34;Not bad,&#34;</font> she replied diplomatically. <font color = white>&#34;But honestly, the tune was a bit too slow for my taste. I&#39;m more of a rhythm and soul person. Still, I&#39;m curious about your plushie project. What kind of design are you thinking about?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eyes widen with excitement as he saw many people lined up. Could this be a ninja wonder-land? As he continued to move around, he'd take note of the uniform worn by the strangers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I won't be selling anything today, but I can take orders.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Asuno on the other hand, will be.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: The design'll be made from a person here today, if there is more than one person that is interested, then we will have to play a game to find out who will be chosen.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: So this is Akihabara?..
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: What can I order with three hundred ryo? It's all I have after all. I'm looking for a blade.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (how tf does a donkey sound
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: ...This is the land of Akihabara?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (hee haw?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: So for a basic full tang katana. Can we say what amount of ryo is an acceptable fee?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Can I order 'sum 'rmor for two 'hunnit?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Wagon (The old man's wagon-) stomps the ground with his proud hooves, leaving deep marks on dirt.
Were it not for his owner's hand he might have already kicked the boy in the face.

"<i>AGGRESSIVE DONKEY SOUNDS</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) was curious what he'd could request here in the distant land.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: I guess I'll wait my turn... but I could definately use some senbons.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Don't be silly boy.. why are you trying to talk to a donkey? Donut might be smart, but he can't speak..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I'm afraid you children don't have enough for katanas or armor.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) moved towards the part of the table with the senbons on display.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm....
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Imagine approaching a rabid animal.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) sighed kinda disappointed, but she expected it. <font color = white>&#34;Alright then, at least gimme a goal - how much will I need in the future?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: An estimate works.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: A number would be nice, yes.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: If you're interested in purchasing a Ogura original, please tell me your name and what weapon you wish to have made.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: How much for a kuai?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes a moment to really experience the music. As she was of foreign origin, her music style was different than anything that had influenced him locally.
  It was peaceful, a meditation, and thought-provoking. There was a certain free essence to it.

   Yurei thought that it was beautiful, and so he stared at the young woman a bit slack-jawed.

  <font color = white>&#34;If you want me as a doll, I could help.&#34;</font> The Mugen said, blushing at her talents!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) makes a mental note on the composed girl. No one offends his donkey without getting economic sanctions..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: One-thousand for a katana.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned toward the thoughtful, composed girl who had also offered to be used as inspiration.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t back down.&#34;</font> She asserted. <font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll have to play whatever game A&#39;suno decides upon.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm Fubuki, I want a katana - one day I'll return with 700 more ryo and order it from you.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: ...!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Indeed. Or you can work in the mines for three years.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen ever so slightly as he stops just a few inches out of the donkie&#39;s hoof range.
     <font color = white>&#34;...Are-&#34;</font> - He looks at the old man. <font color = white>&#34;Would you say that this Donkey is a partner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Fubuki so you have 300?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I do yes.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: We will have to play indeed. Lets get away from the crowd. If you're interested in being a contestant for the very first edition of my plushies. Please follow me a bit north. I will then detail how the game will work.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Partner? He is my traveling partner..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh.. I wonder if Kaido would want somethin..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I suggest you all follow Asuno.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: How much for senbon kind sir?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) hopes that the kid didn't mean any other deranged form of partner.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) pumps a fist into the air.
  <font color = white>&#34;A&#39;right.&#34;</font> He smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I will have prices for weapons and more by the time you all become shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: In buisness.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: For now, the forge is closed. I will accept orders, though.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Mhm.. Donut would be my employee.. right.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Hoshino Kohana handed Fubuki 200 ryo with a playful smile. <font color = white>&#34;Here, take this. It&#39;s because we match in hair color,&#34;</font> she said, her eyes twinkling with mischief. <font color = white>&#34;Who knows, we might have some kind of blood ties,&#34;</font> she added with a light-hearted laugh, enjoying the moment. <font color = white>&#34;Consider it a gift from one lavender-haired friend to another.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Begins to scratch their head,just wondring who are these people</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm.. 
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: You mean tha' loser who called me fat?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Fubuki, I'll mark you down for a katana.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks down to the soil in thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you sell Kunais.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: Now to raise 500 more ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: You don't listen very well, do you?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Will we have permits to travel to these lands?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Also can you save and order for me? One Kunai and 10 senbons?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) followed A'suno.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Your name?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: ... Ah... My name is Afro
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I'll wait four more minutes to be sure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Did you ask them?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afro,i will check whats going on over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) needed a moment to realize she suddenly got a bunch of money from her new friend. <font color = white>&#34;Wait are you sure about this?!&#34;</font> then quickly she had to turn around to talk to the blacksmith, she was very overwhelmed by all of these things going on. <font color = white>&#34;O-okay then! I &#39;unno exactly when I&#39;ll pay you back but I&#39;ll come back and pay full price! Thank you mister!&#34;</font> she bowed towards Junji before looking at Hana again. <font color = white>&#34;Okay, I owe you one big time. I won&#39;t forget this. Now, are we going to check out that game?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Forgive me merchant, what might I refer you as?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) looks to the side, as his very poor hearing still managed to catch some of the discussion.
<font color = white>&#34;Keh keh.. young man. I already told them about the supply chain issues. But do you think kids that still smell of milk can understand?&#34;</font> he chuckles</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Junji Ogura.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I have you marked down for the kunai and senbon.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Who? Donut? I don't need to ask, this bad boy follows me wherever I go
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: One of you spoke about a game correct?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) ignored the manner as to which the merchant was flamboyant, and offer a smile. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Junji of the Ogura family. I look forward to our next encounter.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hrnnn
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Two minutes left.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) nods! <font color = white>&#34;Very sure! My father used a katana. I remember how much it meant to him. And I think I will pass on the game. I&#39;m suddenly feeling a daze.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Is it free one?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: But goodluck!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Your father is very cool. Uh, are you okay though?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: How'd you get one?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I am fine. Just need a wee nap.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Okay then. To be honest I'm kinda tired from traveling too..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So who do I talk to about gettin' some shuriken sets and a kunai?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i just remember i gotta leave irl in less than an hour lol)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: brb. gotta run to the store 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshino, Kohana(The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) OOCs: ()
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (imma go ask to get tp'd back to the village since im gonna have to leave now)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) blinks a few times a he seems to find some contentment in conversation. <font color = white>&#34;I see.&#34;</font>
He states before bowing to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you for the insight.&#34;</font>

With that he wanders off to find his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Yurei.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Weird kid. But at least he got manners..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Hey mista', what's on the menu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) points to himself when hearing the mention of weapons.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Yeah, Gramps. What's on tha' menu?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm going to buy that man's horse.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: How would the old man react to you bringing a horse home?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks toward the ground in thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I suppose you're right.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...buying their horse will be very wrong.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shakes his head. <font color = white>&#34;This old man hasn&#39;t brought anything beside..&#34;</font> he rummages through his pockets <font color = white>&#34;..two sticks worth of joints. But I doubt kids like you would be interested.&#34;</font> he shrugs, as he rolls a cig for himself.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Well shiit'
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: We don't have them in stock yet, old man.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: No one gon' know, 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to the male. <font color = white>&#34;...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It's not a horse. It's a donkey.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yells: Tsk-tsk.. kids these days.. I am a moral merchant! Shoo!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Yes'suh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) chuckles, stepping back and munching on his bag of Burritos</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So yer' a merchant that doesn't have anything to sell?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) tucks the flute into her back pocket in exchange for a pair of white dice. 
       <font color = white>&#34;This is a game I learned as a child and I used it to determine who would have leftovers between me and my late brother.&#34;</font>

The tone was upbeat despite the tragic news. 

<font color = white>&#34;The game is simple and the winner will model and recieve the very first edition of my plushie collection for free. I&#39;ll start to sell them afterwards, and that is assuming you make enough of a name for yourself to earn one.&#34;</font>

The dice are thrown into the center for the group to expect. The numbers were digital-and advanced. <font color = white>&#34;The game is called &#39;200&#39;. Everyone will roll the dice using &#39;200&#39;. The number you get will act as your next roll number, and it could range from 199-to-1, it all depends on your luck.&#34;</font>

With a soft laugh, she concludes. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll keep rolling &#39;your&#39; lowest number until you get to &#39;1&#39;. The last person to hit &#39;1&#39; will be the winner. Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Maybe we should be talkin' to that one over there.. I think they said their name was Junji or somethin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shooes away the willful kid as he turns his attention to Ogura <font color = white>&#34;You are correct young man. The supply chain won&#39;t be fixed for a couple of months still.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: inspect*
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'm a girl..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sorry to hear that flute girl..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It's okay, that is a story for another time.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But alright...guess i will play,i already know im gonna lose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her attention back to A&#39;suno, and listened. As she started to describe the game, the smaller, blue-haired, angry-looking girl recognized it as the same game that other children had been playing near the arena. It even had the same name. She wondered if it spread from Akihabara, or if it had just spread to Akihabara. Either way, she was ready to play.

<font color = white>&#34;Prepare to lose, Yurei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah, right
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Hey, mista'
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's hope this one isn't just for show..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the explanation of the game.
 <font color = white>&#34;Sounds like it&#39;s based on a roll of the dice.&#34;</font> Therefore in his mind, if he lost, it was only fate.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got this. Their gonna be sowing Mugen dolls until their fingers bleed. Ehahaha.&#34;</font> He laughed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares at the plump youth for a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t sell armor in your size, yet.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I look forward to the challenge, "Mugen".
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: A duel... of the fates.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: If you're ready, you guys can circle up and start.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who is going first?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I will.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Come closer.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: The forge isn't open at the moment, but I can take orders.

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: I forgot what I was suppose to do today...
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: But I heard you made a lot of money and started making plushies.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: That's cool.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I wouldn't say a lot...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: But, I think it's a good start. You want to come with me to Ame to drop off this Plushie when I finish?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It'll probably be the same time tomorrow. Kinda' early.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Sure I would love too.

<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: For now, I need to work on my plushie. I took some photos of the guy so it should not take me very long to thread the doll.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) asks: Hm... how long does it take to make?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Maybe thirty or fourty minutes.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Maybe I can meet the shogun one day..
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: But that's another thing. I wonder who lead's the guild here.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Shogun huh?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: I've never met him. What do you think he is like?

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Cool and the strongest swordsmen.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Doesn't sound all that strong to me if he is only using a sword, Soichiro-San.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) sat down on the edge of the stairs leading to the main floor of the blacksmith. Bored green eyes darted between the two at th counter- before a hand that had been digging around in a bag found the rice ball snacks and popped one after another into her mouth.

After chewing for a long moment she finally said, <font color = white>&#34;They haven&#39;t finished the new floors of the Inn yet, it&#39;s just an absolute mess in there.&#34;</font> The words were a bit muffled from the addition of another rice ball. But non-the-less made sense.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) Her attention is immediately captured by the sound of chewing, which she finds dreadful. It resonates in her ears like a low-battery fire alarm, causing discomforting screech in her ears. Asuno slowly turns her head to locate the source of the noise, and her eyes land on a woman eating a riceball.

Asuno&#39;s mind is flooded with a series of questions, like- 
                         Where is the Inn located? 
                              And why was it a mess?

The internal conversation is stomached like the riceballs and digested into an aloof expression on the blonde&#39;s face. She engaged, not by asking about the Inn, but instead.. 
     
       
                            <font color = white>&#34;Why are you chewing so loud..!&#34;</font>



The words blurt out unconsciously, a pet peeve having arose.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) The chewing stopped for all of .5 seconds, before something that looked round but this time made out of cake was placed in the womans mouth.
<font color = white>&#34;Not sure, this is just how I chew, never really gave it much thought.&#34;</font>

A smirk- not unlike that of the cat who spilled the milk settled on her lips as she brushed crumbs from her fingers.
<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you at the Inn before- actually lots of new faces I haven&#39;t seen before. I&#39;m Cholynn operator and proprietor of the Stone and River.&#34;</font>

This was followed by a chuckle as the bag was set to the side, <font color = white>&#34;Are you hungry? I bet I could whip up a snack or three on that furnace back there!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) was thinking of what to say before looking at the innkeeper.<font color = white>&#34;How long will it take? It can&#39;t be that bad.&#34;</font> After thinking about how he would tell Asuno he would basically explain in his own piece.<font color = white>&#34; Well the shogun is like a saviour. I heard he saved  Iwa once and granted them gifts. He lives here as our leader and guardian. That&#39;s what my dad told me.&#34;</font>

After that he sweat&#39;s.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Soichiro(The white haired teen.-Sora802) OOCs: (They need to make a aki doc cuz jeez..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I guess.. I could eat something.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: Food!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802)  eye's widen. He could not say no to food.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) pushed herself off the ground and eyed the furnace, making her way over to where the water was she procured a pot out of the bag she carried, it was large, and seemed to clank and rattle. 
 <font color = white>&#34;Noodles would be the best thing I think, I didn&#39;t bring much else besides some rice and random snacks, oh and dried fish.&#34;</font>

Sticking her head farther down into the bag, <font color = white>&#34;I bet there is an egg in here...&#34;</font>

The bag is rummaged in as the water starts to boil, the noddles are added before the egg and what looks to be a few dried veggies.
 <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;ll be good! Not my -best- but good enough for spur of the moment.&#34;</font>

Bowls were found in the bag and set to the side before being filled with the noodles, broth, egg and- carrots and that does look like green onion.
<font color = white>&#34;Ta-da! Fantasitc, supurb and good too.&#34;</font>

The noodles were carried over to the two at the front desk first, and set down gently, before she wandered back to get her own.

Onyx chopsticks were removed from her bag as she took a deep breath.
 <font color = white>&#34;Any business today?&#34;</font>

A large slurp of noodles was taken as she waited.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) --Snnnaaap--

The chopsticks are torn apart, and the sound of splinters, popping in half, sing loudly in the background. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you!&#34;</font>

Despite having chopsticks, she slups the fluid and quenches her thirst. Afterwards, she digs in. <font color = white>&#34;Somewhat. I have a plushie design that I have to complete and take to Amegakure.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;My very first plushie. It&#39;ll be rare and designed after the individual who won my contest today.&#34;</font>

She slups the noodles again. <font color = white>&#34;I need to have it finished by tomorrow. Then me and Soichiro-San will travel and deliver the item to the winner. Good marketing, I hope!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0cd987>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) slupped up a few more noodles, <font color = white>&#34;Oh a trip to one of the villages sounds neat. And good marketing indeed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) started to eat like a  mad man.<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for the food.&#34;</font> Having no manner&#39;s like usual he continued to eat like crazy he nod&#39;s at the question.<font color = white>&#34;Mhm and I will protect her while we get there. Just incase of course!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
