<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt the animal's chakra wane significantly, indicating the animal was properly bested. The boy comitted the feeling to memory--should something similar occur with someone of more active circumstances. Regardless of his participation; he felt his pocket become a slight bit fatter once the group was rewarded.

Staring at the boon, he walked over to his sister, handing her the majority. What does he need money for? He can't do much with it, that's Shuye's job anyhow.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Exicting, dìdì?&#34;</font> She asked him. She touched her pocket to pull a rice candy, only to remember that their spill in the water would have surely ruined it. Oops.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) goes to hit the ground for cover, but is far too late. The kick landing square into his chest and plummeting him into the ground by surprise.

He had been daydreaming. <font color = white>&#34;Ahh! Watch it!&#34;</font> He manages to cry out before he eats dirt</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) already was munching on the soggy balls of sweetness before she even gave tijme to consider handing it to him. He nodded softly, pulling the connective stick from his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;.............&#34;</font> He was very obviously speaking, though atop of his already whispy voice and the fact that his mouth was full, it was unintelligible.</font></font></font>

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Mugen, Yurei. Since that&#39;s handled I&#39;m gonna head back towards the north-eastern side of the village.&#34;</font> He stated before muttering something softly to himself.

  <font color = white>&#34;You can be my friend, and my brother Raku&#39;s if he takes to you.&#34;</font> Yurei followed with a nod towards direction of the taciturn one.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b6936f>Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) rubbed her nose a few times, looking at the rest of the group that'd gathered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) suddenly felt embarassed, her usually quiet brother quite loud and speaking in a tongue most of these people had never heard before. It was harsh, tonal. She looked to her brother, and the word she uttered is only one; easy to understand.

<font color = white>&#34;Mugen?&#34;</font>

She then turned toward Raku. <font color = white>&#34;--It&#39;s how we talk at home.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) says: You're right, that wasn't easy to explain at all.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) nodded in confirmation, though Shuye's divided attention forced the boy to follow suit. He didn't get the memo that others were attempting to understand what the duo was saying--only choosing to glare as per usual, wondering if there was something he said which meant something different in their language.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) rubbed his face.
  <font color = white>&#34;Still not sure how to feel about that.&#34;</font> He suffered with feeling tied to that red-headed man in some purposeless way.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) shakes his head and rubs his eyes, bringing himself temporarily back to life. He shuffles in his position and heads next to the six armed boy.

Without saying too much, he waves</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) gaze lingers on the Zhu&#39;s for a prolonged moment before he looks to his brother. <font color = white>&#34;You missed the bull earlier.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes narrow ever so slightly indicating he&#39;d gained some form of contentment from his brother&#39;s words.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) moved off from the area and towards the library.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b6936f>Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) found her ears wiggling as she very closely listened to every whisper from the 'chinese' speaking boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) squinted at Raku, and offered a correction.

<font color = white>&#34;Bu.&#34;</font> Which, clearly meant no, based off context clues. <font color = white>&#34;Xing.&#34;</font> A correction is offered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) looked at the frail black-eyed boy with a suspicious glance. He shuffled away from the boy but began to eye him with curiosity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to Shuye and blinks rather absent mindedly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) raises his head to meet the other’s sight, with a curt nod after.

<font color = white>&#34;I, uh...just wanna say six arms is really cool. Bet you don’t ever have trouble grabbing anything huh?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) says: Boo and Zing.. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You must look up Xing. Not-- whatever word you said. I would need to check my dictionary for whatever that is...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) blinked alongside Raku, something he said tipped Shuye's nationalism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) looked down at his arms, taking them out of his hoodie and clenching his multiple fists and wiggling his fingers. A slight grin appeared on his face. He had to admit, it was a bit of a funny joke.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes... the Tsuchigumo are the most powerful force in Iwagakure!&#34;</font> the boy said with a serious tone but also the naivete of his age.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Eh em...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: The six arms are pretty useful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) couldn’t help but smile at that, he enjoyed the pride the lad had for his clan. He felt very similarly, though he was constantly scolded when he brought it up - many punishments later it was something he didn’t speak of too freely now.

<font color = white>&#34;Most powerful force, huh? I’d consider my family to be the same.&#34;</font> He felt conflicted - he wanted to show up the spider boy now....but he was also interested in his person.

<font color = white>&#34;Two powerful forces coming together down the road could make them unstoppable&#34;</font> His mind deciding the next course of words for him. After all, it would be important to make friends and allies.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6699>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) Kohana&#39;s eyes narrowed as she focused on the six-armed boy. Honestly? He terrified her, and she didn&#39;t hesitate to voice her thoughts.

<font color = white>&#34;Can you use all six arms to cook? That might be the best use for those extra limbs,&#34;</font> she remarked as she approached, extending her arms and awkwardly crossing them. She had no idea how to shake hands with a six-armed freak of nature.

<font color = white>&#34;What is your family?&#34;</font> She speaks to the frail kid. Her opinion of him? His family must abuse, bully, beat, and belittle him.

<font color = white>&#34;With first glance, the umm...Six arms are better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) looks up to the kunoichi who walked over.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, hello, I’m a member of the Uchiha clan - but mostly privately tutored by my mother&#34;</font> She held strict discipline rules ever since losing their father in the war. Just hints of it would be strewn about with the way he acted - shy and mostly meek.

There was another side to him, though. One that was starting to pull while he spoke with his newly acquired Tsuchigomo er...friend? Enemy? It still remained to be seen. The little boy starting to grow into himself bit-by-bit the more he would open up.

<font color = white>&#34;I’m Kenzo, what about you and your family?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) rose an eyebrow as the thoughtful girl joined the conversation. He was feeling uneasy being surrounded by a couple of two armers. They were... different. 

<i>Cooking?!? The Tsuchigumo were warriors!</i>

But before he responded, he was distracted by Kenzo's response. 

<i>Uchiha</i>

Yes... the Uchiha were a formidable clan indeed. The blood that ran through their veins was strong. But certainly not as strong and pure as the blood of the spider.

All of that being said, Okuno was intrigued.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (sorry got pulled away for a sec)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) pauses as she turns to stare at the boy with six arms and raises three of her own to wave.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) tugs at Shuye&#39;s sleeve once more, it&#39;s been decided amongst himself that it&#39;d be best if Shuye understood what he did. After all, she&#39;s known best for a while by now, it would just be in bad faith to keep his thoughts to his own.

<font color = white>&#34;....Huigui muqin de linghun yexu shi keneng de maamaa?&#34;</font> His words were a knife, not helping by the overbearing and visceral tone which surfaces as Meixun&#39;s neutral state.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6699>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) Kohana stares at the freak...

<font color = white>&#34;Awkward...&#34;</font> Her hand retreats!

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah....&#34;</font> The rejection did not happen if she did not adknowledge it!

Kohana nods respectfully to both, her movements precise and controlled. She introduces herself with the utmost grace, a testament to the strict discipline she has endured from her own mother. However, again not as bad as it seems this Uchiha&#39;s mother treats her own.
<font color = white>&#34;A&#39;lass I am not of noble blood as you both. I am Hoshino, Kohana.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (misread your RP about crossing your arms. whoopsies. we'll roll with it)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (BTW!  I'm getting the Tsuchi bow and those Tsuchi throwing weapons iconed.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) glanced at the retreating hands of Kohana. Perhaps she should be bowing to their noble blood instead?

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to recognize our families. I am Tsuchigumo, Okuno&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) bows with respect in response towards Kohana, remembering to keep his manners about him at all times. It didn’t matter who a person was, as holding respect to everyone would find you your own. At least that’s how he’d seen it.

He was careful though, not to see his mother about. It was late, but there was no telling when she would be out looking for him. If she woke, eventually she would come to find him.

A respectful bow to Okuno as well, as he directs to the both of them. <font color = white>&#34;Well met. Have you guys heard much about what to expect as Genin?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Oh another Tsuchigumo.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: I have no clue what to expect. My parents aren't shinobi sadly.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Yes, am also of the Tsuchigumo.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: The jonin I would assume.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) points to himself when addressing the somber-looking girl.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: Maybe I should become a chef like mom.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) says: I’m Uchiha, Kenzo
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ahh! I've been lookin' for more Uchiha. Thought everyone was just snoozin' or somethin'
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'm Uchiha, Reilin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed to rouse out of a stupor. His words send a coursing torrent of anger through her. Not at him. It&#39;s at what he brings up. It&#39;s one of the things in her life that made her who she was; that loss. That absence. It&#39;d filled her with the need to take up that role as best as she could, along with the role she already had of being an elder sister.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;</font> She answered, in the more common tongue. <font color = white>&#34;I hope not. I hope she has moved on.&#34;</font> It was a mature take. One whose sincerity she struggled to actually hold. She missed her. It was hard to wish well on what you didn&#39;t want to lose when it slipped through your grasp. She almost left it at that, before remembering who she was talking to.

<font color = white>&#34;But if she hasn&#39;t, then you will find her.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: The struggles of a big family. Sheesh.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Mmh... the path of the shinobi is hard. Not everyone is born for it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) asks: Being a man with six arms. Could you not make a mean stir fry?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) bows to his fellow Uchiha, <font color = white>&#34;I also expected the rest of our clan was snoozing. I don’t think we’ve met before now?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) says: I don’t often attend family events, not until I’m a Genin mom says
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) let out a sigh. He would indulge the cooking question.

<font color = white>&#34;I think if I tried I could make the meanest and most angry stir fry ever cooked! The timing of all the ingredients could be absolutely perfect with all of these arms.&#34;</font> he said, gesturing all of his appendages... eh em... arms... around.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (That's the second Tsuchigumo including me.  Which means there's still 3 more to come.)
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Okuno...  Can you make sandwiches?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) folded her arms before chuckling. She looked toward Kenzo and could appreciate how formal he was. Though she didn&#39;t reciprocate the action. It was clear she was a bit more rough around the edges than him.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll be Genin soon. Then we can do whatever tha&#39; heck we want... &#39;least I will.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kenzo(The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) OOCs: (Another will be on tmrw

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) grew a big smile on his face. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever we want, that’s right. Being a tried and true shinobi will change it all. And the future is ours, too&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) turned around to his cousin Tsuneko, shrugging slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Well yeah. Even the two arms can make sandwiches.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (I think there was 5 slots last I saw?

<font color = white>&#34;Wow, that sounds amazing!&#34;</font> she exclaimed, her tone filled with genuine enthusiasm. Perfectly timed ingredients in a stir fry? You could become the ultimate chef! We could franchise my parents&#39; restaurant and become disgustingly rich!&#34;</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) wrapped his arms around his sister, recognizing immediately the distress he'd caused--bringing up something so....Taxing on the mind definitely had an affect on the girl's spirit. It's a good thing he's so well attuned to this feeling, because, well--he's completely null to the more explicit physicality of emotional states.

He doesn't know that she's only affirming him to quell his prodding, though he accepts her answer nonetheless. He remains the hug for a while, not letting her loose until he feels her signature relax a slight bit. Until then, a silent embrace is all he can provide.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: Indeed. I can feel the ryo already. But first I have to figure out this genin thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) returned the hug, wrapping both arms arouind the smaller boy for a long while. Maybe half a minute, before she finally gently stepped back while pushing him lightly until her hands firmly grasped on his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;I, sleep.&#34;</font> She announced, dramatically-- like the title of a play.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (Not exactly. The Bee Style also had a throw sword and pick it back up for free mechanic. So I had a point floating thats why I was thinking Enhanced)

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. I assume that's good.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm well its no fun if we sit around all day with nothing to do. Hey Shuye
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I know. I just think training usually isn't fun.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) wandered towards the edge of the moat, and seated herself with her legs dangling above the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Plenty things t&#39;do&#39;n yer downtime.&#34;</font>

Speaking of, she produced a book from the pouch on her flank, and flipped it to a page with a bookmark.

<font color = white>&#34;Ain&#39; like we&#39;re soldiers yet, anyway.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yet, soon we might be though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Not yet no
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Well if I get placed on a team with either of you. I'll try to help cover you with my doton
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll bonk people with my swords, when I get them.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Mm. Probably won' be leavin' the village on missions fer a long time. Oughta look into a different squadmate than me.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wouldn't mind having either of you as squadmates.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Gettin' 'long don' mean much if yer squaddie ain' good fer fightin', 'n ah'm tellin' ye, ah probably won' be fer a hot minute.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: This shit's so complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Neither will I, I dunno how to use a sword much less two. Meanwhile people are gonna throw fireballs and shit.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Elemental jutsu is foundational to combat.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah. Imma not use it though.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Won' have the time t'learn any.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Why is that?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wanna focus on swords instead. No time to learn much else.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) squinted.

<font color = white>&#34;Does it take that much dedication?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Can' juggle medical bullshit 'n elemtal bullshit'n the same time, 'cause reasons.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) nodded.

<font color = white>&#34;Maybe if only I used one sword, but if I wanna use two? Probably.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (Elemental*)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i thought it was on purpose bc of her accent lol)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (That's the true superpower of writing an accent. People can never tell.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned. So many people were medically inclined, it was almost shocking. At least there would be no lack of colleagues...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: How're things you all?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: 'Kay I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Fine.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Hi.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Think Raku's still asleep.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Is anyone training today?
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Nay right now, clearly.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'm more a book reader than a trainer.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Books are a good way of training the mind.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Likewise.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) was in fact, reading right in this moment, holding a book in one hand, and scribbling notes on a little pad with the other. All while sitting dangerously on the edge of the moat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I'm done with my meat-cutting for the day, I was hopin' to get into somethin' less dull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) walked up behind the white-haired person, peeping in to see what they were reading without invading their personal space.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Are you the son of a butcher?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn&#39;t appear to care much for the approaching youth, and simply continued to study. It quickly became apparent she was was reading about everyone&#39;s favourite topic of treatment methods for various kinds of fungal infections. In this particular instance, stomach infections, and all the not-so-pleasant symptoms, and how to quell them.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Fraid ah ain&#39; known t&#39;be much fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) shook his head, medical studies were an interesting topic. He began to see different roots praised for their antifungal properties and ailments which could be caused by an infectious encounter with them.
 Truth be told, he had no real idea what he was looking at, but caught the gist.

   Turning around to face north he speaks out while sitting on the ground.
<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s like a general goods man, has his hands in different things. Some of the meat will go to our home, some will be sold.&#34;</font> Yurei describes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn't look particularly happy with the topic, but what could she do. Hunkering down, and learning it was a simple requirement if she wanted to excel, even if studying definitely wasn't a fun occasion for her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crossed her arms. She thought about whether to keep asking him things about it, but instead shared about herself--

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m a vegetarian.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: So what you eat plants?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Well, not just plants. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...Actually, yes, just plants. I guess fruit are technically from plants. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) wrinkled her nose as the dust storm rolled on in, and called it a day for studying.

<font color = white>&#34;...Oughta get a pair o&#39; goggles.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: .... so dujsty.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: I get it, does it get boring?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Ugh, my eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Not to me! You can use a lot of different toppings.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked distant--

<font color = white>&#34;You don&#39;t want to know what too much meat does to you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shields himself from the raging dust and begins to make his way off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns, equipped with a straw hat on his head and another in hand. In a swift motion he'd look to offer the other to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes the hat and then places it on top of his head to wall the dust from his face.
  <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, Raku, what a surprise.&#34;</font> He stated with a smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods and parts his lips to speak once more.
  <font color = white>&#34;I spoke to a higher-up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Did they give you orders to get us hats?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: They said we may have the power to surpass the Shogun.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: The Mugen clan is that strong?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm not sure..
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Are we a clan?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Kind of, but kind of not.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: To be able to surpass the Shogun, you'd have to be stronger than strong.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Why would you even want to do that? 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: i kinda like the idea of peace area to meet other people in the future.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Not real sure.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I feel like the Shogun is one-hundred years old.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I was told that even he can bleed.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: And just as energy recycles, so does power.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I don't think I want power, Yurei.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) nuzzled his mouth lower into the collar of his hoodie as the dust storm raged across the village. Just another day in Iwagakure.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Mmh...
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: M'gonna be back'n a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Don't really get it myself. Maybe they were talkin' about the village, or themselves.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) kneaded some chakra in his mouth before opening his lips and depositing a golden coin-shaped object. He began flicking it between all thirty fingers.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) yells: It's still storming!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) returned! Now wearing a pair of goggles so she wouldn't have to squint.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It storms quite a bit...it's really annoying. I can't see shit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) shot a quick glance at his peers talking before shrugging and returning to his coin.

<font color = white>&#34;We have to be comfortable in it. If we&#39;re used to it, our enemies will have quite a hard time attacking us here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What if they wear goggles?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Doubt they could even make it through the front door.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Thank god it's over...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hello, hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) head flicks upward as the sandstorm subsides. <font color = white>&#34;Mm..&#34;</font>, he hums to himself as he&#39;d became lost in thought. Eventually, he&#39;d tuck away the straw hat in his void like confines and began to make his way off.

   <font color = white>&#34;Library.&#34;</font>, is all he says to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How's it goin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) uses a line of twine to rope the straw hat to his backside before heading west after a while.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sup, nothing really going on.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just staring at this arena, and the water.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Sounds like a buzzkill to be honest.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nothing else to do until we get a class honestly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (everytime the game lags before i post i have the fear i mischannel'd or some shit)

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Taijutsu, shurikenjutsu and eventually kenjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ooh.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmm, I myself will be using Katon, shurikenjutsu and well I haven't thought of anything else just yet

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I just wants swords, man.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Using kenjutsu would be a lot of fun but I can't really spread myself too thin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, fair enough. I dunno how much I'll use ranged weapons anyways. I prefer to get close to my enemies.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Well that's good to know, if we ever go on any missions together that is.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Damn kdis
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Eh?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Who're you, Gramps?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) turned around towards the merchant and raised her hand.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: He looks old

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) looks over at the red afro girl, <font color = white>&#34;Old? Look here young man! Mind your elders!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You're right, they really do look like a boy...

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: The Inuzuka clan doesn't seem to have any one in our age group. But. They do have dogs.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Don't ya smell that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, must be nose blind.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Sticks her tongue out at the old man. The girl had blinked a few times.. before offically responding towards him. <font color = white>&#34;Mind my elders? I don&#39;t even know you, and you should get your eyes checked old timer. I am not a man or a guy, I am frankly surpised someone as old as you is still alive..&#34;</font> She groaned, before turning her attention to her brother. The girl moved over towards his side. <font color = white>&#34;Hey nii-san.&#34;</font> She said standing before him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Wha'cha doin' here, Gramps?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: He's probably here to visit a tailor.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches with amusement as his younger sister roasts the strange old man. As she approaches, he reaches out and moves to lightly karate chop her. Tapping her head with his hand as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Himeki. Who&#39;s the old guy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) mumbles, <font color = white>&#34;Damn snot nosed brats,&#34;</font> to himself before closing his eyes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times as she shifted her attention towards him. She had gently grabbed his hand.

<font color = white>&#34;What ya doing? And I have no idea, he seems rude.&#34;</font> She had said before saying.

<font color = white>&#34;Another game of 200?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (And buying my first core)

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Rest well, Gramps.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm, if you need anything mister let us know.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm not doing anything yet. Pretty quiet morning so far. Did dad give you more money to bet with? Cause I was serious yesterday! Tired of playing two-hundred and betting with cool rocks...

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: No
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hey, Kaido. How're you doin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) flicked the sticky coin he had produced across his fingers once more, taking in the situation quietly with a wandering violet gaze. A dark eyebrow would be raised at the grumpy old merchant.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) nods at Rellin and lets out a huge sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhh I&#39;m doing pretty good you know. Getting better, going to be the greatest in my specialization one day heh. How are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) begins counting his ryo over, becoming increasingly proud of his earnings.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) finally removes his hand from atop her head and stuffs it into his pocket. Sighing as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Then we&#39;re not gonna play two-hundred. Rolling dice just to roll dice isn&#39;t fun...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: yI need to make some money, who's got some?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: *I*
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll give you 100 ryo if you give me 200 ryo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) eyes panned between the collective. Silently observing his soon to be peers as the intereact with one another and form indepenent fractions. At this moment all he required was some form of indication of who was in charge. He wasn't sure if the village had an active chuunin nor Jounin.

But it was probably wise to keep a close eye on every's attire. Maybe there he'd be able to parse out the officials from the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances at the light purple haired girl.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not even pretty enough to talk to, go make me a sandwhich.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirled her hair around her index finger idly while she conversed. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. I think I&#39;ll be the best in mine as well. Make sure you don&#39;t fall behind.&#34;</font> she said with a light chuckle.

<font color = white>&#34;Care to share what your specialization will be, or are you one of the people who like to keep secrets?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll keep it a secret for now!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) raised an eyebrow at the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Why would I do anything for you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Man, secrets are lame. Isn't she supposed to be your wife or whatever too? That's gonna be a tough marriage...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances back at the girl.

<font color = white>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t you? You&#39;ve got two hands and I forgot to do the dishes at home. Chop chop!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll tell you in private later Rellin!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Eh, pay me 100 ryo and I'll do it.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Happy wife happy life.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I was just saying that before, you're not pretty enough to pay.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: You should be happy I'm even talking to you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Really? I think she's pretty pretty.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Then marry her.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, I gotta get rich and famous first. Maybe later.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How are you going to get famous?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Throwing mountains at people.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) gave a thumbs up at Hideo before looking at the other boy before.

<font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re not gonna pay me, I won&#39;t do anything for you, simple as.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) quickly returns the thumbs up.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) asks: ...Anyone even got cash 'sides what we earned from the race?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Why would you want an ugly maid? Get your priorities straight before you get cash.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I'll through you at people.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shaked her head.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She totally did...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Yeah. Is that supposed to be a good amount?

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrm.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: How far away am I from a sword? That's all I care about.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Kinda want to play again
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: For double the money
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I missed the games.

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: 'Bout, like, two-thousand-somethin'.

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Name o' the weapon ye dolt.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: O-Oh, I knew that.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I just had the strong urge to rob someone.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: But that would be wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Very wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah man robbing people is messed up.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Unless it's like, part of a mission. Then it's pretty cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) perks up from the scroll he was lazily perusing through.
  <font color = white>&#34;What a thing to say.&#34;</font> He became even less engaged in the writings.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: MM that reminds me... I meant to go shopping earlier.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) flicked the synthetic golden coin behind him. The sticky object thudded into the dust at the base of a nearby tree. He cracked all thirty knuckles, stretched for a moment, and took his leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Narusari, Yuu has gone AUTOAFK*

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Get food.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Naaah that sounds like a lot of effort right now.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Hungry...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Wish father was around

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Sorry anyone want to play 200?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: For fun?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I think my luck needs recharging for a few years.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) reached into one of her pouches, and withdrew... A protein bar? The unhealthy honey, and chocolate-brand.

<font color = white>&#34;Dice &#39;n me don&#39; get &#39;long.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) side-eyes Iroha&#39;s snack for a long moment. Eventually sighing and looking back toward those present. Mumbling, mostly to himself,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) did not, in fact, lower her voice. She spoke plainly, and clearly. Well, as clearly as her horrid accent could allow her to, anyway.

The snowtop gave a lazy roll of her shoulders.
