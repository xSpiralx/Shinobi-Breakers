<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) walked up to the edge of the water and looked down at the boy who was currently at the mercy of the currents. He would shake his head and sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font>

He would then simply jump into the water, swimming over to the injured boy and grabbing him by his underarms, then proceeding to use a half back stroke to swim back to the edge of the water and pull both himself and the boy out of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp... Anybody wanna take him to the hospital?&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t seem too thrilled on the aspect of transporting blast to the hospital so he hoped somebody else could do it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was holding on to a thread of his consciousness.
<font color = white>&#34;A hospital?&#34;</font>
His tone made it seem like he was against it. Unwilling to go to such an establishment. Was there a bigger reason behind it.

<font color = white>&#34;They&#39;ll put me further in to the system. Can&#39;t have that.&#34;</font>
Grabbing hold of that thread a bit tighter and forcing himself to withstand the crucial pain from the recent assault.
<font color = white>&#34;Thank you kind sir...-BUT I will tough it out.&#34;</font>, wiping his tears away in a dramatic fashion and now standing ten toes.

Looking to the one known as...Tatsu? Maybe. He cared little for any names. They were still students and it wasn&#39;t like he shared life or death with them in the field of unknown battle outside of their home.
<font color = white>&#34;You are a good guy. Stay that way.&#34;</font>
Giving him a thumbs up along with a smile that went with it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) looked the boy up and down, he definitely looked quite hurt but seeing as he was refusing treatment he didn&#39;t think he was in the position to force him to go to the hospital.

<font color = white>&#34;Well... Okay then, no problem.&#34;</font>

He would return the thumbs up and then look around for the boy&#39;s clothes which may have ended up being washed away in the water.

<font color = white>&#34;You might wanna put some clothes on though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) took a few steps back to get distance from her opponent, slowly but surely going towards the wall.

<font color = white>&#34;Phew...it&#39;s kinda hot in here actually...maybe I should--&#34;</font>

Then she&#39;d turn around and quickly fit the stick through the hole. She used no strength but if someone was truly peeping then she&#39;d be able to find out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: But this practice makes a weakness of mine a strength.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) leans in a bit closer, his heart starts racing, and he drools. <font color = white>&#34;<i>D-damn.. they&#39;re actually gonna get nekked?</i>&#34;</font> Suddenly a stick breaches his spy hole and stabs him in the eye. <font color = white>&#34;G-gah!&#34;</font> Ashimiya collapses.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Hanaka, Ashimiya(Dbz563187) has been knocked out.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) smirked and left the stick in the hole, as a warning incase someone tried peeking again. Hearing the boy collapse to the floor confirmed her suspicions.

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for letting me know there was someone there Himeki.&#34;</font> She said before slowly walking back to outside the water.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Welp, I&#39;m gettin&#39; in tha&#39; water.&#34;</font> the teen said. She decided to change inside, though. Folding her kimono and putting it away before returning in a towel.

The girl took a dip into the water, swimming around freely.

<font color = white>&#34;So who else is lookin&#39; forward to becomin&#39; a Genin?&#34;</font> she inquired.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) used her free hand to move one of her raven locks behind her ear before commenting.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) laid against the back as she avoided getting into the water, she felt too old compared to anyone else to do it.

<font color = white>&#34;I wanna a lot. That&#39;s like, one of my goals One of my uhh...five goals. Damn I have too many goals..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: one day..il become a genin..

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) says: Becoming a Jonin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But first you gotta be a Chunnin.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Pfft.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: And for that you gotta be a Genin.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) says: Also not an accomplishment...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: That's just tha' same thing with extra steps
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) says: Anyone can become Genin or Chuunin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I think you're underrating those ranks a lot.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) shrugs, and turns a page. <font color = white>&#34;I never said they weren&#39;t important. They&#39;re just not an accomplishment.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would lightly take off her boots..and long socks..as she rested them besides herself. She found herself sitting down and crossing her legs enjoying the waters warmth.

Reaching into her kimono, she slowly took out a clipboard..as she listened to the genin talk. Filling out more information about the lore of herbs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: S'all tha' same, though.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) drops his gaze in thought for a moment. <font color = white>&#34;....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up to the Uchiha, monotone ever-present as he spoke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I think we are both smarter.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) says: Just studious.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) couldn&#39;t help but snicker at his remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Well that&#39;s one thing ya&#39; got in common. Can&#39;t fight ya&#39; on that.&#34;</font> she continued swimming about. <font color = white>&#34;But your personalities too. Both of ya&#39; talk in that same dull tone. Not much fer&#39; words and got an answer for anythin&#39;!&#34;</font> she said which was followed by more laughter.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) began to think once again, a dull matte finish overtaking his once glossy pupils.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up again.
  <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) flipped another page. <font color = white>&#34;And you talk a lot for someone who has nothing to say.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) thought about filling her mouth with water to spit out but when she realized this was a very public body of water she decided against it. Instead she wished she was in a river or ocean or something that flowed.

After hearing Ume speak she turned her gaze towards her. <font color = white>&#34;Heh, I got lots ta&#39; say. Ain&#39;t you been listenin&#39;? Juss&#39; from this conversation I met you an&#39; Bookworm #2. Learned about yer&#39; personalities and...&#34;</font> she paused, swimming a bit closer to the edge.

<font color = white>&#34;I decided. I like Raku more. He&#39;s a know-it-all but he&#39;s not as stuck-up.&#34;</font> she said with a wide grin. She knew Ume wouldn&#39;t care anyhow.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) nodded, and turned her page.

A newfound sense of distance formed between the hot springs, a place often overlooked but particularly busy today. It didn&#39;t matter to the quiet, frail boy.

He removed silky fabrics before walking out to the male area with a towel and shorts on. The reticent young boy slipped into the water, placing a palm onto the sand used for decoration. He would start practicing imbuing it with his Chakra.

After accomplishing that, he would shift it around without weaving a single seal.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) glances to the side, his eyes falling on the duo, inviting them to speak their name. They seemed to be a pair, however he could not be certain.

His attention then given to the two men standing before them, nodding as they each introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Mugen, of the Utsuwa Clan and Iwagkaure Jounin.&#34;</font>,he said leaning onto his staff slightly, exuding and aura of confidence and stalwart strength.

<font color = white>&#34;Head of millitary affairs would be me and my compatriot, Kitsu&#39; &#34;</font>,he grinned.

<font color = white>&#34;You havent come to declare war on us now&#34;</font>?,he laughed to himself.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m joking...please tell us your proposal our crafters are not half as renowned as Akihbara&#39;s, we are all ears.&#34;</font>,he folded his arms awaiting their answer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) was calmly gazing at the back of the old man's head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) was drinking water until he almost spit&#39;s it out. He was a samurai in training. He was not ready for the smoke.<font color = white>&#34;Guh good one.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) uses Soichiro&#39;s shoulder for leverage and stands.
           <font color = white>&#34;Hi,&#34;</font> she says, chiming in where Junji left off.
<font color = white>&#34;...my name is Asuno, and I would like to play a tune for you all. I am thankful for your time here today.&#34;</font>

The youth retrieves the flute from her side and carefully inspects the golden pipe, a routine developed over time.
                      <font color = white>&#34;...this performance is called, &#39;Thank You For Your Attention.&#34;</font> 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1jJCH32OU] 

With a calm expression, the musician closes her eyes and places her soft lips upon the flute. As she exhales, a melody dances from the instrument, filling the room with light, metaphorical music notes. <font color = white>&#34;~..~...!&#34;</font>

The music stopped, and the girl bowed.
                <font color = white>&#34;I am here today to expand my art portfolio..&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I would love to sell my art dolls to the world but without proper models and influential figures, the brand will be unknown and a failure. No one will want a no-named doll in their collection.. and so I come here today, to meet the most popular and most influnetial shinobi in the land in order to craft a doll in their image.&#34;</font>

The blonde pulls out a doll, made from a Amegakure student. <font color = white>&#34;Here is an example.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (drop ur rp first old head
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) grunts after the musical performance, <font color = white>&#34;Well...ain&#39;t that something!&#34;</font> He her a head nod, 

<font color = white>&#34;Back to the topic at hand, &#34;</font> You&#39;ll find that we&#39;re all able to make weapons and armor but each of us is unique in our own way, thus we might all have a diffrent proposal for you to think over, still, even though we might have an individual purpose, the over-arching goal is the same, to secure an agreement between your villiage and Akihabara!&#34;</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) smiles, the music resonating with him, as his head swayed the tune easing any tension left in the room carrying it away with the melody. Mugen placed a hand on his chin as he continued to enjoy the proformance.

<font color = white>&#34;Bravo..thank you miss Asuno&#34;</font>,the jounin said giving a small round of applause, his head tilting to the side as she expained her reason for coming to iwagakure.

His smile which had already been plastered on his face, grew to stretch from <b>ear to ear.</b>

<font color = white>&#34;Ha&#34;</font>!,he exclaimed as he slammed his fist into the desk, the sound of the collision echoing through the large room.

<font color = white>&#34;My daughter wanted a doll of me, i was scrambling my brain thinking of how i would get her one, you lady Asuno are a life saver&#34;</font>!,the jounin declared, before clearing his throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahem- yes sorry...back to the topic as hand indeed.&#34;</font>,his full attention back on the old man.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Sorry about that!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (One sec lemme catch up
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) clapped her hands in appreciation.
    Watching a plan work to perfection was akin to completing a marthon. 

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s great. I wanted to show you a sample, but it looks like my doll was ripped in the process. Forgive me.&#34;</font>

The woman drips a hand into her backpocket. <font color = white>&#34;All I need from you is three angle shots and atleast a day&#39;s worth of time. The Akihabar Merchants can return to hand deliver your item...&#34;</font>

She pauses again, and looks around.
   <font color = white>&#34;..you are the most popular and influential shinobi in the land,&#34;</font> she says with a hint of doubt, brows risen. 
                      <font color = white>&#34;..right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: There are a couple of terms we Akihabara Merchants have.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) blinked a few times listening along quietly. This is where the dolls had come from? Well, at least it made sense now.

Letting out a sigh, she would begin speaking.
 <font color = white>&#34;Unfortunately we&#39;re a bit.. Lacking, in terms of &#39;famous&#39; Shinobi at the moment. Aside from the three of us here. Lord Tomoe, our Tsuchikage, has departed to your village along with an escort that consists of.. A large amount of our troops.&#34;</font>, she said with a nod.

Looking over the group that had come once again, she releases a small chuckle.
 <font color = white>&#34;Though, I suppose there&#39;s no harm in allowing you time to make your dolls. So long as the other merchants here are taking orders for our up-and-coming Genin.&#34;</font>

She directed her attention back towards the three in the center of the room.
 <font color = white>&#34;And to answer your question, yes. There are few more notable than Mugen and myself.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Narusari, Yuu(The old merchant-MyG) OOCs: (did my say get eatne?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Not for me)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) scrambles to her seat, <font color = white>&#34;Understood miss! Please direct me to whoever is available and fits the description! After the meeting of course. That&#39;s all I had.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [i see it!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: In the future, I believe it would wise to also employ the use of your shinobis when it comes to requiring protection for our caravans.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: That could be arranged, though there would need to either be payment or an exchange of goods.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: We also require the ability to come into and exit your lands at our leisure, this ability would cover our escourts as well. We of course would submit to all of your rules and laws
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Rip Mugen)
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Mhm.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (-_-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) mulled over the thought for a moment. Allowing anyone free passage into the village was often something that took a long and tedious process to approve. However..
 <font color = white>&#34;Sure. So long as you submit to random luggage checks, just to ensure the safety of those inside.&#34;</font>, she said with a nod. <font color = white>&#34;Likely not everytime, and maybe never. But, it is the price for free access without needing someone escorting you around the village.&#34;</font>

As she finished, she leaned forward, placing her elbow on the desk and resting her head on her hand.
 <font color = white>&#34;Aside from that, you&#39;re merchants so allowing you access to deal with our forces is only beneficial.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) rubbed his chin.
<font color = white>&#34;Yes our Shinobi are more than capable..&#34;</font>,he noded.

<font color = white>&#34;There are security concerns and open border would incur yes, not long random inventory checks but we would have to supply limited seals or talismans only to be distributed to offical merchants of this trade agreement..&#34;</font>,the mans mind was working out all the issues with the deal, that could threaten the safety of his village.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (*not only 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) nods his head in agreement, <font color = white>&#34;We are nuetral in all manners, I assure you no Akihabara Merchant would knowingly allow his or her trade to be hijacked by anyone with ill intentions. Still, I understand to make sure we are doing what we say we are and nothing more.&#34;</font>

Yuu rests his other hand on his cane, <font color = white>&#34; I&#39;m old enough to have seen a war or two in my life time, nasty bussiness!&#34;</font>

Yuu shakes his head, <font color = white>&#34; We request that we be left out of all wars concerning you and your allies and enemies, bussiness must go on, if a Akihabara merchant is caught between you and and enemy, we request that our merchants not be harmed in the conflict so long as they do not attempt to interfere in the fight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) twirled his fishing pole while the old man was talking and he realized he would have to get stronger soon. The world as he knew was not safe.<font color = white>&#34;If war happen&#39;s I have to prepare my survival guide. Don&#39;t worry old man. Once I complete my training it&#39;s up for evil doers!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nodded along in agreement. Merchants were akin to civilians, just people looking to make a living off of their trade. There was often little reason, or tactical benefit, in harming a civilian-- Let alone one that also benefitted everyone.

Turning towards Mugen for a moment, she&#39;d nod a single time before shifting back towards Yuu.
 <font color = white>&#34;That is fine. As long as the village of Akihabara remains neutral in any and all conflicts, then they will be guaranteed safety from the forces of Iwagakure.&#34;</font>, she&#39;d state flatly, pausing for a moment after. <font color = white>&#34;However.&#34;</font>

She sat back up, placing both hands on the table in front of her. It was rare, if ever, to see the Shingen Jonin speak in a serious tone or even give much thought and care to what she was doing. The one thing she would never slack on, though, was the safety of those around her. Their Tsuchikage being a shining star of an example that she wished to follow.
 <font color = white>&#34;If at any point that neutrality is broken, there will be consequences to pay and the village will be seen as an enemy. As well, if there are any conflicts within our borders, your merchants are to bring it up to either Mugen or myself, should Lady Tomoe not be around. Any hostility will void all neutrality views.&#34;</font>

She paused for a moment again.
 <font color = white>&#34;This doesn&#39;t mean our Shinobi will bring harm to any of you, and if anyone tries unprovoked I will handle it personally.&#34;</font>, she vented a sigh, leaning back into her chair. <font color = white>&#34;Is this clear?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) need not say anything, only letting the weight of his chakra press down on the merchants and the seriousness of his aura speak for him. The jounin nodding towards his partner a sign of his full support and backing of her statement.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Reasonable
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) offered a smile and thumbs up.
 <font color = white>&#34;Cool!&#34;</font>, her youth shining through. <font color = white>&#34;All is good then, yeah?&#34;</font>

She stretched herself out, pushing against the chair to lean back on two legs as she did.
 <font color = white>&#34;Whew! Meetings suck.&#34;</font>, she continued, a small <i>thud</i> echoing out as she stopped stretching. <font color = white>&#34;Is there anything else?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would form a reassuring small smile.as she formed a unsure look before raising a hand to cover her mouth. Coughing a bit....

T-that was..sudden...but then she heared something about meetings sucking and she spoke there after. <font color = white>&#34;definately..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Merchant.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Hmmm

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) spoke calmly despite him having asked multiple times.
