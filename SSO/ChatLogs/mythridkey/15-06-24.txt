<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Hey!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Hm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) shifts his attention away from his shop to attend to the blonde girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing near my forge, missy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) throws her hands into the air. She wanted the merchant to drop his guard and realize how harmless she was.
      <font color = white>&#34;Woah, my bad mister. I was checking out the area.&#34;</font>

The teenager places her palms together, lines connected. 
With a bend, she respectfully bows, displaying manners to add on to her show.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) sizes up the lass, before frowning. A sour look was visible on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;Ick. Well, don&#39;t just stand there, girl. Tell me your name and tell me who dressed you in those rags.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) was dressed in relaxed attire.
She swiftly arranges her blonde bang after straightening from the bow. <font color = white>&#34;Certainly, sir,&#34;</font> she replies.

With grace, she retrieves a golden flute and plays a captivating melody for the merchant. The musical enchantment is soothing, to the extent that it seems as though the notes spring to life, swirling around them as she performs. The lackluster surroundings are infused with vibrant hues, accompanied by an attractive head nod of her music..
....she paused.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Asuno. These garments were passed down to me by my sickly mother.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) lessens his scowl as the music flows amongst them. A calming melody soothed his heart. His aggressive demeanor soon dissipates, as he nod his head several times in Asuno&#39;s direction.

<font color = white>&#34;Junji. Junji Ogura. Seems like you possess some talent. Are you a street performer?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: A wonderful day..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) In a serene setting, a young girl with flowing blonde hair plays a melodic tune on her flute. The enchanting melody fills the air as she sits peacefully in an open space, surrounded by the beauty of nature. 

At the age of fourteen, she possesses a remarkable skill, captivating all who listen to her music.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Asuno has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) slowly walks over to the anvil.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) stretches into a soft yawn. 
      <font color = white>&#34;...!&#34;</font>
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m awake.&#34;</font>

The reply is followed by a stretch with her left hand pushing down into her right palm, arm pits exposed.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Hm. Asuno, that filthy girl is my adopted child. Introduce yourself.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) points to the girl on her left. <font color = white>&#34;Her?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Hi, I am Asuno. Local resident. A pleasure to meet you. What is your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares daggers at his adopted daughter.

<font color = white>&#34;Greet her quickly or it&#39;s back to the mines with you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) looks between the two with a hint of concern. 
Her eyes opened wide.
    <font color = white>&#34;...!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Hazuni (The dusty child-Goku509) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Hi, did you hear my introduction?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I would hate to see you get in trouble with your parent. 
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Hazuni (The dusty child-Goku509) yells: Trouble?! Did I not bring enough coal back from the mines?!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Hazuni (The dusty child-Goku509) says: Oh boy, dad's going to be mad.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: He sounded mad, that's f'sure.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: You better be careful. What's your name?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Hazuni (The dusty child-Goku509) asks: I'm Hazuni. What about you?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Asuno, aspiring flute-playing professional.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Nice to meet'cha Hazuni!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Hazuni (The dusty child-Goku509) asks: You too! So you can play the flute?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Hazuni (The dusty child-Goku509) asks: What's your favourite flute song?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) The blonde musician retrieves the flute from her side, carefully inspecting the golden pole. Her eyes scan the instrument before a gentle smile spreads her lips. 

<font color = white>&#34;Yep. I  do.&#34;</font>
        <font color = white>&#34;...and my favorite song?&#34;</font>

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4z5kntXAA]

With a soft expression, the musician closes her eyes and places her lips upon the flute. As she exhales, a melody dances from the instrument, filling the air with light, metaphorical notes.

<font color = white>&#34;It goes something like that,&#34;</font> she concludes.</font></font></font>
