<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) takes another step back. <font color = white>&#34;You were taught how to do that?&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;How?&#34;</font>

She was still in disbelief. The idea of walking on water did not compute to her as a humble daughter of a salesman in Akihabara.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) had his jaw dropped. This was bad. In the future his friend might counter the dirty and trickful ninjas.<font color = white>&#34;Oh no you need to learn..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Why so? Are they bad?
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: There will be times where you will need to walk or run away in the water.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: So... I need to learn that to survive?
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Yes.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) asks: I forgot to ask you. Do you plan to be craftsmen here?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: No, not really.

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Then what do you plan to do here...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I'unno! It's just where I was born. I'll make something of myself.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) twirled his fishing pole. He was worried for his friend but he could protect her.<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry though I protect you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) asks: So want to learn about walking on water?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Sure! I would like to learn.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: And protection would be great!
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Alright come.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Alright.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: So first step..
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Breathe in and out.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Like playing the flute?
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Something like that.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Okay, in and out. Easy enough!
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Slowy..
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Take ya time.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: In...... Out...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) breathes in and out. He then focuses the little energy he had and generates small chakra from his feet.<font color = white>&#34;Now try to hardness your energy. Focus Asuno focus...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) closed her eyes and replicated what Soichiro was demostrating. The silence was loud and she could hear the leaves twirling in the background. <font color = white>&#34;Focusing...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) help&#39;s her by watching her around. He then get&#39;s into the next step.<font color = white>&#34;Now to activate your chakra you must build it up from your body. Think about water alway&#39;s flowing. Breathe in and out and then you should feel it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Soichiro(The white haired teen.-Sora802) OOCs: (just got food sorry if rp slow
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) opens a eye, <font color = white>&#34;My chakra?&#34;</font>
   She did not know if she possessed such.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll try.&#34;</font>

The next few minutes, almost an hour, is spent gathering this &#39;chakra&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: Feel the flow Asuno gather it from your body!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asuno(The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) OOCs: (i asked the admins for the basics, i will see when they respond.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I feel it.. I think,
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Soichiro(The white haired teen.-Sora802) OOCs: (mhm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) walk&#39;s toward&#39;s the water and infront with his hand&#39;s motioned to grab on.<font color = white>&#34;Now generate that feeling toward&#39;s your feet. Don&#39;t worry I hold your hand. I won&#39;t let you drown Asuno.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) attaches herself to Soichiro&#39;s hand and steps into the pond. However, she was not adept at the skill and quickly sanked into the bottomless pool. 

The teenager splashes. <font color = white>&#34;G&#39;ak!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) would be worried. However it was time to courage Asuno. He would carry her out the water and sighed. It seemed she needed more time to learn.<font color = white>&#34;I think that was too soon. You know when you play the flute there&#39;s a melody. Think about playing the flute but using your chakra gracefully.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) groans while exitting the pond. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah.. I get it a little. Lets call it for the day. I need to get back to the stand. Thanks for the lessons, Soichiro-San!&#34;</font>

The girl runs off, wet and laughing. Today wasn&#39;t the day.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Oh. Okay.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: See ya later!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) completes a light stretch while looking around.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Bright out today...
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Hm. New clothes?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: You like?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I recently purchased a spot in the newsletter. We should receieve an advertisment soon.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I do. A newsletter? Maybe we can spread the word of this place to the two villages.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Exactly! That is what I am trying to do. But the promoters are awfully slow.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Response times... are insufferable.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Hm. I wonder if the inn is ready.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) leans against the smithing machine. <font color = white>&#34;Doubt it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) waves Asuno off the equipment.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll get your clothes dirty.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Akihabara isn't what it once was, but that doesn't mean we can't return to our golden age.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) straightens up. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</font>

With one look, the blonde could see the coal stain that manifested on their white robe. <font color = white>&#34;G&#39;ah..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: In time.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I'm sure we'll get a few visitors.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: We need more stalls.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Perhaps a stage for you.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Maybe. But, we'll let them see our new stalls as an expansion. If we show them everything from the start- they will have no reason to come back.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Akihabara needs something that no one else has. What do shinobi like?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I don't know. I have never met a shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: ...Neither have I.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ogura, Junji(The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) OOCs: (give me weapons to sell, tyvm. Disable craftsman for the villages so they are forced to come here)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asuno(The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) OOCs: (HELP US! -Sakura scream-)
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Hm. Once people arrive I'll need a hand running the shop. Interested?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Yep, that works. I want to work on selling my first edition plushie-dolls.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Plushies?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Mhm, mhm. I've been working on them. I will make one out of the first visitor that ask. It'll be rare.

His gaze would then turn toward the fellow merchants, still seemingly doing business. though they apparently lacked in clients.

<font color = white>&#34;You are still at it young man.&#34;</font> he descents from his ride, moving closer the the duo <font color = white>&#34;I just came back from Iwagakure. Kids there got some pocket change to spend.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: You've been traveling?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Vast lands..
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Keh keh.. what merchant doesn't travel? Seems like you still have a lot to learn..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) touches ground in new lands.
  <font color = white>&#34;Looks like we might be here.&#34;</font> He said, a little obliviously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) pats the table and smiles at the group. <font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Akihabara.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) frowns, staring at the caravan then back to the old man.

<font color = white>&#34;You should have taken Asuno with you. She&#39;s got the product to sell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Wagon (The old man's wagon-) would neigh while looking down at the nearby kids</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) peered from the back of the wagon suspiciously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Mhm.. you both weren't around. Beside, that old fox Yuu was in Iwagakure as well
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (holy shit it worked)
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Yuu?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: We made it! By the way. I am Hana, my lavender haired friend.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm Fubuki, nice to meet you, you seem cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to the horse through his peripherals only to then face it completely. His eyes take on the ether bound haze that'd become their signature and he seemed to look deep into the animals soul.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks to the creaky wagon for a moment before walking around and observing the area.
  <font color = white>&#34;Hey there, I&#39;m Yurei of the Mugen family.&#34;</font> He announced to them all as to not be a stranger.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: My name is A'suno. Shall I play my favorite tune for you?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Let's hear it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Can we make song requests?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) sighs, realizing that the youth of this day did not remember the names of the elderly..
<font color = white>&#34;Old merchant, like me, but not as good looking keh keh..&#34;</font> he shrugs, before casting his eyes to the side.. barely managing to see the figure of the kids.

<font color = white>&#34;You got clients, so I&#39;ll let you do your thing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Ashame the inn is closed.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: You cannot. My music is played from the heart. Allow me to play you.. 'Entry to Heaven'.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Ummm.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) watches the animal walk of and in that steps are made to follow it..
All the way up to the old man, in which his daydream like trance is broken.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) tilts her head in amusement. <font color = white>&#34;Are you trying to send us to heaven? Or are you sending yourself?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Where do you darlings hail from?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: We're from Iwagakure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Wagon (The old man's wagon-) looks down on the aloof aspirant with his prideful onyx orbs. Was this a staredown?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) asks: What's wrong Donut?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Are you from here?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) yells: Welcome to Akihabara, Jewel of Land!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ogura, Junji(The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) OOCs: (of the*
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Thanks for the welcome. Are you a merchant?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Junji Ogura, craftsman. This is my forge.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) just now noticed there were fireworks.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...&#34;</font> She felt a swelling of emotion watching them color the sky.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen for slightly as the horse looked down upon him. It was a strong animal, but he wondered what laid past it's strength. He understood everything has a story.
   As his line of sight hones in directly on the onyx orbs he saught to look within them.

                 What was it that the horse's soul saught to say?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I never seen anything like it up close.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately ran up to the merchant upon hearing he was a craftsman.

<font color = white>&#34;Excuse me, do you sell katanas?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) wonders to himself whether he should have shared that or not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) approaches the forge. Her eyes beeming with excitement.

 - <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Junji.&#34;</font> Her eyes danced around whatever he was selling.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: At the moment, no. Are all of you shinobi?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Not yet.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) got on her knees and slammed the ground before getting up and sighing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Academy students...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Ouch...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I can't but a katana anywhere...my life sucks.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Could you possibly commission one?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Academy students? Out here, alone?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I certainly can.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) follows the gaze of his donkey up to the figure of the aloof kid.
<font color = white>&#34;Mhm? What&#39;s wrong lad? Want to pet Donut?&#34;</font> he asks, patting the defiant muzzle of the donkey with ease <font color = white>&#34;Give it a try, though Donut can be a bit feisty, so be careful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, we're not very smart, but I'm desperate for a weapon.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: How much would it cost to comission a katana?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: If I ever need anything I know where to go.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: This is quite a spot.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) As she stepped forward, she inhaled deeply, savoring the fresh scent of the group and the gentle caress of the breeze. While closing her eyes, Asuno immersed herself in the silence of the surroundings, feeling at one with nature. 
Suddenly, she reached for her flute and brought it to her lips. 
     <font color = white>&#34;...!&#34;</font> 
As the first notes flowed from her instrument, a melody filled the air, weaving through the trees and dancing across the rippling current. The sound harmonized with the peaceful ambiance, creating a magical tune that spoke straight to the heart. With every careful touch of her fingers on the flute, the girl breathed life into the scene, calling all who listened into a nod. The music resonated with joy. 

                              [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4z5kntXAA] 

<font color = white>&#34;..this tune, &#39;The Bridge&#39; Entry to Heaven,&#34;</font> she recites while putting the flute away.

<font color = white>&#34;Not bad huh?&#34;</font>
      <font color = white>&#34;But anyways, lets get to the real reason you&#39;re here. I&#39;m selling one-of-one plushie items and I need someone to base my first design off of. Would anyone like to be the test dummy? It&#39;ll be free.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) squinted.

<font color = white>&#34;Why couldn&#39;t we be alone? We all serve the shogun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: It can't be to much.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Don't jinx it...please...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Cool'
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: A custom Ogura blade is quite expensive.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) yells: Oh wow this place is pretty cool!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Uh...what do I get with three hundred ryo?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) turned his head toward the old man momentarily while maintaining eyes contact with the horse before he&#39;d inevitably turn his head backforward and inch closer toward the large mammal.
           
     <font color = white>&#34;Donut..&#34;</font>
      <font color = white>&#34;Is that your name?&#34;</font>, he asked calmly as he approached the animal.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Wait, you're going to make a doll out of someone?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I guess I could do it. My little sister might like that...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Yes. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Should I come to the other side of the counter?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana watched Asuno play her flute, the melody drifting through the air. She appreciated the technical skill, but the music felt slow and needed more emotional depth. Kohana was more drawn to the vibrant, soulful energy of R&amp;B, a genre that resonated deeply with her spirit.

As Asuno finished and introduced her plushie project, Kohana smiled politely, though her mind was still on the music. <font color = white>&#34;Not bad,&#34;</font> she replied diplomatically. <font color = white>&#34;But honestly, the tune was a bit too slow for my taste. I&#39;m more of a rhythm and soul person. Still, I&#39;m curious about your plushie project. What kind of design are you thinking about?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eyes widen with excitement as he saw many people lined up. Could this be a ninja wonder-land? As he continued to move around, he'd take note of the uniform worn by the strangers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I won't be selling anything today, but I can take orders.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Asuno on the other hand, will be.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: The design'll be made from a person here today, if there is more than one person that is interested, then we will have to play a game to find out who will be chosen.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: So this is Akihabara?..
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: What can I order with three hundred ryo? It's all I have after all. I'm looking for a blade.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (how tf does a donkey sound
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: ...This is the land of Akihabara?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (hee haw?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: So for a basic full tang katana. Can we say what amount of ryo is an acceptable fee?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Can I order 'sum 'rmor for two 'hunnit?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Wagon (The old man's wagon-) stomps the ground with his proud hooves, leaving deep marks on dirt.
Were it not for his owner's hand he might have already kicked the boy in the face.

"<i>AGGRESSIVE DONKEY SOUNDS</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) was curious what he'd could request here in the distant land.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: I guess I'll wait my turn... but I could definately use some senbons.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Don't be silly boy.. why are you trying to talk to a donkey? Donut might be smart, but he can't speak..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I'm afraid you children don't have enough for katanas or armor.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) moved towards the part of the table with the senbons on display.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm....
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Imagine approaching a rabid animal.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) sighed kinda disappointed, but she expected it. <font color = white>&#34;Alright then, at least gimme a goal - how much will I need in the future?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: An estimate works.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: A number would be nice, yes.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: If you're interested in purchasing a Ogura original, please tell me your name and what weapon you wish to have made.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: How much for a kuai?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes a moment to really experience the music. As she was of foreign origin, her music style was different than anything that had influenced him locally.
  It was peaceful, a meditation, and thought-provoking. There was a certain free essence to it.

   Yurei thought that it was beautiful, and so he stared at the young woman a bit slack-jawed.

  <font color = white>&#34;If you want me as a doll, I could help.&#34;</font> The Mugen said, blushing at her talents!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) makes a mental note on the composed girl. No one offends his donkey without getting economic sanctions..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: One-thousand for a katana.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned toward the thoughtful, composed girl who had also offered to be used as inspiration.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t back down.&#34;</font> She asserted. <font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll have to play whatever game A&#39;suno decides upon.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm Fubuki, I want a katana - one day I'll return with 700 more ryo and order it from you.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: ...!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Indeed. Or you can work in the mines for three years.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen ever so slightly as he stops just a few inches out of the donkie&#39;s hoof range.
     <font color = white>&#34;...Are-&#34;</font> - He looks at the old man. <font color = white>&#34;Would you say that this Donkey is a partner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Fubuki so you have 300?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I do yes.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: We will have to play indeed. Lets get away from the crowd. If you're interested in being a contestant for the very first edition of my plushies. Please follow me a bit north. I will then detail how the game will work.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Partner? He is my traveling partner..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh.. I wonder if Kaido would want somethin..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I suggest you all follow Asuno.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: How much for senbon kind sir?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) hopes that the kid didn't mean any other deranged form of partner.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) pumps a fist into the air.
  <font color = white>&#34;A&#39;right.&#34;</font> He smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I will have prices for weapons and more by the time you all become shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: For now, the forge is closed. I will accept orders, though.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Mhm.. Donut would be my employee.. right.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Hoshino Kohana handed Fubuki 200 ryo with a playful smile. <font color = white>&#34;Here, take this. It&#39;s because we match in hair color,&#34;</font> she said, her eyes twinkling with mischief. <font color = white>&#34;Who knows, we might have some kind of blood ties,&#34;</font> she added with a light-hearted laugh, enjoying the moment. <font color = white>&#34;Consider it a gift from one lavender-haired friend to another.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Begins to scratch their head,just wondring who are these people</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: You mean tha' loser who called me fat?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Fubuki, I'll mark you down for a katana.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks down to the soil in thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you sell Kunais.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: Now to raise 500 more ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: You don't listen very well, do you?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Will we have permits to travel to these lands?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Also can you save and order for me? One Kunai and 10 senbons?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) followed A'suno.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Your name?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: ... Ah... My name is Afro
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I'll wait four more minutes to be sure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Did you ask them?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) needed a moment to realize she suddenly got a bunch of money from her new friend. <font color = white>&#34;Wait are you sure about this?!&#34;</font> then quickly she had to turn around to talk to the blacksmith, she was very overwhelmed by all of these things going on. <font color = white>&#34;O-okay then! I &#39;unno exactly when I&#39;ll pay you back but I&#39;ll come back and pay full price! Thank you mister!&#34;</font> she bowed towards Junji before looking at Hana again. <font color = white>&#34;Okay, I owe you one big time. I won&#39;t forget this. Now, are we going to check out that game?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Forgive me merchant, what might I refer you as?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) looks to the side, as his very poor hearing still managed to catch some of the discussion.
<font color = white>&#34;Keh keh.. young man. I already told them about the supply chain issues. But do you think kids that still smell of milk can understand?&#34;</font> he chuckles</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Junji Ogura.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I have you marked down for the kunai and senbon.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Who? Donut? I don't need to ask, this bad boy follows me wherever I go
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: One of you spoke about a game correct?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) ignored the manner as to which the merchant was flamboyant, and offer a smile. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Junji of the Ogura family. I look forward to our next encounter.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hrnnn
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Two minutes left.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) nods! <font color = white>&#34;Very sure! My father used a katana. I remember how much it meant to him. And I think I will pass on the game. I&#39;m suddenly feeling a daze.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Is it free one?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: But goodluck!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Your father is very cool. Uh, are you okay though?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: How'd you get one?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I am fine. Just need a wee nap.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Okay then. To be honest I'm kinda tired from traveling too..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So who do I talk to about gettin' some shuriken sets and a kunai?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i just remember i gotta leave irl in less than an hour lol)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) blinks a few times a he seems to find some contentment in conversation. <font color = white>&#34;I see.&#34;</font>
He states before bowing to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you for the insight.&#34;</font>

With that he wanders off to find his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Yurei.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Weird kid. But at least he got manners..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Hey mista', what's on the menu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) points to himself when hearing the mention of weapons.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Yeah, Gramps. What's on tha' menu?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm going to buy that man's horse.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: How would the old man react to you bringing a horse home?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks toward the ground in thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I suppose you're right.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...buying their horse will be very wrong.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shakes his head. <font color = white>&#34;This old man hasn&#39;t brought anything beside..&#34;</font> he rummages through his pockets <font color = white>&#34;..two sticks worth of joints. But I doubt kids like you would be interested.&#34;</font> he shrugs, as he rolls a cig for himself.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Well shiit'
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: We don't have them in stock yet, old man.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: No one gon' know, 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to the male. <font color = white>&#34;...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It's not a horse. It's a donkey.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yells: Tsk-tsk.. kids these days.. I am a moral merchant! Shoo!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Yes'suh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) chuckles, stepping back and munching on his bag of Burritos</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So yer' a merchant that doesn't have anything to sell?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) tucks the flute into her back pocket in exchange for a pair of white dice. 
       <font color = white>&#34;This is a game I learned as a child and I used it to determine who would have leftovers between me and my late brother.&#34;</font>

The tone was upbeat despite the tragic news. 

<font color = white>&#34;The game is simple and the winner will model and recieve the very first edition of my plushie collection for free. I&#39;ll start to sell them afterwards, and that is assuming you make enough of a name for yourself to earn one.&#34;</font>

The dice are thrown into the center for the group to expect. The numbers were digital-and advanced. <font color = white>&#34;The game is called &#39;200&#39;. Everyone will roll the dice using &#39;200&#39;. The number you get will act as your next roll number, and it could range from 199-to-1, it all depends on your luck.&#34;</font>

With a soft laugh, she concludes. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll keep rolling &#39;your&#39; lowest number until you get to &#39;1&#39;. The last person to hit &#39;1&#39; will be the winner. Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Maybe we should be talkin' to that one over there.. I think they said their name was Junji or somethin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shooes away the willful kid as he turns his attention to Ogura <font color = white>&#34;You are correct young man. The supply chain won&#39;t be fixed for a couple of months still.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: inspect*
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'm a girl..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sorry to hear that flute girl..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It's okay, that is a story for another time.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But alright...guess i will play,i already know im gonna lose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her attention back to A&#39;suno, and listened. As she started to describe the game, the smaller, blue-haired, angry-looking girl recognized it as the same game that other children had been playing near the arena. It even had the same name. She wondered if it spread from Akihabara, or if it had just spread to Akihabara. Either way, she was ready to play.

<font color = white>&#34;Prepare to lose, Yurei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah, right
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Hey, mista'
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's hope this one isn't just for show..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the explanation of the game.
 <font color = white>&#34;Sounds like it&#39;s based on a roll of the dice.&#34;</font> Therefore in his mind, if he lost, it was only fate.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got this. Their gonna be sowing Mugen dolls until their fingers bleed. Ehahaha.&#34;</font> He laughed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares at the plump youth for a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t sell armor in your size, yet.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I look forward to the challenge, "Mugen".
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: A duel... of the fates.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: If you're ready, you guys can circle up and start.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who is going first?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I will.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Come closer.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: The forge isn't open at the moment, but I can take orders.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) ponders for a moment. <i><font color = white>&#34;Luck..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I will join.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I will await the winner. You'll have to do some poses for me though. I do hope the winner isn't camera shy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) reached into her pocket--

<font color = white>&#34;Actually, I don&#39;t have a dice. Can I borrow one, A&#39;suno?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So how's it work? We place an order an' then you come to our village to deliver?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) sweatdrops</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) flips a pair of cubes in the girl&#39;s direction. <font color = white>&#34;Here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: We can start at Shuye then work ourselves clockwise.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I can come to you or you can come to me. Either works.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I just need a name and what you need.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) caught the cubes and then, with a twirl, unleashed them onto the ground between them!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Terrible...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: I've seen worse! Good roll!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will grab the dice and roll</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks to Yurei, since it seemed they'd be going counter clockwise.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Akimichi, huh? I think our innkeeper is one of those.

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: But I heard you made a lot of money and started making plushies.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: That's cool.

<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I wouldn't say a lot...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: But, I think it's a good start. You want to come with me to Ame to drop off this Plushie when I finish?

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Sure I would love too.

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: Mhm I will do my best!
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: For now, I need to work on my plushie. I took some photos of the guy so it should not take me very long to thread the doll.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) asks: Hm... how long does it take to make?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Maybe thirty or fourty minutes.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Maybe I can meet the shogun one day..
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: But that's another thing. I wonder who lead's the guild here.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Shogun huh?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: I've never met him. What do you think he is like?

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: The most powerful man alive..
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Cool and the strongest swordsmen.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Doesn't sound all that strong to me if he is only using a sword, Soichiro-San.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: I mean he has more authority then them village leaders!
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Really?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: I'm clueless on those things!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) sat down on the edge of the stairs leading to the main floor of the blacksmith. Bored green eyes darted between the two at th counter- before a hand that had been digging around in a bag found the rice ball snacks and popped one after another into her mouth.

After chewing for a long moment she finally said, <font color = white>&#34;They haven&#39;t finished the new floors of the Inn yet, it&#39;s just an absolute mess in there.&#34;</font> The words were a bit muffled from the addition of another rice ball. But non-the-less made sense.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) Her attention is immediately captured by the sound of chewing, which she finds dreadful. It resonates in her ears like a low-battery fire alarm, causing discomforting screech in her ears. Asuno slowly turns her head to locate the source of the noise, and her eyes land on a woman eating a riceball.

Asuno&#39;s mind is flooded with a series of questions, like- 
                         Where is the Inn located? 
                              And why was it a mess?

The internal conversation is stomached like the riceballs and digested into an aloof expression on the blonde&#39;s face. She engaged, not by asking about the Inn, but instead.. 
     
       
                            <font color = white>&#34;Why are you chewing so loud..!&#34;</font>



The words blurt out unconsciously, a pet peeve having arose.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) The chewing stopped for all of .5 seconds, before something that looked round but this time made out of cake was placed in the womans mouth.
<font color = white>&#34;Not sure, this is just how I chew, never really gave it much thought.&#34;</font>

A smirk- not unlike that of the cat who spilled the milk settled on her lips as she brushed crumbs from her fingers.
<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you at the Inn before- actually lots of new faces I haven&#39;t seen before. I&#39;m Cholynn operator and proprietor of the Stone and River.&#34;</font>

This was followed by a chuckle as the bag was set to the side, <font color = white>&#34;Are you hungry? I bet I could whip up a snack or three on that furnace back there!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) was thinking of what to say before looking at the innkeeper.<font color = white>&#34;How long will it take? It can&#39;t be that bad.&#34;</font> After thinking about how he would tell Asuno he would basically explain in his own piece.<font color = white>&#34; Well the shogun is like a saviour. I heard he saved  Iwa once and granted them gifts. He lives here as our leader and guardian. That&#39;s what my dad told me.&#34;</font>

After that he sweat&#39;s.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Soichiro(The white haired teen.-Sora802) OOCs: (They need to make a aki doc cuz jeez..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I guess.. I could eat something.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: Food!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802)  eye's widen. He could not say no to food.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) pushed herself off the ground and eyed the furnace, making her way over to where the water was she procured a pot out of the bag she carried, it was large, and seemed to clank and rattle. 
 <font color = white>&#34;Noodles would be the best thing I think, I didn&#39;t bring much else besides some rice and random snacks, oh and dried fish.&#34;</font>

Sticking her head farther down into the bag, <font color = white>&#34;I bet there is an egg in here...&#34;</font>

The bag is rummaged in as the water starts to boil, the noddles are added before the egg and what looks to be a few dried veggies.
 <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;ll be good! Not my -best- but good enough for spur of the moment.&#34;</font>

Bowls were found in the bag and set to the side before being filled with the noodles, broth, egg and- carrots and that does look like green onion.
<font color = white>&#34;Ta-da! Fantasitc, supurb and good too.&#34;</font>

The noodles were carried over to the two at the front desk first, and set down gently, before she wandered back to get her own.

Onyx chopsticks were removed from her bag as she took a deep breath.
 <font color = white>&#34;Any business today?&#34;</font>

A large slurp of noodles was taken as she waited.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) --Snnnaaap--

The chopsticks are torn apart, and the sound of splinters, popping in half, sing loudly in the background. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you!&#34;</font>

Despite having chopsticks, she slups the fluid and quenches her thirst. Afterwards, she digs in. <font color = white>&#34;Somewhat. I have a plushie design that I have to complete and take to Amegakure.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;My very first plushie. It&#39;ll be rare and designed after the individual who won my contest today.&#34;</font>

She slups the noodles again. <font color = white>&#34;I need to have it finished by tomorrow. Then me and Soichiro-San will travel and deliver the item to the winner. Good marketing, I hope!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0cd987>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) slupped up a few more noodles, <font color = white>&#34;Oh a trip to one of the villages sounds neat. And good marketing indeed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) started to eat like a  mad man.<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for the food.&#34;</font> Having no manner&#39;s like usual he continued to eat like crazy he nod&#39;s at the question.<font color = white>&#34;Mhm and I will protect her while we get there. Just incase of course!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
