<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) 's eyelashes rose revealing a terryfing array of melted gold laid aggressively amongst his irises. With it, his eyes shrunk, further fueling any sense of discomfort one may have had with his brief antics.

The slimmer Akimichi's smile definitely confirmed that she was speaking to him--which, kind of sort of dissolved any semblance he had of remaining patient and obtuse.

Stumbling to his feet, the boy bowed furiously, seemingly attempting to display some sense of apolgy, though after he was finished bowing....
His eyes continued to burn hellfire within the group, definitely seems like something he can't discourage on his own.

<font color = white>&#34;Like what?&#34;</font> She asked, confused. There&#39;s no apology, which might have been odd-- or at least a little confrontational. <font color = white>&#34;You look okay to me.&#34;</font> She would then, finally, turn her attention on the boy between them since it had been pointed out by the other girl.

She would move away from the Akimichi, then. As a nearly-fully-fledged-rookie-ninja, jumping the distance of the arena&#39;s edges was no trouble at all! She landed next to him softly. Her eyes leveled on him, searching to meet with his own. Then she smiled disarmingly, for the first time since she&#39;d shown up.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept locking eyes with her little brother. He almost sounded feral, the way he talked. Dripping with emotion, but trying to claw it back. Screaming, but barely above a whisper. Nothing new. An everyday struggle. A jade was a jade, no matter how much settled upon it&#39;s surface. It could always be cut to a finer edge. A brilliant luster. What it was meant to be. Shuye is left to decide whether an aplogy is even necessary, as she doubted others around here would be able to translate him.

When she noticed the heavy breathing boy behind him, Shuye&#39;s reaction is subtle but intentional. She reached out to her younger brother and grasped his hand firmly; almost maternally, rather than sisterly. She pulled him gently toward her, lest he turn around and notice how close the other boy was now.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course, dìdì.&#34;</font> She finally answered. <font color = white>&#34;Choko, my brother didn&#39;t mean to stare.

She quickly made her way to a bench to lie upon it, where she lazily gazed up at the clouds until sleep took her for the day...</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) glanced at her side only to spot somebody else that wasn&#39;t sleeping - she was going to wave at her until she notticed the person going back to sleep, sighing a bit disappointed before looking back at Chobina once more.

<font color = white>&#34;Fubuki.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (night night
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Fubuki it is! So tell me about yourself, Fubuki?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Umh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) folded her arms and began thinking; what exactly could she even tell about herself?

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh, I dyed my hair. I guess that&#39;s cool. It&#39;s your turn now isn&#39;t it?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Oh! Do you want to play a game? Wait I didnt tell you about myself. Uh... I love art and I want to make games!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Games? Like what?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (noob question, is there a way to start a roleplay post without starting with my own name
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Like card games. I want to create a game with cool art simple gameplay. 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chobina(The chubby black girl-LionHunter) OOCs: (yes
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (how
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chobina(The chubby black girl-LionHunter) OOCs: Typing // before a roleplay with set it in third person narrative.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (ohh ty
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chobina(The chubby black girl-LionHunter) OOCs: (<3

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) placed her hands on her hips. <font color = white>&#34;Im 16 myself but that doesnt make it a children&#39;s card game! Its pretty competitive you know. And I will add some strategy in the mix.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hmm...fine. If you insist.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: But here is the game im thinking about for now. We will each ask each other 2 questions. You have to answer truth on one of them and a lie on the other. We have to decide which is which. Sounds fun?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I suppose it will do, very well.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Ok, Woudl you like me to be the asker first?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yes.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would think about what answer to ask. <font color = white>&#34;The first question. Why did you dye your hair?&#34;</font> She started off simple. The game could get very deep but that was up to the asker. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) jumped to the arena where Chobina was, folding her arms. She thought of the question for a while unsure whether to lie or say the truth before answering: <font color = white>&#34;Because I wanted to look cool.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Ok now you ask a question. We take turns!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Why do you want to make games?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (Are we supposed to click starting incentive?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chobina(The chubby black girl-LionHunter) OOCs: (nope
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (oh so the hidden traitt is the core u get, dope
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) thought about this for another pause.  She parted her lips to speak a suprising answer. <font color = white>&#34;I want to be a trailblazer. Do something that noone has done before. Within a world such as this, this can be alittle safe haven a dim light in the sea of darkness as it were. Why stick to the status quo when you can make something wholely yourself?&#34;</font>

That was the answer to her question. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hmm. Is that also your question or rhetorical?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: That is my answer.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Pretty poetic right?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah. I dunno what being a trailblazer is but you have your priorities set so, dope.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Being a trail blazer is is someone that takes a path noone has taken.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#701f1f>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) was holding a book..quietly reading it to herself as she walked into the area. She had lightly glanced up noticing some people was asleep and some was awake. Only one thing that stood out was her large red afro.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Why do you want to look cool? 
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: But in a village as big as this don't you think people have taken a lot of steps everywhere?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh, uh. Because, if I become famous one day I'd rather look cool.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Its a bit deeper than that. 
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Oh, I'm not good with deep stuff. Also it's my turn to ask you stuff right?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Its not following a physical path. More so following a path that noone has taken. Everyone wants to be a fighter, a medic, a chuunin, jounin, kage...But noone would ever want to be a game creater. A master of fun and fancy.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Mhm your turn to ask me a question.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched the back of her head while trying to understand all of that. She was too simply to get a concept like that.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Kay...well, aren&#39;t you training to be a shinobi too? Or are you just gonna be a game maker?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would answer with just as much bluster as the previous ask. <font color = white>&#34;Im training to be both. a game master and a shinobi. One will be a hobby and the other will be a job. The end goal is the same. I want to have fun and this is how I will achieve it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#701f1f>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Flipped through a page, before yawning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hmm...well, one lie and one truth. The first answer is a lie and this last one is true, did I get it right?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) claps her hands together. <font color = white>&#34;5 billion points. You got it right. Good sleuthing.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) nodded, trying to hide how proud she felt over a silly game. A small smile escaped her. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m just that good. Your turn to guess.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I believe your first answer is a lie as well.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nope. The other way around actually.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Oh really?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I like this hair color but I don't wanna look cool simply for being famous; I don't want to be famous at all.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: So you dont want to be cool?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: So why change your hair color?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I do wanna be cool, that's why I changed my hair color. Just not famous.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: After all aren't we supposed to be like, sneaky ninjas or something?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh im confusing myself. Silly me
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have lost. Negative five billion points it is.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: I mean... if you want to be a guess. Do you see me sneaking anywhere?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shrugged. <font color = white>&#34;Maybe, with training.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#701f1f>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times, before flipping through the page not understanding the meaning to the setence..before blinking once more.. choosing to ingore it and close her book before starting to lean down and started to do push ups, pushing herself up and down.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Im a bit too big for that
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) could see someone on the far side of her vision, it caught her attention since she suddenly began to do push ups. Fubuki waved at her. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, need help with training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#701f1f>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Shifted her eyes up, as she was doing her excerises.. <font color = white>&#34;No.&#34;</font> That is what she said at first.. then spoke afterwards. <font color = white>&#34;I am okay, I don&#39;t need help.&#34;</font> She groaned..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh hey
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Hello

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Utsuwa, Himeki
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: But you can call me hime!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Chobina Akimichi, but you can call me Bina! Its nice to meet you Hime.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Heya, Bina. Oooh a Akimichi one of the cool clans!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Mhm, Mhm~
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Uh, what do Akimichi do?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: What do you mean what do we do?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Don't clans do special stuff?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh yea! We have something others cant do.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Such as? 'Cuz I have no idea.
