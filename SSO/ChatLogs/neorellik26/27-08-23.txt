<br><font color=green>*Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Tsk. Soul less preys. All asleep.
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) stretches his arms back behind his head in boredom. None of the preys were responding and no other preys came about.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) rubbed the side of his face, with one finger for a moment. Clearly the male wasn't talking to him cause he wasn't any type of prey as such he didn't go out his way to respond to the person. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) Ishikamaru's venture across Amegakure wasn't as fruitful as he thought it'd be. Truthfully, he was expecting to see utter chaos -- maybe due to his chaotic natureat heart. Though stoic in the visage, the lad tended to ponder on the idea of--

Nevermind.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nods his head as he points at all three standing around with full confidence. What else could they be if not prey?

<font color = white>&#34;Uh huh! One prey, two prey, three prey!&#34;</font> He sighed as he shook his head momentarily after, <font color = white>&#34;Maybe the prey don&#39;t know they&#39;re prey...&#34;</font> A whisper barely audible.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) blinked, <font color = white>&#34;oi.. who&#39;re you calling prey?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I think he was talking to you. &#34;</font> Because he already know the male wouldn&#39;t be speaking about him like that clearly.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) shook his head as he listened to both of them. One was blind and the other wasn&#39;t the smartest.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahh... the preys are... vulnerable. It&#39;s okay! You&#39;re safe with me, preys.&#34;</font>

He nodded his head as he looked at both of them.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) simply glared at the dress-wearing smelly man. A slow shake of his head is given from Ishikamaru toward their rebuttal. Nothing else was said for the time being.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) Nodding to each as they introduced themselves he pulled out three scrolls and handed them to each student. He then took a fourth one out and revealed the information inside it.

<font color = white>&#34;These are signup scrolls. Please fill these out and have your parents sign them then bring them back. If you do not have parents then sign the second line that states so.&#34;</font>

He points to each section

<font color = white>&#34;The first section is simple. Just your name, age, eye color basic descriptors. The second section goes over what you will be doing while at the academy. The third section is a waiver that states any harm recieved during training courses is not to be used against the academy. The fourth section states that this course is made to raise shinobi of the village and what that entails.&#34;</font>

He smiles once again and rolls the scroll up.

<font color = white>&#34;Feel free to fill these out in your spare time but know that school starts soon so don&#39;t take too long.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nods his head as he grabs scroll from the instructor. He could read just enough but it&#39;s not like he truly understood what many of it meant, but he was told enough.

<font color = white>&#34;Great! Signing up!&#34;</font> He bit his forefinger before writing his information down on the scroll. Just the basics as asked.

Name: Yoru
Age: 12
Doing: Learning!

He held his hand out for Shion to grab it back.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) takes the scrolls and nods.
<font color = white>&#34;Thanks.&#34;</font> he said.

<br><font color=green>*Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) says: I can start teaching as soon as I have students but I believe the year starts sometime later today. I would say try to get the l scroll signed in the next 6 hours.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) went ahead and begin to fill out the paperwork, it was quite simple as the man had stated. 

-Yoshimitsu, 15.- 

Took him a bit to think over the doing part, was it asking him what he wanted to train in? He would stop and ask.

<font color = white>&#34;Umm, for this doing part is like what we aiming to learn?&#34;</font> He asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shiroimu, Shion(The warm man-Limb) OOCs: (also I am a chunin)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) would give a nod before going back to fill it in.

-Taijutsu/Kenjutsu-

The male would finish up with how he looks and then sign his name. After which he would turn the paper in.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) takes the scroll from yoru and smiles.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) tosses the scroll back to the chuunin. If he had paid attention, he would have noticed Tajin did not bring out any writing utensils thus leaving the scroll blank.

<font color = white>&#34;Yokai, Tajin. Twelve years old and I plan doing whatever is needed most of in the village.

<font color = white>&#34;Right.&#34;</font>

He looks to the new potential student.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Prey! Have you been training?!
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) says: I'm training as we speak. Interesting chakra you got there, too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looks completely confused at the response. How was that training... and how could he see his chakra? He couldn&#39;t even see his own chakra. Was this a weakness?

<font color = white>&#34;Liar! You aren&#39;t training!... Right?&#34;</font> Maybe the kid was lying... </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Is he still calling people, prey?
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: Yea, I think he was dropped on his head as a baby.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Ah! You were saying that to me?!
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: You know they say, when that happens people come out a bit crazy.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I wasn't dropped! Prey is prey!
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Why do you call people, prey?

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Yoru kinda... dum dum)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Prey is prey?

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (tai adept said sreq acrobat)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Prey are those who are not at the top of the food chain!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Everyone is prey! Except us!
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: And you are...at the top of the food chain?
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Who is us?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) kept his eyes closed while Yoru spoke, <font color = white>&#34;I am definitely training. I can see everyone here right now -- without my eyes. And I&#39;m practicing how to expand that ability.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) laughs as he puts his hands on his hips and strikes a pose. His family was pretty well known!

<font color = white>&#34;Not me, but my family!&#34;</font> He turned a few times to give a good view of his... fairly normal looks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) just stares at Yoru, his eyes blinking a few times. He would adjust his mask to sit more comfortably on his nose.

<font color = white>&#34;I have no clue what you are talking about?&#34;</font>, he says, before turning his attention to Ishi.

He would hold a few fingers behind his back. 

<font color = white>&#34;How many fingers am I holding up?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (ironically very nara-esque)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) slowly removed his hands from his hips from shock. One eyebrow raised. Surely he was lying? Who didn&#39;t know of his family? Granted he didn&#39;t have too many obvious features!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re... joking... right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) ponders on it for a while before speaking up.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, he is someone who using his family to act like he is strong&#34;</font> He said with a snap of his finger as if he guessed it right.

<font color = white>&#34;I think that is why, he talks like that. Makes sense now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: I-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) took emotional damage as he paused in shock. The youth wasn&#39;t wrong. He himself wasn&#39;t strong yet... at least not by most people standards... He was just a fledgling, no not even a fledglng yet.

<font color = white>&#34;Y-you&#39;re... wrong! I&#39;m...&#34;</font> his voice got quieter near the end and started to trail off. How would he even respond to such a response? </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) sighed out. <font color = white>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter how much fingers you have up. As long as I know where you are at all times.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: So when do we start class?
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That went well.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (You found it>)
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) asks: Found the mines?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (ye kinda gotta glitch a part of the map. Warpers are iffy.)
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That I did. Met the client and now I have some ryo. I think I will go and purchase a knife with all this talk of crime.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled as he was spot on but no point in trashing someone for no real reason .
<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure you will get strong as time goes on.&#34;</font> He said leaving at that, with a bit of a smirk on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nodded spiritless. He wanted to be strong now! Not later...

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah... later on...&#34;</font> he sighed</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) supressed a yawn with the long sleeve of their kimono. <font color = white>&#34;Welll for now I will turn in.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) returned before heading to sleep. They knew better than most....proper protection came in numbers.

<font color = white>&#34;Here you are children. Play with these, someone must be responsible around here.&#34;</font> a laugh escaped from the bandaged mouth as they dumped several spinning stars with sharpened edges out</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Suichi (The uncouth youth-DontScissorWithTarps) says: Thank you friend
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) accepting the gift with a nod, pocketing it soon after.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5b5b84>Suichi (The uncouth youth-DontScissorWithTarps) puts the spinning star in his pocket.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) took the sharp star and put it away <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not a child..&#34;</font> He while still taking the gift anyways. No hint of shame.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: it is not much. But if crime really is bad in the big village then that should at least discourage a common bandit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) kicks a rock down the street, stopping at the comotion with a pique in interest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) cheered up somewhat with the gift. Shiny weapons were a step closer to getting strong!

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks, prey!&#34;</font> He shoved them into his pants irresponsibily.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That placement wont end well I am sure....as a matter of fact if anyone inquires I did not arm you.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I should lie?
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That can be useful. We are Shinobi, such a thing is a skill. In any case I am off to rest. good day
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I'm not a shinobi yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: Oh, man he going to be telling.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (gn though)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (night xD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) peers at the cloth man, his facial mask obscuring the parts of his face that would relay any emotions. He stares at the shuriken on the ground, before slowling bending over to pick it up.

He examines it brilliant shine, his finger tracing the edges of the blade. A small speck of blood would begin to protrude from his finger, as the sharp edge sliced his soft flesh.

He would place the shuriken into his cowl pocket.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Ahhh... if only i had enhanced smell)

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I won't tell! I can keep secrets, prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) 's steps were measured and deliberate as she approached the gathering of children. Her gaze remained fixed ahead, her eyes sweeping over the scene without a glimmer of interest. The chatter of the kids was a distant murmur, a background noise that held no sway over her thoughts.

Her features remained unchanged, her face an unmoving mask, as she walked closer to the group. Their voices rose and fell in a rhythm that didn't penetrate her consciousness. Shizuku's expressionless stare remained focused, her mind untouched by their words.

She was lost in a thick train of thought. Her mind set on her father's words and what they meant for her as a young Shinobi of a prominent clan. When the crowd was nearby, she stopped and fixated her stare on the people near her.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) gave a slight nod to the male.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) Sticks a pinky up his nose digging for gold.
 <font color = white>&#34;WOAH! Really!? That means we can be best friends then!&#34;</font> He replies to the black haired youth.
 <font color = white>&#34;I want to learn too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) stood like a statue in place, her hands resting at her sides.

<font color = white>&#34;...I am to be in class on the first day. I have yet to see our instructors.&#34;</font> The girl mutters. Her left hand&#39;s index finger twitches as she casts her eyes between the kids talking.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) Removed a book from her pouch and quietly started to read it.

<font color = white>&#34;I have yet to see them as well.. &#34;</font> She had said flipping through a page on her small book.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I only saw him once! He came and went!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The kid&#39;s pinky flicks a bugger from out his nose then after, he rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

 <font color = white>&#34;Hehehe, yeah! My papa said you have to kill the prey, always!&#34;</font> He shouted. Spinning around on his foot facing the crimson-haired-girl, he gazes at her book. <font color = white>&#34;Ohhhh! Is that a reading paper!? Whatcha readin best friend!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: No! Kill other prey, protect our prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) would shrug his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;Best friends? yea yea, sure whatever.&#34;</font>He said not really paying mind to it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times at the term best friend, the girl blinked a few more times before speaking. <font color = white>&#34;Fuuijinjutsu.&#34;</font> She said rubbing the side of her nose for a moment before going back to her study.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Hello everyone.
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Hey
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Hello prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0099cc>Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) Turns her head to look in the smelly boys direction.

<font color = white>&#34;Prey?&#34;</font> She questions.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Not me. I'm not prey?
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Never mind.
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: I wanted to see if anyone would like to go fishing with me.
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Guess not.
<br><font color=green>*Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm I could go fishing with you if you want.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0099cc>Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) shrugs her shoulders as it seemed everyone was day dreaming. Working hard on their statue style stance it seemed. Kind of sucked but then she heard someone speak up.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh alright just follow me.&#34;</font> She said, looking over at the Crimson haired girl</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: Whaaaa!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) The lad came towards the group it seemed as though he&#39;s finally ran into some people within his village atleast people he actually notice.

After a back and forth yelling competition witht he gilly rock boy, hell look towards the guy giving a slight nod.

<font color = white>&#34;So What&#39;s your name?&#34;</font> He stated with his arms crossed.</font></font></font>

Though there are several new faces that I havent met yet it would seem.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
