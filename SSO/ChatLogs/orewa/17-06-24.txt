<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ccff>Hyuuga, Hisane (The ivory eye'd boy-Orewa) decides to take a breather from the daily challenge and just relax and admire the scenery. He starts to lose himself in his peaceful mindset and nods off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) moved his arms under neath his poncho, folding them as he watched on. Going two againstr one seemed as if it would do very little. Thus, opting to let Hana have her fun seemed more probable.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Why shall i stay quiet and watch if i don't like what i see.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Najiro, I'm trying to *help* you, but you don't see it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) One by one, her hands swung with those galavanting strides. Each audible step just gave a warning and reminder of the damage she was capable of inflicting. To step back was to delay the inevitable.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one making this harder on yourself&#34;</font> She calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would turn around, staring at the afro haird child as he seemingly ripped off a piece of cloth with his clan&#39;s crest on it. The masked figure didn&#39;t even move his arm upwards to take the cloth. Instead, he would look straight through the sole of the Uzumaki.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need a piece of cloth to summon you. If I find myself in need, I will take The Commander above a Student. Like I have said before...I am watching you all. Waiting to see which one of you, and only one, interests me the most. I would suggest, focusing on your training for the next year or so.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Now, for you Bill. What are the three main tools of a Shinobi? The most basic ones.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) looks down at her hands for a moment.
   <font color = white>&#34;Hm. Maybe this is one of those sayings, like-- <i>anything</i> is lethal in the hands of a shinobi,&#34;</font> she muses aloud. Confident in her findings, she plants her hands on her hips and definitively nods. <font color = white>&#34;Very cool.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Eeeeeasy.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Precisely that, my sharp-toothed gal!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) stood in front of Miss Botan, but their gaze shifted to the crimson-haired veteran and the task they gave them.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, Umm...Kunai, Shuriken and Log.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Log?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Huh.&#34;</font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: log isn't a tool..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Only a little though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) quickly moved to do as she had done before, and produced a singular shiny-metallic item from within her sleeve. This time? It was a Shuriken, a singular Shuriken - it wasn&#39;t much but it was still free.

She handed it over.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) once more moved to produce an item from her sleeve, and this time it was the last of the fundamental three. A singular, freshly sharpened, and steel-carbon infused Kunai.

   <font color = white>&#34;A Kunai,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

blinked.

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned.
