<font color = white>&#34;Well nice to officially meet you chief, names Himotachi, Sora, and this one is my brother Takuma.&#34;</font> they would point to the Ambitious one who had been a bit quiet till then.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what my boss would say to this...maybe I should wait for him?&#34;</font>

He would think while walking with his hands firmly placed at back of his head. Step by step he was slowly in front of the manor where he wonders what this group of people has gathered around for. In a friendly manner he smiles and joins them.

<font color = white>&#34;Erm...hello. I am Gosame and I am looking for someone to sign me up in the academy?&#34;</font>
