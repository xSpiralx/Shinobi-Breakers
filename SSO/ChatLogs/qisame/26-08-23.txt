At first, the Hyuuga seemed very supportive of the pinkette&#39;s endeavours- it was as if she was about to go fetch some for the gal right away. Alas, the optimism immedidately dropped as she&#39;d face away.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5a5a8c>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) strolled out of the store, sporting his fresh pair of clothes. This was it, his new gear to rotate with the other three sets he owned for the next couple of months. Money is tight, and he wasn&#39;t holding his breath for that to change anytime soon.

But you know what? It didn&#39;t really seem to bug him. <font color = white>&#34;&lt;Already getting dark, huh?&gt;&#34;</font> he muttered to himself. His stomach rumbled like it was telling him to feed it! Its been four days since he&#39;s last ate anything!

<font color = white>&#34;Chill out, will you?&#34;</font> he half-whispered to his grumbling belly. One idea was hitting the mines, maybe get lucky and find something worth trading. But then again, there&#39;s always the chance he&#39;d bump into someone just as broke as him- But more desperate than him. A sufficient deterrent to keep him away from those mines for the time being.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: Well if anyone's interested in the fishing mission. I can give you money for the rod.
