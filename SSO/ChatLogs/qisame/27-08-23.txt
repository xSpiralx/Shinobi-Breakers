<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Guhhhhh...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) sagged, defeated and deflated. He took a breath through his wide, flared nostrils, then turned and looked over his shoulder as intensely and confidently as possible, flashing a cheeky grin and batting his thickly lashed eyes while smirking devilishly. A thumbs up rocketed towards Raihara.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Thanks for your support!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) pauses for a moment, does she not notice him...? This lady&#39;s a Shinobi, no? If so, then she should be able to realize her precious weapon is about to be swiped away from her at any given moment! Shun&#39;Ichi hesitates, turning over toward his sister once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, that girl&#39;s a Shininijobi or whatever, right?&#34;</font> He aims to clarify, since Sakuya&#39;s been outside longer than he has, perhaps she was present whenever Komo demonstrated some sense of skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: Never needed one? You're tha strong?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t seem to care about the formal attire of his cousin, not even their young age. It should be pretty standard for Uchiha&#39;s to have some geniuses every now and then, and he was curious as to what Kohaku was capable of.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh trust me, I spotted quite a few promising... if not interesting, people already.&#34;</font> If both Kohaku and Batsu followed his gaze, they would see him glancing at Might, Try and then at both Hajime and Shishorama talking near the police officer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) eyes did not change from his normal blank, bored expression. Was this some kind of prank? His cold black eyes merely looked at Try, unblinking.

<font color = white>&#34;Support? Uh...Are you feeling okay?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: OH YEAH!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: ou're not that strong are you?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Never better Raihara. Why?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Yes, legends of the village would say I have a hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Cuz today starts our shinobi adventure! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) delicately shakes his hand with the appropriate amount of strength. She took great care not to actually harm her future comrades and classmates. It was her duty to protect those weaker than her, and she&#39;d uphold that belief until the bitter end.

<font color = white>&#34;When I win, I&#39;ll treat you to some food after.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: No reason...Nevermind it.
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: It looks like it.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: We should meet some of the other students.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) Kohaku didn&#39;t look much younger than Batsu, wondering just what he meant by feeling out of place. It felt natural for the Uchiha himself to finally become apart of the academy after the years of waiting. He&#39;d nod toward his clan member though, a head nod that usually gestures a greeting.

The statement about passing though the academy would resonate with him though, he&#39;d already expected the academy to be something he could easily maintain as his parents had made him study for as long as he could remember.

<font color = white>&#34;Pleasure to meet you Kohaku and yes... We will indeed exceed in this years academy.&#34;</font> he said, smirking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: But there are so many.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) asks: Do you want to have a hard ass head too? Or you just wanting to give it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) clicked her tongue, and idly produced a book from within her garment. Adding a pen to the mix, she began to scribble down on a seemingly blank page. Mysteries upon mysteries were written, surely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Well, I can introduce you to a few.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hummm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) scoffed at the declaration that he&#39;d beat herself and the other one. So, she did what anyone else in her position would. Push his buttons even harder.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... I&#39;ll just verbally agree to beat you then, I wouldn&#39;t want to touch your hand...&#34;</font> Her nose upturns just a tad, as though she would have caught something being too close to him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) stepped up to Kohaku and put his fists on his hips as he stared intently at the Uchiha trio just... breathing... waiting.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (dont mind my fists on your hips)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stands behind Try, his cold eyes just examining the three students before him. He would not make any introductions.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) reachs out and touches Shun&#39;Ichi green hair without permission. <font color = white>&#34;Is this natural?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) covers her mouth... She forgot she was with children.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had no idea that he had been held back on.

He simply figured that despite being part of the Senju, she was a girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;No way. I don&#39;t accept hand outs.&#34;</font> 

Despite Hinoue&#39;s clear reluctance, he steps forth and raises a fist towards her, to seek a fist bump. Defiant eyes lock onto her own. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ...And I'd never lose to you, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: ....... Don't worry about that! Answer my question, is that sword girl a ninshija?

<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

  She pulled out an attachment, a small spade like object that she wiggled into place on the top of her staff. The tool now resembles a hoe.

<font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Konoha&#39;s academy course. Ya&#39;ll be training to be shinobi that defends the lands of Fire, we shinobi are the heartline of this nation - Just like farmers.&#34;</font>

 Komo tosses her hoe hard towards the dirt behind the students, piercing and parting the dirt with force.

<font color = white>&#34;Instead of feeding mouths, we shinobi solves and prevent those farmer&#39;s problems from interrupting them making harvest.&#34;</font>

A hand extended facing the handed tool, as it suddenly came back to her grasp. <font color = white>&#34;To do that, we practice and master the use of all life force Chakra. Before we git to all that...&#34;</font>

The woman places the hoe back to her rear, facing the memorial.

<font color = white>&#34;This memorial is what we call tribute, tribute to all the shinobi that has succeeded their limits for their nation, some giving up their lives for you to even breathe and be born. The Will of Fire. If you disrespect this, you&#39;re disrespecting your births. Ya&#39;ll remember that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

His focus then shifted to the Tribute memorial... and he became a little more serious, even though the situation between Shishorama and the other Hyuuga was anything but that in his eyes.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) struggles to climb up the building and then stand besides Kyoko..

She would rummage in her pocket for a bit for taking out . . .
A STRAWBERRY MOCHI! 

She would offer it to Kyoko.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) would offer Kikyo a hand up to the roof, so they, too, many act like they&#39;re a shinobi. Once the pair were standing, she&#39;d skeptically peer down at the mochi that was being offered.

<font color = white>&#34;Hrm..!&#34;</font> Did she <i>really</i> want some mochi that was stuffed in some kid&#39;s pocket? She squints down, thoroughly inspecting the sweet to make sure it had no pocket lint stuck to it. If it ended up being clean, she would take it.
   <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, Kikyo.&#34;</font> Nomf.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) The mochi was infact clean!

Kikyo would jump up and cheer as Kyoko took her offer! She would then take out another and begin to munch on it. She was in true happiness right now.

<font color = white>&#34;Kyoko Sensei, how is it being a police officer?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) struggled to chew the soft, mushy treat, but she&#39;d manage. Once consumed, she&#39;d quietly sigh with content.

<font color = white>&#34;Mm-.. Being able to protect the village and those within it is an honor, and one I take great pride in.. That said, it&#39;s not a job I can recommend for everyone. At its core, the police force is a public service- we aid those that need it, and ensure the village is running smoothly. It&#39;s.. difficult, at times, but work I find very satisfying.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) watches the police cheif struggle witht he Mochi..

She would lower her head and take a big chomp of hers and jerk her head back as she lets the mochi deliciousness melt in her mouth.
It brought a beam of joy to her face.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm... Will I have the chance to become one? Even though I do not know how to fight?&#34;</font> She would say looking at Kyoko with admiration.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) looks down at the pair of optimistic eyes that were beaming up at her. A soft chuckle escapes her as she gives Kikyo a light pat on the head.

He awaits the boy&#39;s response as the intense youngster appears to launch the first strike. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s see what he does now.&#34;</font> The sharp-toothed boy&#39;s arms fold, observant in stance.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (you have 4)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) saw Shishorama close the gap between the two, now finally getting into striking range. About time their tiny little arms could see some action. She cocked her fist, launching it straight for his jaw.

Fortunately, the boy would lift his hands up infront of his face, letting his forearms take the brunt of the attack. His technique was rather lousy, to say th least.

As her attack ended it was time for his own, launching a counter-attack of his own, cocking his hand and sending it towards her gut.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) could hardly deal with Laro&#39;s raw offensive speed. As hardy and braggadocious as she was, she had little practice in the real art of battle, and lacked the capability to back up her talk with skill alone. Indeed, she was outclassed in every regard!

Still, she just barely manages a block and swings at Laro&#39;s chin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, this is close! I don&#39;t think I can beat you yet!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would once again attempt to evade the attack, this time ducking under attack. He'd quickly answer right back with a hit of his own, trying to once again hit at her body.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) is hit squarely in the gut. The girl&#39;s eyes bug out as the pain spreads through her abdomen. Strangely enough, her smile only grows. As his fist smashes into her body, could feel her sturdy frame harden as if preparing for the blow. She was well on her way to developing a tough physique, unfortunately she just wasn&#39;t there yet.

<font color = white>&#34;That was a good one!&#34;</font> She exclaims wildly as she throws yet another sloppy punch to the other&#39;s face!</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;A-am I late for something?&#34;</font> he&#39;d ask, tugging at his scarf nervously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) looked back at the wandering child- a wave tossed his way.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Some of the students wanted to get some practice before classes start.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) could feel that she was suprisingly sturdy compared to his hits, perhaps something he neeed to work on in due time. Yet he landed a hit, none-the-less. But it didn't seem like it slower her down much as she launched another attack right back at him.

Once again he managed to block it, but surely his ability to block shots was running out.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) smiled as he was informed he wasn&#39;t late.

<font color = white>&#34;Whew... Thank goodness.&#34;</font> he says, returning a wave towards the police chef now. They&#39;d then look on to the sparring match, observing the two going at it as he relaxed with the others.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, t-that sounds good.&#34;</font> he said, hoping to see what he might pick up from their match.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) he also punched her back.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With a swift movement, Shishorama brings her forearm up to deflect Laro's incoming strike. In a split second, she turns the tables and attempts to deliver a powerful blow to his sternum, showcasing her tenacity and grit despite her lack of refined martial prowess. Her unyielding spirit and unwavering determination serve as her greatest weapon, allowing her to hold her own against even the most skilled opponents.

His folded arm stance remains. The teen shifts to stand the amber-haired boy.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) nodded,

And it was quite a strong one, as she managed to hit him right into his sternum with a rather powerful punch. It knocked the air out of him, causing him to hunch over a bit, sustaining rather heavy injury.

As he held his stomach, it was quite evident, one of those would probably put him out of the commission.

He could probably land a few more hits on her but would it be enough? Probably not.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) As the white-haired dancer swings at her, Sakuya quickly parries the punch with her arm. Seizing the moment, she throws a punch right back, aiming for the dancer&#39;s midsection...Is what she would have done but her cousin saved her oddly.

<font color = white>&#34;Rather rude of you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between the two Senjus and white haired dancer. Was this an altercation brewing in real time. Perhaps something needed to be done to calm the tensions.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys, umm, how about we all just take a moment to cool off? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) crushed through the youngster&#39;s defenses, but found herself parried off-- Or something.

Someone got hit for the shit talking, so she let it be for now with scowling, red eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one calling people names.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighed and shook her head, <font color = white>&#34;I thought you guys were just being friendly. What do we actually call you then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) nervously watched the few bicker amongst themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...&#34;</font> is all he could manage to get out, deciding to not get in the middle of things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A pleasure to meet you Kamiya!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Swallowing her pride, she steps forward with her hand extended in a gesture of apology.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</font> she says sincerely, looking into the dancer&#39;s eyes. <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to offend you. If I&#39;ve said or done something to upset you, I apologize.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am not sure what I said as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gsaze as he never exactly got his question answered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Pfew. Glad that&#39;s sorted out. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) yawned, what a morning it had been already, just idly passing the time. She would just glance over to the girl next to her briefly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. We haven&#39;t spoken before but since we&#39;re standing here. I&#39;m Okiku.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) glad the fighting stopped. She would've just kept taking punches for either student until she passed out. Crisis averted.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sorry my cousin is aloof as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) squinted between them, obviously suspicious of the apology and pleasant greetings. Darting eyes warily regarded the hand gesture. This was the second weirdo to say something and then pretend they didn&#39;t know it&#39;d be a problem. Shoulders roll, dislocating and then -popping- back into place as she maintained her expression, despite the pain that should have caused.

<font color = white>&#34;... fine.&#34;</font> She mumbled, carefully taking her hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (was glad*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;That was rather... Keep doing that and you&#39;re going to have arthritis soon,&#34;</font> she says, pointing meaningfully at the girl&#39;s shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Teach me how to roll my shoulder like that!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks over at the shoulder dislocating like that.

<font color = white>&#34;That looked painful. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: You should get that checked out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) released the other girl&#39;s hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to teach. Just do it.&#34;</font> She replied, ignoring the cautions against arthritis. <font color = white>&#34;Of course it was painful.&#34;</font> She replied, wondering how it could not be-- or why anyone would do it if it wasn&#39;t. Dislocation could be useful for escaping binds, though...

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can ger arthiritis.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: get*
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Can you dislocate anything else?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I see this is today's new hangout.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: This will be my everyday hang out!
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) increases their health by Full - 6 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) yells: Mind if I see!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Kikyo has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: At least you'll be easy to find, Shishorama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) held a hand out and bent her index finger nearly all the way back, until it was curling backwards. This was less of a dislocation and more of a hypermobility, though-- but which kid would even care? There's a slight shift in expression, suggesting this was somehow more painful than the shoulder roll.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) widened her eyes at Kamiya&#39;s finger. What the heck is even that?! <font color = white>&#34;Oh my goodness! Your finger is <b>BROKEN</b>!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Nope, the bones are just fine.
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: ...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya watches with a mixture of fascination and curiosity as the white-haired dancer flexes her index finger backward in an extreme display of hypermobility. For a moment, Sakuya thinks she can detect a wince in the dancer&#39;s eyes, a subtle hint that this unusual flexibility comes at a cost.

Intrigued, a thought crosses Sakuya&#39;s mind: this girl might be just as eccentric as she is. Feeling a newfound sense of kinship, she can&#39;t help but feel that a friendship between them could be equally intriguing and enriching.

Taking a step closer, Sakuya smiles and extends her hand in a friendly gesture. <font color = white>&#34;You know, we might have more in common than we thought. Would you like to be friends? I&#39;m Sakuya, by the way. Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would dead pan and turn towards Shishorama.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s a Kaguya- Like the Hokage.&#34;</font> Hoping this would shed some light on their abilities in some compacity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s jaw dropped as he saw Kamiya&#39;s finger.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s...scary to see. Also anyone else started to feel pain in their fingers after seeing that? No, just me? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*she's)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I think he is a she.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [oh man ur lucky u fixed that]
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: So it was an over reaction?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Who cares that she's a Kaguya?! She just broke- twisted her finger!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Do we have a medic-nin nearby?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) let her finger snap back. <font color = white>&#34;Sure, Sakuy--&#34;</font> Kamiya stopped mid sentence, certain she had heard another unlucky soul who wanted to receive a punch. The feeling vanished after a moment. Her finger is held with her other hand, and its discolored, now-- significantly redder than the others, a little swollen. It was hardly a free action as evidenced by this cost.

<font color = white>&#34;It hurts, but it isn&#39;t broken.&#34;</font> She said, to the intense youngster. <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t break my bones.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) gave a long stare- A long confused, judgemental stare before mentally facepalming.

<font color = white>&#34;Her abilities are probably like Lord Hokage, a Kaguya... They manipulate bone.&#34;</font> A smirk came to his face, he found it funny people hadn&#39;t heard stories of the Leader of the Village. Though on a second glance... They could manipulate Bones... but the fleshy parts were still damaged.

<font color = white>&#34;Though, youf pain tolerance must be insane since you damage the flashy bits...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*your Typo 2/2 may as well aim for the moon in typos.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Can Kamiya manipulate my bones too?
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks:  You realized if they're okay then you shouldn't over react, right?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I would assume so.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (question, Kamiya
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (does Kamiya resemble a male?)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) grinned at the Uchiha on the end of the line. She approached the boy, and held  her swollen index finger out. There&#39;s a look of incredible focus. She grunted, and huffed, and puffed, the obvious spice of pain in her inflection as a -hole- began to open at the end of her finger, and a pure, white finger bone began to poke out. It&#39;s clear this is taking an exhaustive amount of effort as her entire body is shaking.

It was revolting; unsettling.

<font color = white>&#34;Pull my finger.&#34;</font> Urged a strained voice.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [yes]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [the other 11 year old kaguya]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (Kami M and Kami F.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I have a question before I pull your finger!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Are you a male or female? I'm not sure what to call you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) couldn&#39;t tell if she was talking to him or to the sable-haired youth next to him. Either way the request was rather weird. Kamiya wanted her finger to be pulled, while it seemed the bone was starting to protrude through the actual finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would blink for a moment, though in his morbid curiousity he&#39;d absolutely do so. He wondered if that bone was in-fact coming out of that gory hole Kamiya&#39;s body seem to make. The Uchiha heard stories of the bones tearing through skin of both user and foe, this was far more clean than anticipated. However there was a strangeness to it when seeing something like this first hand.

The weird part was seeing how white the bone was despite it travelling through fleshm he expected them stained red, really.

<font color = white>&#34;Gnarly.&#34;</font> It was the only wword he could think of while doing this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clenched her jaw as he pulled an entire digit out. The hole closed, and rather than some gelatenous, boneless finger like one woudl expect, Kamiya seemed no worse for wear than before. There wasn&#39;t even a sign that she&#39;d just opened and inch wide hole in her flesh. The pain was real, but there were not lasting effects. 

She took the finger from him and wagged it in his face, the digit bouncing and bending at each knuckle. 

<font color = white>&#34;And now I can use this like a dagger!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) carefully observed the whole thing. The word &#39;gnarly&#39; described it well. But the boy got so invested into the process that he could see every little detail. And this, well, this had undesired results.

Dark haired boy immediately covered his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh I think I&#39;m gonna be sick. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: ---
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: She just -- pulled the -- bone out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the finger, dumbfounded. She thought she&#39;d seen a lot in her twelve years of life, but that was absolutely <i>disgusting</i>. Never wanting to witness that again, she persists in asking Kamiya the question that bothered her so greatly.

<font color = white>&#34;So....are you a male or female...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly wheeled around, slashing the intense youngster with her abnormally sharp finger bone.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you stupid?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Well, no...maybe..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wasn&#39;t sure if he should find this cool, scary, concerning, or morbid. He proceeded to mentally choose all of the above.

<font color = white>&#34;Eeeehww, but awesome. That&#39;s taking &#39;pointer finger&#39; very literally.&#34;</font> Making fun of the situation rather than keeling over sick, though he really had no idea how to react and fell back on humour as a coping mechanism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the they/them, unphased. <font color = white>&#34;I just can&#39;t tell, okay?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: It's really obvious I'm a girl, you weirdo.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: O-Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Right!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Because the voice!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...And the hair...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: R-Right!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: And the pretty face? 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The other Kami is a guy.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: And the unearthjly grace?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Well, you certainly have unearthly grace!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Yeah that last one...oh never mind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) loomed.

<font color = white>&#34;Right?&#34;</font> She whispered, dangerously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Don't all Kaguya have the poise?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) leaned closer to Kamiya with a quirked eyebrow, <font color = white>&#34;Why are we whispering?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Ei!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) makes a small yelp in surprise. She wasn&#39;t easily intimidated, but Kamiya was getting there. <font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you poking me with that!? It came from inside you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) covers his mouth again as she poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Pointer Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sticky Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: It's not my fault that I couldn't tell what you were! You didn't ask to be born like that!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I feel a punch coming.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I have a feeling it'd be more like a puncture wound.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly whipped the finger toward the wall, letting it smash against it into bits and pieces.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re pretty stupid. You&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t beat up special needs children.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: So the bones can break...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: That is a good one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) frowned a bit at the Kaguya&#39;s remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey hey, no need to call names. We&#39;re all friends here. Right? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighs and relaxes as the tension in her body dies down. She was expecting a punch or stab, but it never came. <font color = white>&#34;Phew...that was close. - I wonder when the classes are going to start.&#34;</font> She says, looking off into the distance. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Laro(The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) OOCs: ( hmm so are apps closed? )

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) shrugged, <font color = white>&#34;No idea when, but I want to start as soon as possible. If it&#39;s going to use any sort of Chakra I&#39;ll be more than prepared.

I&#39;m just hoping it&#39;ll be very soon, I actually want to do something more than a team work and trust exercise today.&#34;</font> The Traditional Uchiha admitted, pulling out a fan to cool himself once more. He wondered if they would learn anything, or would it be a second exercise? For now it was hard to tell.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would munch on his food, now properly swallowing it before he talked. He&#39;d also look down the table at everyone who sat around.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) paused. 

Her limited attention span was drawn to the events taking place nearby. Aversion, repulsion, and every sickened emotion in between creased and wrinkled her face, watching someone eat a fish of all things in such a animalistic manner!

<font color = white>&#34;Gross. Fish are gross! Don&#39;t you know where that thing&#39;s been, Maya?!&#34;</font>
She waved her arms frantically in protest!</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;This river, I caught it myself...&#34;</font>

A simple answer to a straight forward questio as her head cocked to the side in a curious manner.

<font color = white>&#34;And it&#39;s a fresh as it comes, orphans can&#39;t be picky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Wait! I know what to do. We should check if she's choking or just poisoned.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) a single weak hand raised towards her chest as she began to pound it with a closed fist whilst being dragged away by Hanako.

It was indeed a pin bone that she had swallowed, a sharp end had lodged itself within the base of her esophagus and needed to be dislodged.

However she was too weak to dislodge it herself, causing each weak dull thump to just cause her to choke loudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) held mochi to her mouth as the girl barragged her with words... She didn't exactly understand sarcasm... She just stared at her...</font></font></font>

She peers through the surface of the Gorumba&#39;s throat for a blockage, then down towards her stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;I knew it! She&#39;s choking, I&#39;ll get it out,&#34;</font> she claimed before reaching to still Maya from Hanako in order to pull her upright, <font color = white>&#34;Let me.&#34;</font> She straightens a hand out into a palm... And immediately slammed it against Maya&#39;s back to dislodge the bone.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Yeah, hit her in the solar meridian left and to the east point!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) deciding that, Maya&#39;s life was not being tended to properly, the young Hajime suddenly breaks off into a sprint. This needed to be a precise move to work, or else, it simply would not work.

He had seen it happen before..! 

<font color = white>&#34;No pain, no gain..&#34;</font>

After garnering the necessary momentum, the young orphan jumps onto Maya&#39;s stomach to deliver a drop kick with the force of gravity behind it, performing the most violent heimlich maneuver possible..!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got you..!&#34;</font>

The fact that the Hyuuga was trying to save her had ignited his competitive spirit, and he wished to do so, instead. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) nods her head. Infact she seem more annoying having to deal with it than she initiately expressed.
  Her grin lowered as she swatted down.

<font color = white>&#34;Look. I was ordered to do something about it, and I will. I must carry it out, however my conscience won&#39;t allow me to let a child drown. So, don&#39;t worry about it.

You must understand that some people we work with will not take kindly to casual banter as the rest of us. Just do your best to endure it, yeah?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) An overbearingly smug grin hooked upon the corners of the Hyuuga&#39;s lips and tugged wider as she witnessed her perfect strike dislodge the fish bone straight from the source. It surprised her a little, but she would never admit that. As far as anyone else knew, this was planned and she was the most skilled academy student.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahaha! You&#39;re welcome. Nothing comes close to my clan&#39;s techniques after all,&#34;</font> she proclaimed, side-eyeing Hajime after he had failed to compete and was now being dragged off to heal underwater. Or attempted to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) The backhand, caught him off-guard! The Senju sibling was definitely quicker than the Kedoiin, which forces him to bite on his tongue fiercely. <font color = white>&#34;Owhhhhh! Sahu--&#34;</font> Followed by Kamiya&#39;s own violent outburst, though, he wouldn&#39;t give the girl the satisfaction of hitting him.

Blocking the girl&#39;s attack, he continues to whine with a damaged tongue, <font color = white>&#34;Buh, Kahiha sarhed i&#39; &#39;he ot&#39;er deh!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) accepts the yank!

He rises to his feet with her aid, a tad wobbly. He threatens to wobble in all four cardinal directions and fall again, due to the previous impact.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow. Can you guys stop spinning, please?..&#34;</font> He requests, before side-eyeing the spinning Hanako as well, with a faint flash of spite.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Hinoue.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Hm?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) relentlessly attacked, delivering another kick. He seemed to think this was some sort of game--

It was not, as the blood poured from her own rakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) noticed Hajime&#39;s unsteadiness.

A swirl that carried him east, north, west, south! Hm! Clearly the remedy for such things was to spin him in the opposite direction, as to unwind the factors that made him dizzy in the first place! So! She grasped him by the shoulders and spun him clockwise, akin to a kid being prepared for their turn at a pinata. 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s okay! I&#39;ll just.. unspin you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I'm a medical professional. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) was not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) arched a brow inquisitively as the veiny protrusions spreading from those fainty lavender orbs would gradually soften and lose their prominence - no longer visible against skin. She wondered what could have prompted this request, but she doubts it was anything bad after witnessing her greatness just now.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... Alright, sure,&#34;</font> she obliged, <font color = white>&#34;Lead the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Oh no.

<font color = white>&#34;W-wait..! Unspin..? Wah..!&#34;</font>

The unspinning has the opposite effect and he finds himself teetering even more, until he threatens to collapse right onto Hanako..! A hand rises to cover his mouth, as well.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) recognized that shade of green. Why-- that&#39;s the same shade of green she took on mere moments ago, watching Maya chomp on raw fish! She frantically circled him, intent on escaping his potential spew range!

<font color = white>&#34;Ack, abort, abandon mission! It didn&#39;t work! It didn&#39;t work!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) pulled a chair out of her pocket and took a seat on the bridge to watch the commotions until something else happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Seeing that the situation has escalated beyond any hope of peaceful resolution, Sakuya joins Kamiya in taking decisive action against Shun&#39;Ichi. She launches into a coordinated assault, seamlessly blending their movements into a relentless series of kicks and stomps. What unfolds could be likened to what is widely known as <font color = white>&#34;being jumped,&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) collapses to the ground, and though he keeps his mouth covered for a few moments, he soon breathes a sigh of relief.

He had avoided death itself. Or the death of his self-image for the foreseeable future.

Only after a few moments, does he tilt his head backwards while lying on the ground to finally realize that the fight was still ongoing.

<font color = white>&#34;W-woah... They&#39;re jumping that kid... &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hm??
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Nah, they're just helping him out. Probably. He's clearly choking.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) passes off the fish.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Hm? Just a normal day at the orphanage... kids have to be strong enough to protect themselves.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Like, when you talk back against the big kid in the orphanage..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) received a bunch of fish. She released them back to their natural habitat.

First order of business, getting away from Kamiya--she&#39;s the stronger one of the two, if his memory serves him correctly, so getting away from her would prove advantageous, forcing him to only deal with Sakuya.

He&#39;s never won a fight against her, though today&#39;s the day he might be given the chance to try.
Kamiya is evaded this time, with Sakuya being blocked. He uses Sakuya&#39;s weight to bounce away from the dynamic duo and more toward the riverbanks. The bell sounds, however, he knows the kids won&#39;t relent; and he doesn&#39;t plan on doing so either.
<font color = white>&#34;Coh&#39; aht meh... Bich&#39;s.&#34;</font> He states, as long as Kamiya&#39;s interrupted by Sakuya, he&#39;s safe, somewhat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Hey, hey! Two on one isn't fair..!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) delivers the line that had gotten him stomped out at the orphanage many times.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) was on his ass. Was she lying about him being faster? It seemed like it...

Just as a punch is about to be thrown to his cranium, though, the dancer twisted her body away and cartwheeled to a standing position.

<font color = white>&#34;I head the academy bell. You&#39;re lucky.&#34;</font> she said, to the fat-tongued boy. <font color = white>&#34;You will apologize to me after class or you&#39;re going to keep getting this.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t a very hard demand to meet, luckily for him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya stopped her assualt. It was time for class.

<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be inconviencing us like this Shun.&#34;</font> She shrugs as she readies herself to leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Kikyo has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) breathes a sigh of relief once he sees that yet another stomping had been averted..! No doubt thanks to his efforts, as he had told them that stomping was wrong, and to cease. Clearly, this was a victory for him.

He rises to his feet after a few moments, still a bit wobbly, but he smiles regardless.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;all wanna&#39; head to that lesson?&#34;</font> He asks, before his gaze focuses upon the one referred to as Shun.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, man! You alright?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, shoot. I'm gonna be late! 
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: You're gonna be early.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: It's okay to be a little early, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. wait. I still haven't turned in my application. I can't be late.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Turn it in..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm safe.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No! I like the immunity! 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: You wanna' be immune to graduation, too?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: If I turn it in, they'll start keeping my lateness on record--
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. I'll turn it in the day before I graduate.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's the perfect crime.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Huh. Smart...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll go on ahead! Uh-- where's the class at? 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: West.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) blew a raspberry at Kamiya and Sakuya, moving to the snow to shove some in his mouth, hopefully it'll stop swelling soon. Though, the Kaguya's sudden advancement did muddle him slightly... Just how much quicker has she gotten in the past few days...? And how quickly could she advance?

Well, there's a limit to how much power one could produce without actively dipping their toes into the Shinobi world... Perhaps it was simply a gap in skill as opposed to some innate talent or development. Yeah... That's probably it.
He ignores Hajime, watching the duo who nearly beat his ass strut off, enviously figuring out how to get some revenge.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: This guy looks fine.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: We should all go... I'll see you there.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Which way is west--
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Guess we can head over.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll follow him! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) strutted off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) pointed behind him, south of the bridge, the boy was going the opposite way of class it seemed.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) yells: Did I make it in time?!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Indeed you did.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: You're late.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You made it!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Tch..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: There is a time or two in here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) A single glance at her is enough to make him go completely stiff, as he straightens his posture and stares straight ahead without an ounce of relaxation possible in his physique.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I'm not going to eat you...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: One moment. I will have to hunt for someone.
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: Just be nice to me, and we can be good friends.
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Haha...I didn't think so... I mean... 
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Uh... R-right... I can be nice...
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) yells: F-found it!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Kamiya eats people that aren't nice to her?!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) yells: Oh. Good job!
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I only attacked that idiot with green hair because he called me a brat. Then he called me a thing-- twice.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) overheard something scary. So, like any reasonable citizen, she looked away and whistled poorly. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I'm not that strange...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held up a single seal, before disappearing with parting words.

<font color = white>&#34;Class, this is Senju, Akitaru. One of the Jonin. He&#39;ll be babysitting you for abit, while I am away.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Umm...Sure..! We can get a few friends to play tag, yes...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) sighed softly and took center stage. He was silent, waiting for the class to settle, stareing out at each student. He memorized faces and hair styles, but more then that, ke felt for who they were.</font></font></font>
