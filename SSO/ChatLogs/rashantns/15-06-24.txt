<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not either,but is good to practice what you have learned.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shrugged once more. <font color = white>&#34;I study on my own, but nothing too serious.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns to acknowledge the newly arrived person.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I see...then,what do you want to do after the academy ends?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Has...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Has the academy even STARTED yet?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank look to that question. <font color = white>&#34;What does a bird want to do when it&#39;s no longer a chick? We are Shinobi, most of us here will be fighting and probably dying for the village.&#34;</font> He said plainly. <font color = white>&#34;Hopefully dying later than sooner...&#34;</font> he added in a low tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It did started.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It will end in a year.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And...not everyone is a fighter.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: It is why I said "most of us here."
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: True..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case..hopefully we meet each other thoughout the year and inside the battlefield.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded and tried to shake off the grimness of his words, almost as if they were not his own. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: By the way, did I not catch your name, or...?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yakushi,Najiro
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I am back.)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Future medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, sorry, I must have been deep in thought, I see we have another fellow student? Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded. <font color = white>&#34;Ah... so you&#39;ll be trying to keep us among the living.&#34;</font> He said with a soft smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked once again at the child in the kimono, who has not said a word since they arrived.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: More of keeping people who are worthy to live.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But yes,trying to keep people alive.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Noted.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I would say all lifes are worthy, really...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) pulled his sunhat over his eyes, mostly to avoid the glaring light of the streetlamp above him.
<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s a kinda weird way of looking at it, I mean... I think choosing who&#39;s worthy of living, that&#39;s not on us to decide as people.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I mean, if I had to kill someone? Sure. But it's not because I chose to, it's because their bad choices in life led them to that moment where karma decided they weren't worthy of continuing on, right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its a certain view Hanamura.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can explain it later..but for now guess i will relax on the bench
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So the recent genin killings were karma too?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man... I didn't hear nothing about that, don't quote me on anything.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked at Saigosame with some seriousness on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: That's been talked about all over the village...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: ... A-anyways...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I wonder if any of the teachers are going to be around soon. It would be amazing to learn more.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: For real? This is the first I'm hearing about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Anyway- Killing for the SAKE of killing is a sure-fire way to end up in bad karma. So, whoever DID do all that will get theirs soon enough.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) let the topic go, as he didn't want to sour the mood further, but nodded at Saigosame in response. Then, he turned to Hanamura. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hanamura,i will see you later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Think to do the whole..zoning out.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Are you alright, Najiro?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: im fine.Just gonna do some..napping
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Very well. We'll talk more later, then.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, I guess the Hyuuga have no trouble seeing at night, so they are fine appearing in the dark.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Ughhh... Hello, mister Sun.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Please shine ANYWHERE other than my face, thank you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) cast a lofty gaze on those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckles softly, looking over towards the Hoshigaki again.
<font color = white>&#34;You really are not a morning, or maybe even day person, are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yamaki (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: No such thing as karma...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shuddered for a moment, as he realized someone was observing them from behind, then turned around slowly.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean. When I get my good and proper eight to twelve hours a day...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Then I'm chipper as can be. Today is not one of those days...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: I'm sorry to hear that. If there's a way I can cheer your day up, I'd be willing to try?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) generalize gaze would slowly hone in on the person seeking eye contact with him.
  <font color = white>&#34;....?&#34;</font> - he tilts his head to the side.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (Back. Freaking cat jumped on my PC's Power Button. xD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) ponders, for a few moments. Eventually, he raises a hand, and points up at the sun.
<font color = white>&#34;Make THAT go away.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) he lifted one hand in a greeting at the newly arrived person. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Kfh, no, I'm kidding. I'm going to head back home and get some actual sleep. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) picked himself up from the ground with a grumble, stretching his arms for a few moments before lumbering over towards the wall to his west. Without a second thought, he steps over the threshhold into the water, and disappears under the current.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) leans his head over ever so slightly in that of a nod.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: He must be -really- tired, huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) took a few more moments to size the fellow student up, then nodded and turned back to the centre of the gathering place.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I suppose so. He was quite tired when he arrived. I suppose he really needs a long nap, then. Which is fine, no classes have begun yet - today at least. As far as I am aware.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Hm? Oh, hey there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) looks from side to side. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay then.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Since there aren't much of any teacher awake or around, should we try to train, like, spar or something?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: ...Oh that's where everyone is.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: And I suppose we could spar, if any of you are interested. Could even make a sort of 'team spar' to see how well we work together. But, do not feel forced to, of course.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns his head back to look at the finely dressed kid, then put up a hand as a greeting.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) muttered something beneath his breath and began advancing forward towards the crowd. Maintaining his silence he'd hope to melt into the group seamlessly as they continued their discussion. However it seemed as though there was about to be a spar between two of the children. 

Closing his distance tween him and the others, the child began assessing the two. Maybe they were the top boys of Amegakure, or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) folds his arms and watches the bout from afar.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets again.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m fine with a spar or anything, really. Team or not. But yeah, I do wish the teachers would wake up and such, heh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm up for it. Would be nice to know what and who I'm working with in the future.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) looked towards the Yuki and the green-haired person before chuckling, covering her mouth as she did.
<font color = white>&#34;Three of us, then... Well, I suppose you two could spar, if you&#39;d like, and I&#39;ll just watch? That is, unless someone would like to join in?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Sure, I'll be up for that. You, Kusahara?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, sounds good.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Well, shal we do it here, or wanna go elsewhere? You got an idea, Hana?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm fine either way, but we don't want to go too far, in case the teacher arrives.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: When I sparred earlier, we went west a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Lead the way, then.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Follow me, hahaha. -- Anyone wanting to watch, feel free to watch along, as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) stretches his arms then follows briskly after the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) scratched his head as he questions as to where the party of children might have ran off to. He two wanted to see some combat. Take a moment to assess the foot tracks left in the dirt, the mild manner boy would take off and began his hunt.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) says: Test.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Sid (The sidious admin-Sidious26) says: Test passed.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) says: Real.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Don't be like that, you're fine.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly approaches the bench where the other two individuals are situated. Their eyes never averting their gaze away from the bench where they are approaching. She slowly sits on the bench, clasping his palms together and resting their chin on their hands.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) takes a deep breath, the pain in his stomach now only a mild sensation reminding him of his sparring match. As he heard the child approaching and sitting down, his attention was drawn to her. Noting the bored posture, he raised an eyebrow. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) looked towards the child, a slight ponder was made before he&#39;d speak up.
<font color = white>&#34;You okay? Got bored or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly turns their head towards the two boys situated on the opposite end of the bench. His soft features seemingly slightly shimmering against the bright sunlight. A small sigh escapes their lips, as they begin to speak.

<font color = white>&#34;Boring? Yes, I guess that is a good way to describe it. Nothing ever happens around here...&#34;</font>, they say with the tone of an irritant child.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nothing happens? What do you mean? A lot has been going on, and a festival is starting soon, as well...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) frowns slightly. <font color = white>&#34;I would enjoy the peace while it lasts, personally.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a small yawn as they sat near the monument his hazel eyes scanning the other faces nearby</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: All of that is...boring.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So what do you consider exciting?
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Anyways, Kusahara, got any plans?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: I dont know..Something...fun maybe?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turned to Subaru. <font color = white>&#34;Not really.&#34;</font> He said, leaning back on the bench, and turning to the new kid. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, like what? There are many things one can find fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I dont know.. Maybe playing? Like ninja tag!
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Right...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) almost chuckled at that. Despite being thirteen, he already felt like it was a lifetime ago when he found childish things fun. <font color = white>&#34;I mean, I guess that&#39;s fun. We&#39;ll be needing to catch people when we go out on missions anyway, so in a way... it&#39;s training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) slowly rises up and stretches before sighing. <font color = white>&#34;Anyway, I&#39;ll go home and read something. That&#39;s my idea of fun on a sunny morning. See ya!&#34;</font> He&#39;d say and walk off towards his house.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Yuki, Amehara has gone AUTOAFK*
