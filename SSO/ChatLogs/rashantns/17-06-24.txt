<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) waved as the cabbage reeking individual left.

     <font color = white>&#34;Take care.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Hana and simply say

<font color = white>&#34;More of most people sleep,and i read alot.But anyway,i won&#39;t ask anymore questions,if thats what you want.&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (to react?
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Oh. I need to warn that guy about the shoe eating sharks.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He blames a fellow student for his missing shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Eh? We eat shoes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: News t'me.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Thats his issue.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns towards the voice.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a sha--..&#34;</font>

She trails off, the obvious note of his features coming into play.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh. Right.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Meh, I'm jus' here to make money, 'nd serve my nation, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Sounds simple enough to me!
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I know I had them when we were training Suimen and he was there. Now they're gone.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) blinks, not having expected such a thing from the stern boy as he reached for his pouch.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, thanks for the heads up.&#34;</font>
They said, resting a hand on the shoes he had stolen from the boy as it seemed the blame got shifted to one of the Shark clan.
<font color = white>&#34;When i see them i&#39;ll ask them about your shoes&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He begin their negativity against me after i  gave up in a sparring match
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: You.. gave up? How come?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It was a tournament set up by fellow students,hosted by one of the jounins.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I gave up cause the fight was simply dragging too damn much
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If one didn't pursuit the other they quickly regain their breath and continue to fight.Due to us being students this becomes too easy..so a strategic fight cannot really happen
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) folds her arms across her chest. Her head tilts as she follows the boy&#39;s words. Eventually, she--

     <font color = white>&#34;You say a lot of words..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Indeed!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Learn t'condense 'em!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: To put it in a simple manner,he hates how i didn't continued the fight and pursuit untill one of us loses.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And sees my actions as being a coward.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Blah blah blah blah blah.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Put simply, screw what other people say - jus' do you, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: The Shark has a point.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Jinbeisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you think i don't know this? Im not bothered by their words,im simply dissapointed by their behavior
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will call you Jinby.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) walked up to the still-gathered group and overheard the end of the conversation. He frowned, his brow furrowing. <font color = white>&#34;You have a bad opinion of me for wanting you to do better? Hm...&#34;</font> Asa shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets. <font color = white>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Jinbei or Jinby, I don't care which!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I like Jinby better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, raising a finger as she blurts out--

     <font color = white>&#34;Beisame!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Beisame.. Sure.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Kfhfhfh... Beisame has a ring to it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its the fact how you acted.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And what you faced as consequences today.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I am who I am.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Do you take me to be ashamed of what happened today? Embarrasses, maybe, Not ashamed. Every defeat is a lesson.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (embarrassed*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) I thought Jinby was pretty good...
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his chin. Repeating the name to himself multiple times. A multitude of names he would need to grow attached too.
     <font color = white>&#34;Jus&#39; call me whatever y&#39;like - so long as it&#39;s respectful - and I&#39;ll respond to it!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: So far 'Beisame' is in th'lead.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, you've got to include the 'same' part or thats just ignoring your family.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: hm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mhm, mhm. The 'Same' part is the most important bit.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Right! Exactly like I prefer 'Beisame', actually takes that factor into equation.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Wh-..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I think Jinby is the best.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (Shizuma is hoshigaki too ya know XD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, her brow narrowing at the boy&#39;s question. Her hand gestures towards Beisame-- mostly pointing towards the various visible shark features on his face.

     <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t tell?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (that hoshigaki from boruto
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Listen. Calling a Hoshigaki a name without 'same' is like calling a Senju a name without 'rama' , it's a bad omen.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: It'll ruin your karma.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will look at them both and say
<font color = white>&#34;Zama is also a name in their clan.Surprized nobody knows this&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: 'Rama is more relevant, though.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) nods, sagely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It's just the 'ama' part, isn't it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) nods in turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (*zuma
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Ame and Ama.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Im still going to call him, Jinby. Got it, sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sharky feels like a slur, almost.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It isn't?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm no rubber-ducky nor fuzzy plaything.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,what do you want to be your nickname
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I feel like they get a pass on account of the fact they're like... Small...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I'd be pretty upset if someone called me 'Sharky'.. Kind of down plays the whole family.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If it was anyone else it'd feel racially charged, but in this instance it feels like childlike innocence.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Oh shut your yapping, blondie.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmm, you may be right, cous'.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Sharky doesn't mind me calling him, Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: okay..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Now it's gettin' weird.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Do your, Sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: *you
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I don't feel th'need to repeat myself.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: i will go for a quick run across the village.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not talking to you, Jinby.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm talking to Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Keep up.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: So - my cousin?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: A.K.A., someone from my clan.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) dismissively waved her hand. Oddly enough, the comment didn&#39;t really have the same sting to it.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s just asking for one of them to get mad at you..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..just this group here.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: What does your clan have to do with knowing your name?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Or nickname rather? Nicknames are fun!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: What is this even about.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Nicknames for Hoshigaki.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I gave Jinby a nickname and someone said something about it being Ra-sh-a-ly charged.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I dont think they like me calling Sharky, Sharky....
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: But Sharky doesn't mind.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Uh-huh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....Anyway.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Well if they don't like it why not respect their wishes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I care less for it anymore.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: Who tells a little girl her nicknames are racist?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: thats a boy
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..Is it?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: It?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yuki clan have very feminine males.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) steps forward. Her hand comes to her chin as she glances over them.

    <font color = white>&#34;I.. can&#39;t really tell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: If it means anything.....I don't know any of you people names either.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Same, t'be fair.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Najiro. You need glasses my little shinobi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) loses their childlike innocense and glares at the profound blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Who are you calling it, you hag!?&#34;</font>, they exclaim, their face puffing and arms crossing across their small body.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: That's a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Both of them are sisters i think
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: How dare you misgender me cabbage breathe!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (OMIT)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) pointed at the two Yuki's</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....thats definatly a boy
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Oh with the exception of cabage breath over there.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (inserts 2024 lesson on gender pronouns into naruto game)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both are boys infact.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello Bill.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And My name is Najiro,Rose.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Hello, Perfume lady.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) gave Bill the senju nod of approval.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Little Girl tell Najiro to get his eyes checked.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Mind carrying my bags?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Little girl?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;H-Hag?&#34;</font>

The insult causes a visible recoil from the girl. Her entire aura shrinks as she recalls the second conversation she had with this group. There was no way she--

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not old! We&#39;re probably all the same age!&#34;</font> she shouts in protest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do it yourself
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm simply Jinbeisame, or as th'lady beside me called me, 'Beisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: They are not heavy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) points up at the older profound blonde. Their small frame still slightly dwarfed by the older child.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m 10. Your at least like...Like...16! You&#39;re ancient for a shinobi!&#34;</font>, he exclaims.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: And i'm Hannah Montana.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says:  Hey...can you tell him that you are a boy
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Everyone belives you are a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) asks: Hannah's a Boy?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Who is even Hannah?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Points at that Cold child</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm a boy..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) walked forward and stood beside the two students.
<font color = white>&#34;Aye, Hana, you are too old to get into it here with this kid, especially on the new bridge.&#34;</font>
He tucked away his touch and placed a hand on top of the cold child&#39;s head.
<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be talking like that to people older than you, kid.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he would make his way over to stand next to the Cold child. Before looking towards the others. <font color = white>&#34;I can tell, But that might also be because...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hana,in their defense
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You do look...mature.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not a hag but...that early puberty hit you hard.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) feels a hand grasp the top of his head. Quickly, he scurries to the side to remove the unrequested touch and stands next to his cousin.

<font color = white>&#34;You mind your business too grandpa.&#34;</font>, he said, before turning his attention to the others who seemed to be debating over his gender.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t even look like a girl. I&#39;m clearly a boy!&#34;</font>, he says.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) glanced.. down? Wow. The kid really was shorter than her. Both of her fists came to her hips, her expression quickly shifting to showcase her brief stint of anger.

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only <i>thirteen</i>, smooth-bits! Don&#39;t get mad at me because you&#39;re stuck between a boy and a girl!&#34;</font>

She leans forward, an almost-visible spark of tension between the two shinobi. That was, well, until the cabbage-reeker stepped between them.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Y-ouch.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (Im waiting on soft feature and cabbage then I will rp again)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (i want to establish a scene now that its not just chat)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hana,please calm down.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Didn't wanted both parties to fight one another</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) did. Bets were to be made.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would move to stand next to his cousin. To be fair he himself looked far girlier than the other. But he wore traditional masculine clothes. That&#39;s probably what made him not be mistaken for a girl so often. He looks towards the other. <font color = white>&#34;Things could be far worse.&#34;</font>  He remarks with a little laugh, <font color = white>&#34;The real question is does our clan have any Girls, or will all the Hyuuga be too scared to check.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Like a Gatcha game.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) squinted their eyes at the cold child, a thick vein appearing on their forehead at the kid&#39;s words.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only 13, you brat!&#34;</font>
Their hand shot into their pouch as they quickly lost their temper, not knowing why they tried to be the voice of reason when they had such a short fuse.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Bill...

They moved their hand forward, disregarding the sudden shift in the air as he touched the cold child&#39;s forehead and flicked them with a finger.

<font color = white>&#34;You even move like an old man. You couldn&#39;t hit me with a strike that slow if you tried&#34;</font>, he said coldly, still having not moved an inch from where he stood.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) So much for letting things play out on their own.

Another insult tossed in the girl&#39;s direction immediately causes her to kiss her teeth. She rushes forward, the once-dying flame of anger relit within her spirit. It takes only a few strides for her to close the gap between herself and the androgynous youth. In that instant the gap is closed, her right hand curls into a fist.

     <font color = white>&#34;Shut... <b>UP!</b>&#34;</font>

Said fist is brought upward from the fiery blondes side. It rockets forward with accuracy and prowess unexpected of a girl of her stature and demeanor; danger lurking within just mere contact. All of that aggression is channeled into a mighty, organ rattling haymaker to the cold youth&#39;s stomach.

</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid insult when a lightning fast strike barrels toward their stomach. His senses pick up in the shift of the girl before she moves, however his small body is not trained enough for his reflexes to allow him to react. 

In an instant, he feels his stomach collapse in on itself, as a hand is buried into his abdomen. They feel themselves sent reeling backwards, their small hands grasping their stomach, as they fall to their knees.

<font color = white>&#34;Owww! How...How could you?! You evil, hag!&#34;</font>, he coughs and sputters attemping to catch his breathe. He would feebly get to his feet, spreading his legs in a battle stance. His cold intensity quickly returning, as he rushes the girl, his fist clenched as he attempts to punch her in her hag face.

<font color = white>&#34;Take this!&#34;</font>, he yells, as his fist surges towards her face at a speed that would only be impressive to a beginner academy shinobi.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) In that moment where her fist pushes into the cold youth's midsection, there's almost a euphoric feeling for the inflictor of pain. A sense of self-inflicted justice nearly erases that rage in just that one strike-- a proper punishment for an act that <i>surely</i> would lead to change.

It even reflects in her face; a pursed lip relaxes into an almost shit-eating grin.

<i>'Hag'</i>..

A shame that such 'happiness' is cut short by yet <i>another</i> insult upon her, this time paired with a strike at her person. She steps back, the gap in their height providing her an easy advantage to avoid its returned strike. All it takes is a simple lean to avoid that inexperienced strike.

The one that responds is nothing of the sort.

As fist fades past her face, her body drops down to <i>its</i> height. Her other hand curls up now and, yes again, poises to send yet another thunderous blow to his gut.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) grunts as he exerts his full force behind his strike, yet his fist is met with the cold emotionless embrace of empty space. This girl...She was no ordinary academy student, yet the young Yuki's pride would not let him give up as he quickl began formulating his next plan.

That would be in vain though, as in the same instant as his fist missed her face, he would be met by the thunderous impact of another fist to his midsection. The sickening sound of crunching bones, shattering ribs, and youthful screaming erupting into the air.

His cold eyes would roll to the back of his head, as he crumbled to the ground holding his stomach before lurching over face down. His mind would go blank as he met the cold embrace of oblivion..Or rather unconciousness.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) Another devastating shot to its core. Another feeling of relaxation. That scream it releases doesn&#39;t even register in the girl&#39;s head. Her fist relaxes, the palm catching the unconcious student as they fall forward. There comes only the slightest push-- a nudge to cause him to fall backwards rather than onto her.

A sigh of true relief exits her. With that situation handled, she turns back towards Beisame. Her stance relaxes back to its casual, laid back demeanor. There wasn&#39;t exactly a need to be hostile anymore.

     <font color = white>&#34;Can you believe that thing? How crazy!&#34;</font> She suggests, her finger pointing down towards their unconcious state.</font></font></font>

    <font color = white>&#34;My thoughts exact, I&#39;m glad it was settled though. Y&#39;have fun?&#34;</font>, he muttered. 

His gaze unwavering as if he had front-row seats to a boxing match. Even if in reality, this was a <i>squash match</i>, as they do in wrestling federations. Some form of pity was shared for the cold child. However, it was ultimately shrugged off - the <b>did</b> call his cousin <i>&#39;Sharky&#39;</i> after all.

Each fist was tightly clentched, concealing the items sorted within. Immediately responding to the projectile thrown in his direction, The red-headed child executed a juke and spin at the last minute. 

Finding some confidence in his talent, the child sprinted forward with the intent of closing the distance. Responding in a similar manner, his right hand open to reveal tooth picks. Wedging one between his index finger and middle, the flick of the wrist would send the wooden tool towards Najiro's callus feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Aw mehn, Imma have to get this sewn up again&#34;</font> he muttered underneath his breath. Returning his focus back on Najiro, the sprinting child reloaded his hand again with another toothpick. Like done before he&#39;d weaving out of the projectile&#39;s line of fire in a sporatic manner, dodging the incoming tool once more. 

With only a flick of the wrist, another toothpick makeshift senbon was sent through the air, targeting the callus feet once more.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) watched as Najiro panic begin to set in. Closing his distance once more he&#39;d evade the projectile by spinning around and allowing the gord on his back deflect the wooden projectile. Pressed to make every action count, the boy flung another toothpick at his target&#39;s callus feet - this time he&#39;d hope to strike true.

Observing the vulerabilities in Najiro&#39;s form, Afro attempted to capitalized on the situation with a high knee to the face. Assuming it would connect, he prepare for a counter in his blind spot. Taking a defensive stance soon after his foot was grounded.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: EH..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If not,we can continue the fight.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) was mid-swing pause before asking, <font color = white>&#34;So you forfeit the match?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...you can say that too,for now that is.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) Smiled and moved around to gather his wooden toothpicks, however he wouldn&#39;t ask for the one darted into Najiro&#39;s callus foot, that would be disgusting. Turning his around to address the previous suggestion, <font color = white>&#34;Sure I&#39;m down for a travel.&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Hana,wanna come with us?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) glanced down at her feet. While she didn&#39;t wear traditional &#39;shoes&#39;, there were several wraps that kept her soles from constantly touching the ground.

     <font color = white>&#34;These&#39;re good enough. Don&#39;t want to waste ryo on something I&#39;m going to mess up a lot..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Waste ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Are you poor?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Nah. Just would rather spend that money on other things.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Its not a big deal, is it?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If I were to invite you into my office, you would drag dirt everywhere with your unwashed, scummed feet.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your task will be to take someone's shoes. Forcefully.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Failure to do so will result in punishment from myself.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) tapped a finger against her cheek. Not once did the youth consider the &#39;downsides&#39; of her lack of proper footwear. Then again, she never really imagined herself walking into someone&#39;s office. Dirt could always be cleaned, couldn&#39;t it?

     <font color = white>&#34;Well...&#34;</font>

She paused, her eyes scanning the adult. It was the <i>third</i> time someone above her age gave her a command. While the other two resulted in a reward, this one.. It seemed like she didn&#39;t really have a choice. It wasn&#39;t like her to go against the wishes of elder shinobi.

<font color = white>&#34;That sounds kind of easy.&#34;</font> she comments.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) settles both arms behind his back and observes the girl with a scrutinizing glare. <font color = white>&#34;If you make it so,&#34;</font> he starts and pivots to scan the surrounding area, <font color = white>&#34;What is your name? I must make note.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Tsukiko.&#34;</font> she responds plainly. She turns her head, her eyes also glancing about the small gathering of people. Unrecognizable villagers. Passerbys..

But then her eyes catch wind of a certain unmistakable individual.

     <font color = white>&#34;Hey. Short stuff!&#34;</font> she calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) begins a slow departure. <font color = white>&#34;As you were then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ..Of course he falls asleep.

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ...Jeez. You'd think this is the Hidden Blanket village or something.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would slowly turn around as he heard an extra set of footsteps that wasn&#39;t his. The man was covered in all black, looked like he had multiple layers on. When he turned, his entire face was covered by a Red and White Mask. The figure would tilt his head towards the side, before pulling out a book, and what seemed to look like a very fancy pen. Probably the fanciest pen they&#39;ve ever laid eyes on.

The figure would begin to write:

<font color = white>&#34;Is there something you need?&#34;</font> Turning the question, towards them.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) would stare up at the man before them. Their cold black eyes observing the black garmants and odd mask that covered his face. It would be noted by the individual that this child was quite small and innocent looking. They would probably also struggle to determine whether it was a male or female.

<font color = white>&#34;I was just curious about your mask.&#34;</font>, they said with child-like glee, their small child like hand extruding from their kimono sleeve which was clearly a bit too long. 

<font color = white>&#34;Where did you get it? Are you like an assassin or something?&#34;</font>, they inquired</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would straighten his head, rather than have it tilt to the side. Through the mask, he would study the rather small child...they looked frail...they looked cold. The individual would remain silent, never speaking even one word. Even while breathing, it didn&#39;t seem like he was exhaling or inhaling through his mouth. However, he would take back to his book and pen, writing things down once again.

<font color = white>&#34;I recieved this mask many many years ago. It was given to me at first due to the kill orders I was beginning to recieve. Let&#39;s just say...I&#39;ve put too many people in the ground, to where I no longer can show my face for my safety, or for this villages.&#34;</font> After which, the masked man would take for a moment, to look at the sky. Even under the mask, would be another black face-mask, wrapped around his neck, and lower face.

Afterwards, he would take attention back towards the cold child. Writing once more.

<font color = white>&#34;And...what of your jacket? Does it not keep you warm? You look like you&#39;re skin is going to freeze ten times over..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) smiles at the masked individual. Oddly, they would seemingly be unmoved by the mention of the figure before them, in fact being some sort of assassin. A gentle breeze would blow, causing their hair to lightly flutter in the wind.

<font color = white>&#34;This scarf isn&#39;t really meant for keeping me warm...It&#39;s a momento..&#34;</font>, they said, the child-like innocent slightly cracking to reveal a sort of pain beneath. They would exhale slowly, their eyes looking in the direction of the masked figure, but his stare almost seeming as if he was looking through them.

<font color = white>&#34;It must be hard...Not being able to show your face.&#34;</font>, they said, solemnly.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would continue to look at the cold child through his eye slits, he would begin to look up and down slowly at them. Studying their body behavior, before listening to them for a moment. The masked figure would then take to his book and pen once more, before continuing to write.

<font color = white>&#34;At first, it was very hard, but I have grown accustom to this mask. It&#39;s like your scarf, that&#39;s your momento, whereas this is mine. I&#39;ve been wearing this for about Fifteen Years now, and I have never once thought of wanting to show my face.&#34;</font>

He would write, before taking a step closer, in fact, he would bend down to meet with the child&#39;s own height, getting onto one knee. But...even though he was this close, the child still wouldn&#39;t be able to see through the eye slits.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me....what is the momento for? You lose a loved one or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Afro(The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) OOCs: (im I seeing this icly or this is a locked event?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) tilted their head down as the older individual lowered themselves to their height. The slits of the eye mask now level with their own eyes. He would continue to observe the mask, taking mental notes of its intricasies and design.

<font color = white>&#34;Hasn&#39;t everyone lost someone..&#34;</font>, they would say solemnly. His small child-like hand would reach out attempting to touch the mask, if allowed he would simply rest his hand where the cheek would be and speak.

<font color = white>&#34;It has to be awfully lonely. Knowing that when you&#39;re time comes, noone will remember your face. That&#39;s so sad.&#34;</font>, they said, continuing to stare into the masked individuals eye slits.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would tilt his head towards the reaching hand, before quickly raising his own hand to meet it. He would squeeze as hard as he could at first, before softly releasing the pressure, and pushing the arm down. Truly, the masked figure didn&#39;t understand what this sentimental motion was. In fact...he&#39;d tilt his head towards the child, before slowly raising to his feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Most may have lost people, but I am one whose not lost a single soul that they&#39;ve cared for. I put my job before my emotions. To have such emotions...to cry over the dead, is beneath me.&#34;</font> He would show the page once more, before beginning to write even more

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need anyone to remember my face, nor do I crave to show it to anyone here.&#34;</font> He would show towards the child, before looking over at the other kid that had spoken up. Moving to the side, and straightening his head once again, he would remain looking through the eye-slits of his mask. Writing down on a seperate piece of paper.

<font color = white>&#34;This child was asking me qiuestions about my life. Nothing more, nothing less. Is there something you need?&#34;</font> He would flash the parchment towards the red-headed child.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) draws in closer and observes the masked figure unsure as to what was developing. <font color = white>&#34;Eh... is everyone okay over here? He asked towards his fellow village-man.&#34;</font> 

Afro arrived too late to overhear the conversation but would make note of the figure&#39;s attire.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Hmm... are you a member of the village military?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) feels his hand get grabbed as he attempted to touch the man&#39;s mask. In the next instant, he would feel his hand being squeezed almost to the point of being crushed by the older man though just as quickly as the pressure was applied, it would softly released.

<font color = white>&#34;Ow!&#34;</font>, he yelled out, holding his hand with his other non-squeezed hand, examining it, as a purple and bluish bruise appeared. It did not take much, as he was clearly quite frail.

<font color = white>&#34;Well...That wasn&#39;t very nice.&#34;</font>, he said, as he continued rubbing his bruised hand. <font color = white>&#34;You must not have any friends if that is how you act. No need to be so harsh mask guy.&#34;</font>, they said, their cold exterior quickly overtaking the moment of surprise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) took note of the passive force displayed and waited for a response, though he was young, the academy student was well aware all intel whether big or small was vital when formulating a course of action. However, he thought it was pretty childish and naive to approach such a towering figure un-armed, especially in the blood-thirsty ninja world. 

Thought: <b>Maybe this is the perfect time to ask</b>

<font color = white>&#34;If you are indeed a shinobi of the village, would you be willing to take me on as a student? I would vow never to speak of your existance nor pesture you for your mentorship.&#34;</font> 

Afro intent was truly to learn the way of the shinobi. 

<font color = white>&#34;As a token of our arrangement would you willing to gift me a single kunai with your engraving?&#34;</font>

Should the figure accept, Afro&#39;s journey as a shinobi would begin. Creating a storyline far different from those in the limelight. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would look toward the afro haired child, before nodding at his question. The masked individual had multiple layers on which made it very difficult to see any skin on his body. The only noticeable thing would be his white spikey hair. Other than that...there was no hint as to what he looked like. He would once again take to his book and his pen.

<font color = white>&#34;I will not apologize for the bruise that has formed on your arm. You would be the same, if you have lived the life I have been through. Spies within your own village from another, trying to find the person they are looking for, just so they can finally be rid of Amegakure&#39;s Executioner.&#34;</font>

His visage would look towards the afro kid, before shaking his head no. Once again, taking to another page of the book and writing down again.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not take students, personally. But...that does not mean I will not be making sure you all are in tip-top shape to take the lives of our enemies. Perhaps, if one of you proves yourself within the coming year or two, I will change my mind, Just know...I will be watching and paying attention to your growth. A of current, it is too early to decide if any of you are worth my time to personally oversee your training and abilities.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) holds up his small blue and purple hand which is obviously bruised from nearly being crushed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With that guidance, the girl bursts onto the scene of gathered individuals. She steps forward, her height in stark contrast to the masked individual. The contents of their conversation don&#39;t even register in her mind. Throughout that group, only one youth gains the attention and ire of the blonde&#39;s sunset-colored iris.

     <font color = white>&#34;<b>Runt!</b> We&#39;ve still got a score to settle!&#34;</font>

One hand moves to her own hip. The other extends outward, a dedicated point thrust right towards the cold one&#39;s face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) Took note of the figures words and recorded his title as <b>Amekagure Executioner</b>

Squinting his eyes he&#39;d respond, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be sure to rise up to the occation and claim the position... I to will become a shadow of the village&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid-sentence when he hears a familiar screech. Quickly hiding his hand back in his kimono sleeve. He would look over to the blonde haired hag from the other day.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh no.&#34;</font>, he thought, slowly moving backwards away from the girl, his cold eyes intently locked onto her.

<font color = white>&#34;You stay away from me, ha-....Lady..&#34;</font>, he said coldly. Best not to antagonize one with such monstrous strength.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Should be fine, Naji'.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;No can do!&#34;</font>

Even the mentions and quick brandish of his injured hand don&#39;t phase her or halt her approach. Once more, that invisible spark of tension radiates from her eyes as the two lock their gazes. Her target had already been set.

     <font color = white>&#34;Executive orders, short-stuff. Hand over your shoes!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: What she said. Would rather strong-arm them from you than one of my cousins.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would hear some rather newer voices, one&#39;s he hasn&#39;t even seen or met yet. It had seemed the village was bursting with energy, but...he didnt care for the commotion in which was going on. He didn&#39;t turn his visage towards anyone, in fact, he was focused on one thing and one thing only. The destroyed village that was currently needing to be Reconstructed. So, the masked figure would push his way through the younger generation, giving them no time of day.

He had decided, to be done with conversing for now, especially while there was work to be done. The book and pen, would be placed within his equipment. Before he would finally speak, a low and dark voice would come out of his mask.

<font color = white>&#34;If you wish to fight each other over some trivial matter...then proceed.

But, if you wish to show me your value and worth to the village...then it&#39;s time to put your actions where your mouth is. In but a few moments, I am going to begin Reconstructing our Bridge that was blown up by those damn Dakuteika heathens.

So, either help...or get out of my sight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Her hands moved from their pointing, relaxed positions and instead dropped to her side. Just like the day(s) prior, they slowly began to curl themselves into fists. She took a singular step forward, the wraps around her soles pressing against the concrete.

     <font color = white>&#34;Just don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you an out, runt!&#34;</font>

It takes only a jolt for her to take off into a full fledged sprint. Step after step is made in dangerous approach of the youthful one. With her target locked, there wasn&#39;t exactly anything going to stop her from making her way over to them.

Just how would they respond?</font></font></font>

Continuing to move back towards the bridge. They would scan their environment looking for a way to defend themselves from the encroaching assault.

<font color = white>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just go away and leave me alone.&#34;</font>, he said, continuing his retreat.</font></font></font>

The masked figure didn&#39;t even move his arm upwards to take the cloth. Instead, he would look straight through the sole of the Uzumaki.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need a piece of cloth to summon you. If I find myself in need, I will take The Commander above a Student. Like I have said before...I am watching you all.

<font color = white>&#34;I won&#39;t be bullied by some hag!&#34;</font>, he said defiantly, attempting to weave a set of handseals. If successful, two clones of the child would appear in a puff of smoke on each side of him.  Though they would not move, as if all were frozen in place with fear of the impending strikes.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) That gap between them closes in mere moments. She nigh skids before them, her clearly experienced hands already working at her side. Initially, the entire ordeal was something she only did out of demand and fear or reprimandation. A violently, horrific word slams into her ears. It was the same word that caused the situation from last night. It was the same word that powered up those dangerous fists of hers.

And it would be the same word that solidified the amount of damage she&#39;d inflict upon the cold youth.

As his hands come together to formulate those seals, one of her own mixes between the two to slap them out of order. There wouldn&#39;t be a puff of smoke or any clones-- only the fiery wrath of the blonde as she forcibly entered his space. 

     <font color = white>&#34;<i>Sabrosa!</i>&#34;</font>

Her other hand extended downward, a violent push aimed towards the youth&#39;s face to shove him into the ground. Excessive, sure.. but he&#39;d certainly asked for it.

His face would widen with horror, as he braced himself knowing full well what would come next. 

Before he could process the next movement, a hand would grab the top of his head, causing his face to slam into the concrete with a violent force. The blood curdling scream of a child would erupt from him, as the stern concrete mashed the soft bits of his facial flesh with his skull.

He would lay there severly bruised with blood leaking down their small forehead. He would feebly raise his arms to the ground attempting to before passing into unconciousness. Though in the instant before he would curl into a fetal position grasping his shoes with all his strength even in his unconscious state.

She stood above him, her hands still twitching with the anticipation of more. Clearly, their last exchange of blows didn&#39;t teach the cold one anything.

Fortunately, despite this rage, she wasn&#39;t some sort of psychopath.

Those jittering palms made their way to the cold youth&#39;s shoes. That cry and the surrounding blood were, yet again, idly ignored as she took to reaching down towards those shoes. Clutch as much as they&#39;d like, she pulled and pried those two straight from his feet.

With them in tow, she took to holding them both with a singular hand; her index and middle finger capable of hoisting them up. She immediately about faces, her attention already upon the instructor of said punishment.

She noted blood, blood touching her pavement - ruining her street and it caused her to briefly chuckle. 

   <font color = white>&#34;As stated before, anything done to the village will be applied to you - and I see blood on the street,&#34;</font>

Even in the view of a higher-up, she didn&#39;t truly care and suddenly she moved to curve her hand around and lurch a singular fist towards the stomach of the Student. It wasn&#39;t designed to inflict injuries, just a subtle method to ensure they remember.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) All in all, the blonde believed everything to be handled. She had obtained her mission objective; the small one had been punished for their injuries. All was <i>mostly</i> right with her world.

    <font color = white>&#34;See that, Beisame? That&#39;s how you--&#34;</font>

Unfortunately, that lock onto familiar faces cost her. Before she could even finish her sentence or identify the attack, a devastating shot rocked the tanned one&#39;s midsection. She immediatly lurched forward, her grip upon the boy&#39;s sandals <i>nearly</i> releasing from that shot of pain.

All of the energy within her body was forcefully knocked out of her. She nigh crumbled just from that singular strike alone-- forced to shaky knees. If the dancer wasn&#39;t holding back, it was certain that the blonde would have been reduced to the same unconcious state that she left the cold youth.

     <font color = white>&#34;W-Wait.. I-I&#39;m..&#34;</font> She tried to speak.. but that fresh damage made it impossible to formulate a sentence. Pained, weakened eyes mixed with her expression to convey a message;

Regret.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had already shifted, and turned in place - agile grace, and practiced movements could be noted while her hands instantly moved behind her back and furled into a locked grasp. 

She seemed as if nothing had occured. 

   <font color = white>&#34;When you can stand again, please do ensure that blood is cleaned up - and try not to let the Yuki die,&#34;</font>

The soft thuds of bare-feet with trimmed cloth could be noted while she eased back to her original location. She had finished what she needed to finish.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) throughout the use of the convienient diversion made by the higher up, Nahoko approached the profound blonde and looked down at her.
   Slowly, yet surely the girl bent over and grasped at the blonde's sandals. Without making much sound she attempted to yank the smelly things free of her feet before taking off like a bullet in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) remains unconscious and bleeding on the street. His blood pooling from the wound on his head into a crimson puddle of savagery and regret around him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (blonde-hair, I like her style.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (Ame may have less people but we are fiesty.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (even had flashbacks of him handing her stacks of money to buy stuff.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) wasted no time approaching his friend. As he noticed the girl with blonde hair grasping the sandals of his good friend. Jinbeisame was not one to sit idly by as his friends were getting messed with. In such, the boy closed the distance from his previous position to the girl with blonde-hairs side.

The blue-scaled hand of the Hoshigaki grasping their wrist with somewhat decent strength. No where near his friends - but enough. With a face as dead-pan as the Uzumaki behind him, he began speaking.
      <font color = white>&#34;Relinquish your hold on my friend.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Flies flew out of his ryo pouch.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I can respect that, but I can't respect it happening to my friend.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You people are truly disgsting.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That Yuki boy seems plentiful.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Leave the female alone..
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: She doesn't need you as a white knight.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Eh? White knight? 
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Talking to Najwhatever.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Who said im a white knight
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Ah, him.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I forgot he was 'ere.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I simply do not respect your decisions.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: I didn't catch your name Shark fella.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Jinbeisame, or 'Beisame', as my friend here calls me.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: I'm Nahoko.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: A pleasure, may we both line our pockets plentiful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) To say she was unconcious was an overstatement. She might not have been standing upright but she <i>was</i> sentient of her surroundings. As that hand reached towards her mission objective, her hand instinctively came down towards her torso where she clutched the two sandals.

     <font color = white>&#34;H-Hands.. off..&#34;</font> she called out as she slowly managed to rise to a standing position. Still dazed, she took note of <i>yet another</i> elder who brandished their prowess and power. Unfortunately, the blonde wasn&#39;t in any state to argue. She gave only a slow nod of understanding whilst her free hand nursed the freshly inflicted blow to her core.

     <font color = white>&#34;S-Shouldn&#39;t.. the so-called &#39;medic&#39; be helping this guy out..?&#34;</font> she inquired, her half-wrapped foot gesturing towards the Yuki covered in blood.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sure..but the most i can do is basic treatment.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would approach the scene as they went closer to the Yuki,first thing was to expect closer the unconcious person and act accordingly to it.He knew clearly they were not dead,but firstly he needed to locate where was their injury.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: But.. before I do anything else..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (if want you can rp where your body is hit and what type of injury it is
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) lies face-down unconcious like a stray dog in the street, a bright red pool of bled encircling them. It would be clear to anyone who inspected the seen that the majority of the blood seemed to be focused around the head of the young child.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (i gotchu gang

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turned <i>again</i>. Hopefully this time, a punch wouldn&#39;t fill her palette.

     <font color = white>&#34;Commander. Do I just.. give these back to them later?&#34;</font> she inquired. Despite the question, it was <i>quite</i> obvious she had no intentions or desire to do so.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Head injuries can be severe, I would locate the hospital.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (which I think is bugged atm.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at the injury,clearly it was a head trauma causing this.He will grab from his bag a cloth and begin to wipe the blood off the head injury.After the blood was cleaned to the point he can see where was coming off excactly they will get medicine that will disinfect the place and pour it to a small piece of fiber.As they disinfect the wound the next step will come into place.

He will grab two small bandaids,then place a fabric to the wound and keep it with the two bandaids.After the treatment was done he will simply wait for the unconcious person to awake,afterall he did what he can with his basic knowledge of the human body</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The big jefe-Kristuria) made his way to the edge of the bridge. The &#39;ole worker got down on a knee and closely inspected the finish on the dried concrete.
   <font color = white>&#34;Kids didnt do half bad. I&#39;d hire them on part time...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: this will do untill they visit the hospital..
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Very well, I'm off on my walk.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Laaaaater~.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: If that man requires people to assist him in building anything? Do feel free to do so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Aye, aye, cap'n!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The big jefe-Kristuria) looks at the defeated kid for a moment before bursting out laughing.
   <font color = white>&#34;HAHAHA HE LOOKS LIKE HE GOT INTO A FIGHT WITH A JUMPING JACK!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (these fucking ECs are Torizuka

<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The big jefe-Kristuria) says: I better get to going. I gotta make deadline.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do not disrespect their injuries..
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Heh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly rouses from their slumber, a sharp stabbing pain emanating from the wound on their head. Shaking their head and attempting to get their bearings, they would stare up at Rose whom they assumed had just bandaged their wound.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you...&#34;</font>, they said, staring at the blonde who had attacked him. There would be an ominous look in their eyes something that most in this village would be all too familiar with. Vengeance.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) whispers: One day...One day Ill be strong...And I'll teach her a lesson..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: No. Wear them.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: W--
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Eww. She gonna get fungus.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) glanced between the male and the shoes. They were <i>certainly</i> too small for her to wear.

     <font color = white>&#34;I.. don&#39;t think they&#39;ll fit me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Then it seems you worked for the wrong result.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (why im called rose XD
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: hm...cannot you buy shoes instead?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: They won't make me a better shinobi..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: They will keep your dirty feet from dirtying my office. Didn't I say this already?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Well, yes.. But I'll just carry a spare-pair for when that time comes!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: .....i didn't know better shinobi beats their comrades unconcious over shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Better shinobi follow orders. I didn't think they'd get knocked out that easily.. and they could have just handed them over!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: If he told you to beat all of us,would you do it?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I'd expect such.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Wouldn't exactly have fun doin' it.. but yeah. I don't *want* to try and punch Beisame.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: You would disobey an order from your Commander?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Going against the grain isn't smart..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Comrades are worth more than a order.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Incorrect.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: And they say my clan were the Ice-cold monsters.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you don't value the life of others you are just a scum.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think anyone said they don't...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) sets his hands behind his waist and studies the lot of them. So emotional. <font color = white>&#34;If you are willing to disobey orders then you will <i>never</i> be gifted a headband from me. You&#39;re expelled from the academy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Nahoko. Come to me.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Wrong name uzumaki.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Their name is not Nahoko.The one you ordered that is.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) lifts a brow. <font color = white>&#34;I know who I&#39;m speaking to and you will call me Commander.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) nodded in response. Just as she was asked, she trot over towards the elder shinobi.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You're not Nahoko.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You are Tsukiko.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...thats Hana.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sits rubbing the wound on their head observing the commotion unfurling before him. This child who had healed him had quite the gumption to be backtalking the commander the way he was.

However, he could not help but hope nothing bad befell him. He had healed him when others chose to make a victim of him. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) coughed. Her intuition betrayed her.

     <font color = white>&#34;R-Right. Sorry about that, Commander. That punch, you know? Think it knocked around more than just my lunch.&#34;</font> She followed with a dry chuckle-- a rather poor attempt at playing off the situation.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Tell that boy your name.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Tsukiko. Hana's my family bearing.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: H-hhm? My fault I dazed off.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) looks to Tsukiko then to the black-haired male. <font color = white>&#34;Now. Anything else you wish to say before I confirm your expulsion?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: i can say more,but why should i.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You are learning.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I will explain this once.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Finally...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko(The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) OOCs: (Back)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) shook out of her daze and approached the Commander at his behest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) pulls out a single hand, gesturing towards Tsukiko and her shark-kin companion. <font color = white>&#34;If you can not follow simple orders then you are of no use. What if who you think to be your comrade is actually a mole? A mole only I know of. You would ruin an entire mission and operation. Can you handle that much? From the looks, I can&#39;t tell.&#34;</font>

He peers over to Nahoko.

<font color = white>&#34;Nahoko has good comprehensing skill.&#34;</font> He gestures toward her now. <font color = white>&#34;If I told you to attack Tsukiko right now. What is expected of you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) looked to her left, her gaze surverying those present.
    <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d figure out who Tsukiko is and attack them. Hesitation to follow an order can be the difference between a won and lost battle.&#34;</font> 

   The girl recalled her previous conversation with the Commander where he&#39;d drilled home the same point.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Well said.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess i will blindly follow orders then
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) fans the air dismissively. <font color = white>&#34;Yes. Yes, you shall. I will retract the expulsion.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and places their aching head in their hands. They did not like this lesson very much. This Uzumaki Commander was just as vicious as his elders had warned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Glad yer catching on now, Naji'.
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Like I spoke of earlier, this is no world of rainbow and sunshines
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yeah, its a world of older people beating on younger people because they know they can.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: One day, the roles will reverse.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is entirely untrue.
<br><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...sure..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) points to the ground in front of him. <font color = white>&#34;Come to me.&#34;</font> he says, both eyes locked onto the young Yuki.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) weakly gets to his feet, his legs wobbling beneath him. His equilabrium was still shaky following the vicious blow to his head. His eyes would lock onto the hag who had assaulted him for a second time, as he approached the commander. 

The small child would radiate an aura of hatred towards the fellow villager. In his mind plans and ruminations of vengeance against her already had begun to take hold.

He would carefully approach the red haired commander, staring up at him with their small stature.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes....Sir..&#34;</font>, he said, begrudgingly knowing that this man&#39;s order was the reason that he had been so viciously assaulted and beaten.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You were targeted and beaten.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: How do you feel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Well my head hurts and I want to pay that ha...girl back.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) visibly twitches.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You have potential.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Potential?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your shoes are in their grasp forever. After graduation, you are to take them back.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How am I suppose to do that? She hits like a professional sumo wrestler.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm too small..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Figure it out.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Did he just call her a sumo wrestler...?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Do not become complacent.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep trying.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Just get bigger.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'll pay her back one day, no longer how long it takes.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep burning in the furnace that is my command until you've become something worthy of being made a blade.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Am I understood?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yes...Sir...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Sumo..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Enough of this weak persona. Shed it thoroughly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pinched at her own waist. She wasn't fat...

...was she?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You may leave.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) bows respectfully not wanting to be party to another beating. There was something about this elder man that unsettled him. His senses screamed at him to not anger this man, although he had not done or said anything outwardly hostile. It was just a feeling that he could not shake.

Turning to leave, he would glare at the profound blonde. His cold icy anger boiling over as he observed his shoes in her grasp. He would look down at his cold pale feet which were covered in dirt, as he grasped his fists and trembled.

<font color = white>&#34;You will pay...&#34;</font> ,he thought, as he walked around the 2 savages and stood next to Rose.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (why everyone calls me rose XD
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Weird stuff... Weird stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Tsukiko, you will do everything in your ability to keep those shoes from his grasp.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Another battle between you two will commence upon graduation.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ngl,hopefully admins allow resets of stats.I feel that me being 12 and turning into 13 gonna screw me up XD
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Oyi, what am I mission out now?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (could try GM-H'ing and asking @najiro)
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Right. Though, I have to ask..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (think to suggest that in disc to see if they like the idea XD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) When the Yuki walks past her, Tsukiko only gives him an arched eyebrow. What <i>would</i> convey confusion invites something else. A dare, almost, for them to try their luck once more.

     <font color = white>&#34;When they lose then.. What happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: It will happen again and again until you lose.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I'm off. Cease your battles in my absence.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Aye, aye.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: That.. sounds like it'll be annoying.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yeaaah, very tedious.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....this is so stupid
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: What even happened
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than the higher ups want us to be brainless
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: noting else.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Brainless?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: You still don't get it, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think he ever will.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I get we shouldn't question what we do
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But i rather question why shall i kill someone from our village if im not given enough information
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Because it's an order.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think anyone said anything about doin' that.. but you'd just do it because you were told to. Its not that complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: See...thats my issue.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Precisely.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There needs to be a reason
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's what's bein' a Shinobi is about.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: There is a reason.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: They said so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Picture this; Red Commander tells Beisame to kiss you. I don't think he'd want to do it at all.. but an order is an order!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess you will realize it later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If he tries to kiss me i will kick them in the croutch
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Why is it always weird around here?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Kinda confused as to what really happened here
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Eh? I'm not kissing no man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: But that's Big Red
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko(The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) OOCs: (omit o god)

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Well, if it's a order, nevermind.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: It's just getting weirder...

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ..I think your brain broke on that one.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Don't think too much on th'subject, Naji'.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You are the people who love to hit eachother on the head,not me.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yaaaaawn. Don't dwell on such things.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't know about 'love'. I only did it because they kept callin' me old.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I will be honest

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s body jerks forward as the veteran&#39;s fist slams into his stomach with brutal force. The impact sends a shockwave of pain through him, causing him to grit his teeth and stagger backward. His hands instinctively clutch at his abdomen, trying to alleviate the intense ache that spreads from the point of impact.

Despite the pain, Sogeki locks eyes with the crimson-haired veteran, his gaze unwavering. His pride refuses to let him show weakness or back down, even in the face of such a harsh lesson. He takes a deep breath, swallowing his pride along with the pain, and straightens up slowly, though the discomfort is evident on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand,&#34;</font> Sogeki manages to say through clenched teeth, his voice strained but defiant. He exhales sharply, willing himself to remain composed despite the throbbing pain in his gut. His eyes remain fixed on the veteran, a silent acknowledgment of the respect he holds for the commander&#39;s authority.</font></font></font>

When he walked back over, she observed his demeanor and that call he made-- She, too, widened her eyes with shock. Not one ounce of her wanted to imagine what that felt like. 

Before she could offer a hand or deliver his justice..

He was gone.

    His arm sliding out of his sleeve as his upper body laid bare. Turning southbound to face Sogeki. The student granted the privilege of hunting and punching him. This was perfectly fine to him.

The neck of his cracked as he readied himself. His right hand raising itself, motioning in a &#39;<i>come on, then</i>&#39; gesture. Thus he spoke finally.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Hunt me? Fine then, let&#39;s do it. Punch me? Do it..</b>&#34;</font>, his finger pointed in Najiro&#39;s direction, his face grinning widely as he continued.

        Moving along to the side, letting the next recipient take their turn in receiving the punch from the fellow student, Sogeki.
