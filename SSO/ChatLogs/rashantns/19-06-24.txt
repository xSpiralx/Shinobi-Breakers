<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Is all you people do is fight?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: No. I train too.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: "is all you do" is sit on your ass?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) turns their head to look in Sogeki's direction, their eyes looking the older child over. He would sigh before pulling his eye down and sticking his tongue out at the older child.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) couldn&#39;t care less about the nerds reaction to the truth-- as long as the truth was spoken. Sogeki pockets both hands and shifts his gaze from person to person as they approached him.

In the back of the Satetsu mind, the thought of the hunt still lingers. He pays close attention, refusing to allow anyone that isn&#39;t on the list too close.
   <font color = white>&#34;..mmm,&#34;</font> He grumbles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: You know I thought village mates were suppose to be..I dont know..Nicer to each other.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: All people do around here is beat each other up.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: That is the best way to be nice to one another. We train, spar and grow with one another.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: We learn each other habits.. then we dominate and eliminate any and all krakens.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Sadly.. you're starting to sound like a kraken yourself.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Kraken?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: What is a kraken?

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its his way to say you enemyy
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: It sounds like a compliment
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Why can't there be any normal kids in this village.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Everyone's all edgy and weird.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Although being a kraken sounds kind of cool.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Not about being edgy. At least I don't consider myself that. I just don't like people that sit around and act like we're not more than just kids playing ninja.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: We are literally around the corner from graduation.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Get off your butt.. and I don't know.. train?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Who says I havent been training?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Y'all act like this is some slice of life manga..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: You just met me.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I just don't train ALL the time, jerk.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: So
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: You're complaining about us wanting to fight. So that implies that, even if you do train, it's the bare minimum. You're judging us for doing what we wish to do.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Najiro I heard you were having a duel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Part of being a ninja is knowing your friends, as more than just fighting machines.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: What better way to bond that battle and converse?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: You act like conversations dont happen prior, during, and post spar.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How about starting with a conversation? The first thing you said was let's fight.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not going to explain basic manners to a meat head.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: So you're angry about my conversation starter?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I do
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Angry? No, not really.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Cause we're conversing now. Are you satisfied enough to fight me?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Nothing to be angry about.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Have you decided yet?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Then what is your issue?
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: I already know who they have
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will fight you in one weeks time.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm working on a new technique.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Right now, you'd probably beat me, so it's a waste of both of our time.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I'm simply trying to understand your logic. Throwing hands isn't necessary. But I accept the challenge.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: Najiro i'll fight on your side if you'll have me
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: You said that all we do is fight, I say that fighting is our way to bond. Then you said we don't even converse prior to battle, I said we converse before, during, and after.. So what exactly is your issue with folks that actually like to hone their skills through consistent sparring?
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: If you're not doing it, don't expect others
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: That's why people have teams
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I as well, Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: If we go into battle, its a stronger motivator to know and care for the person beside you.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm...sure Chizu.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Najiro do you need throwing weapons at all?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I don't know your hopes, your dreams, or aspirations. I barely know your name, yet we expect to operate as cohesive units when we face our enemies.

  <font color = white>&#34;..truthfully, you have a point. A lot of the issues you just brought up is tackled in sparring. The connection, the trust, the laughs, the shame, the pride, the motivation-- all of it. All of it is established during sparring-- whether you want to believe it or not.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not in clan.

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Depends.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Will you buy me shoes?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I'll only allow rich, cute girls to get close. Anyone else will have to fight me.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Sure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) turns their gaze back to the individual across the park. Their small child-like eyes locking onto Sogeki&#39;s. Their words were not meant as insults but rather a lesson. A lesson that his clan had been taught in blood and destruction.

<font color = white>&#34;I..I just don&#39;t want to see any of you die because we focused so much on fighting that we forget we are people. My clan were amazing warriors, yet they failed to understand that building bonds is what makes a unit strong...And so we were nearly wiped off of the planet.&#34;</font>, he said solemnly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: Sogeki, I didn't know you had this side to you, interesting.

  <font color = white>&#34;What your clan went through is understandable. Your sentiments are understandable as well. I can not blame you for prioritizing the things you do.. But allow us to bond the way we like, and you bond the way you like. That doesn&#39;t mean our two worlds can&#39;t coexist..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) rolls over in the grass. All this yapping in the backgrouind was ruining his beauty sleep.</font></font></font>

A brief twist of movement could be noted; and she vanished into a blinding blur of immense speed and raw agility. She appeared directly before him, and looked down towards him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You do, yes,&#34;</font>

A fist was launched directly towards his stomach - she didn&#39;t care about the back-talk but this man has ushered forth something previously, and she had to repay the kind for what he had done. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You threw a rock at my cat,&#34;</font>

Without hesitation he reacts by headbutt=ing his head in to the fist to take on even greater force of the strike.
(Damage Cap raised to Critical)

Sending himself flying back off the contact and then splashing in to the water. A familiar sensation. Though last time he enjoyed flying higher in the air. For a moment he was under the water and eventually surfaced.

His pair of shirts was missing and he lacked shoes. Quite literally punched right out of his clothing.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh. The PAIN!&#34;</font>
Gripping his chest as many tears began to shed. Now floating on top of the water as he swayed around at its will.

He would then simply jump into the water, swimming over to the injured boy and grabbing him by his underarms, then proceeding to use a half back stroke to swim back to the edge of the water and pull both himself and the boy out of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp... Anybody wanna take him to the hospital?&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t seem too thrilled on the aspect of transporting blast to the hospital so he hoped somebody else could do it.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;They&#39;ll put me further in to the system. Can&#39;t have that.&#34;</font>
Grabbing hold of that thread a bit tighter and forcing himself to withstand the crucial pain from the recent assault.

<font color = white>&#34;You are a good guy. Stay that way.&#34;</font>
Giving him a thumbs up along with a smile that went with it.

<font color = white>&#34;Well... Okay then, no problem.&#34;</font>

He would return the thumbs up and then look around for the boy&#39;s clothes which may have ended up being washed away in the water.

He would duck down to narrowly avoid the sword from cutting his head off. Immediately he would realise that standing in a line like this was not a good idea. He would rush forward and approach the man from behind.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay... Not as much of a chump as a I thought.&#34;</font>

He would then continue to send a simple kick to the back of the man&#39;s knees in an attempt to get him off balance.

Annoyed at getting hit by the Yakuzaurai he would rush towards him and attempt to grab him and hold him. 

<font color = white>&#34;I GOT YU NOW!!!&#34;</font> he&#39;d exclaim as he was trying to hold him.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) opened his eyes wide. This man was near leagues above them all. With barely enough time to simply <i>raise his defenses</i>. With his face shifting into one of pure grit and determination, his hands pressed onto the floor after his block - sending his body forwards as he allies hit him from the sides.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m takin&#39; that blade from ya&#39;, one way, <b><i>OR ANOTHER..!&#34;</font>, he spoke as he sprung himself forward.

His hands facing the earth as he flipped over for a kick to the head. Matching his allies kick to the knees in the form of a </i>combination hit.<i>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9a364d>Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) gripped the tanto in his right hand tight as he braced for the swing coming towards him. Jumping back just in time, the sweep of the blade would narrowly miss cutting him open.

He would glare, taking three more shuriken from his scarf.

Once again, Chizu would throw the shurikens towards the ragged man, the three shriken zooming in towards the pompadour man.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) smirked. He had managed to land a solid blow against one; if it wasn&#39;t for the fact his head was currently screaming at him he could have added more back into that blow. 

He was starting to get himself into an adjustment; and as they all motioned to surround him and thus engage him once more? He was ready; a brief flash of movement, and he twisted about nearing a half-step leap upwards. 

Those blows creaked along below him. Those arms attempting to grasp him, and those Shuriken seemly curved along. They were about to crash into each other, and that simply aided him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Oh?! Its time to put my back into it!,&#34;</font>

A shift of his body; he was floating albeit briefly - the world coaxed into a near halt, and suddenly he dropped his arm forth and the length of steel seemed to coax along the air. 

A brief eruption of sparks fluttering into view, and suddenly an explosion of intense HEAT! OH MY WHAT WAS THIS?! He was starting to glow; an AURA began to flare up. He had begun to build up his HEAT BAR!

   <font color = white>&#34;OHHHHH YAH! ITO STYLE SUPER INTENSE FLAME CUT!,&#34;</font>

That heat erupted into a brief X along the ground, and then BOOM! He landed nearby.
