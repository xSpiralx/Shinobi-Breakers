He inches closer... Aiming to swipe at her blade the moment he's there.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) yells: I already gave you your 1 ryo back!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: I paid it back before the day.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'll prove it to you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) would cross both arms ahead of herself as she watched the intense youth talking down upon the bright one. There was a growing smile of amusement which tugged at the corners of her lips.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know about you calling to everyone,&#34;</font> she directs to the redhead, <font color = white>&#34;I know I&#39;m above academy standards. I already know how to perform stuff,&#34;</font> she bragged.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A challenge?!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Of course I accept!

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Oh! 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: A match already?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I want to learn as many jutsu as possible, but I don't want to slack in other areas either.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) wipes an imaginary tear from her eye.
A budding rivalry! What <i>youth!</i></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I guess I'll start out as a generalist.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Huh? Someone's getting beaten with a spoon?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: A generalist.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Very cool! 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm gonna be a medical ninja!
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: What about you?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Really?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I bet I have really good chakra control.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Are you sure you want to try that?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You don't hear that often.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Sakuya Senju (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya rises from the wooden park bench, feeling the muscles in her back and arms unfurl like blossoms greeting the morning sun. She stretches her arms high above her head, her fingers reaching toward the overcast sky, as if trying to touch the clouds. 

"I should make friends now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: No, I'm just kidding.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: HA HA HA.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) extends her hand with a blaring smile. <font color = white>&#34;Shake on it!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I'm gonna be a taijutsu specialist.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I was gonna say..You don't look that impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: What!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Look at me!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Ah, right. I'll add that in. I forgot medical shinobi were a thing, SINCE I NEVER NEEDED TO SEE THEM.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Kohaku Uchiha (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) smiled seems he was the youngest here, although he was more dressed in incredibly formal attire.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Uchiha, Kohaku- I feel out of place being so young, So Yuuto and Batsu, both kin... I bet we will pass with flying colors then.&#34;</font> He held himself with a standard about him, confident but not one to hide the fact he was still rather shy. if one couldn&#39;t be true to themselves then how could one call themselves an Uchiha? 

He&#39;d whip out a fan from his sleeve shaped like the symbol of their clan to cool himself, <font color = white>&#34;I just hope everyone shows promise this year, in and out of the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) squints and tries to examine Might Try. He looks rather...Plain.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) nods firmly a couple of times, as his gaze focuses upon Hinoue before he reaches for Shishorama's hand, attempting a firm squeeze..!

Alas, he did not possess Senju strength. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: There you go, it should be there now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) was the living embodiment of masculinity, power, and excellent taste in fashion.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You....are kind of weird.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) took out a marker and quickly added 'Medical Nin" Into the options of specs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Guhhhhh...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) sagged, defeated and deflated. He took a breath through his wide, flared nostrils, then turned and looked over his shoulder as intensely and confidently as possible, flashing a cheeky grin and batting his thickly lashed eyes while smirking devilishly. A thumbs up rocketed towards Raihara.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Thanks for your support!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) pauses for a moment, does she not notice him...? This lady&#39;s a Shinobi, no? If so, then she should be able to realize her precious weapon is about to be swiped away from her at any given moment! Shun&#39;Ichi hesitates, turning over toward his sister once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, that girl&#39;s a Shininijobi or whatever, right?&#34;</font> He aims to clarify, since Sakuya&#39;s been outside longer than he has, perhaps she was present whenever Komo demonstrated some sense of skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: Never needed one? You're tha strong?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t seem to care about the formal attire of his cousin, not even their young age. It should be pretty standard for Uchiha&#39;s to have some geniuses every now and then, and he was curious as to what Kohaku was capable of.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh trust me, I spotted quite a few promising... if not interesting, people already.&#34;</font> If both Kohaku and Batsu followed his gaze, they would see him glancing at Might, Try and then at both Hajime and Shishorama talking near the police officer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) eyes did not change from his normal blank, bored expression. Was this some kind of prank? His cold black eyes merely looked at Try, unblinking.

<font color = white>&#34;Support? Uh...Are you feeling okay?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: OH YEAH!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: ou're not that strong are you?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Never better Raihara. Why?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Yes, legends of the village would say I have a hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Cuz today starts our shinobi adventure! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) delicately shakes his hand with the appropriate amount of strength. She took great care not to actually harm her future comrades and classmates. It was her duty to protect those weaker than her, and she&#39;d uphold that belief until the bitter end.

<font color = white>&#34;When I win, I&#39;ll treat you to some food after.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: No reason...Nevermind it.
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: It looks like it.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: We should meet some of the other students.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) Kohaku didn&#39;t look much younger than Batsu, wondering just what he meant by feeling out of place. It felt natural for the Uchiha himself to finally become apart of the academy after the years of waiting. He&#39;d nod toward his clan member though, a head nod that usually gestures a greeting.

The statement about passing though the academy would resonate with him though, he&#39;d already expected the academy to be something he could easily maintain as his parents had made him study for as long as he could remember.

<font color = white>&#34;Pleasure to meet you Kohaku and yes... We will indeed exceed in this years academy.&#34;</font> he said, smirking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: But there are so many.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) asks: Do you want to have a hard ass head too? Or you just wanting to give it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) clicked her tongue, and idly produced a book from within her garment. Adding a pen to the mix, she began to scribble down on a seemingly blank page. Mysteries upon mysteries were written, surely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Well, I can introduce you to a few.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hummm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) scoffed at the declaration that he&#39;d beat herself and the other one. So, she did what anyone else in her position would. Push his buttons even harder.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... I&#39;ll just verbally agree to beat you then, I wouldn&#39;t want to touch your hand...&#34;</font> Her nose upturns just a tad, as though she would have caught something being too close to him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) stepped up to Kohaku and put his fists on his hips as he stared intently at the Uchiha trio just... breathing... waiting.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Already making friends?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (dont mind my fists on your hips)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stands behind Try, his cold eyes just examining the three students before him. He would not make any introductions.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Medical Nin are quite excellent at giving hard ass he-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) reachs out and touches Shun&#39;Ichi green hair without permission. <font color = white>&#34;Is this natural?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) covers her mouth... She forgot she was with children.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had no idea that he had been held back on.

He simply figured that despite being part of the Senju, she was a girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;No way. I don&#39;t accept hand outs.&#34;</font> 

Despite Hinoue&#39;s clear reluctance, he steps forth and raises a fist towards her, to seek a fist bump. Defiant eyes lock onto her own. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ...And I'd never lose to you, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: ....... Don't worry about that! Answer my question, is that sword girl a ninshija?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (Does this game function like most nrp)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) had found themselves engrossed, reading over the orphan&#39;s shoulder.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m done with that page. Turn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yells: Ah--- She got away!

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You should really try to be a little cooler, Try.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Positivity is good for the morale of others, so that's a good thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) cocks her head toward Kohaku as she hears her name being mentioned. "You wanted to talk?!'</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) spared a glance over toward Komo. Upon realizing that the older woman was insistent on tomorrow&#39;s start date, she clicks her tongue. Stepping further down the path, she turns her attention out toward the gathering.

<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) saw Might Try approaching that the Hatake kid from before. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> He extend a fist for a bump. <font color = white>&#34;Hatake, Raihara, right?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Her statement seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as the optimistic one rapidly approached with a fist held out, intent on connecting some type of gesture that was evidently foreign to her with the confusion crawling across her visage. So, what could she do except from taking an offensive stance?!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to fight me right now?&#34;</font>

Legs set further apart, bending ever so slightly at the knees as all digits furl upon both hands - only for the index and middle to extend in an untrained stance. Unique to her lineage.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) looks at Yuuto Uchiha. He examines the boy quickly, taking note of his features and disposition. He would too extend his fist and connect with Yuuto&#39;s own.

Far from impressed with her polished combat stance that had been handed down across generations, he seems shocked, apalled even. He leans back a tad, as if now -he- were the one who could catch something from her.

He turns to face Kyoko on that note, and takes a step away from the Hyuuga, turning his back towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll play.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: Wait-!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ahem. Handstand guy! Orphan girl! Uh-- regal girl with the wrinkled hands!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: That's me!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Get over here! We're playing a game with a cop for money!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: And, uh, anyone else who might wanna. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) huffed as he seemed to recoil from her, <font color = white>&#34;Must be fear...&#34;</font> That was a confidence boost to her secret training.--

<font color = white>&#34;-Oh?&#34;</font> She looks to the &#39;cop&#39; in question, <font color = white>&#34;Okay.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: I must sit out of this one, I did not gain my fancy clothing by gambling.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Are you two actually about to fight...?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I bet she's got fine money.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) looks at the group unblinking, his mind slightly excited at the mention of money.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Littering money.

Well, if the prize is something I can share, I won&#39;t give yah some.. So watch me win, okay?&#34;</font> The kid trudged through the crowd of Uchiha and Konoha&#39;s finest clones, making haste to Kyouko&#39;s request.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, milk-eyes, what&#39;s the game like?&#34;</font> He initiated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I doubt it's gambling. She's an officer of the law!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) feels a twinge in her heart, forced to recoil at the girl&#39;s statement. Somehow, she made it sound a lot worse than it actually was..
<font color = white>&#34;.. Something like that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) wraps their arm around the intense youngster.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Hmm?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I have my life savings.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: A--.. put that away.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: You wouldn't take that, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: No.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares at the hundred ryo like a revenous, starving dog would stare at a piece of juicy steak.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, this was a fine day- Though they weren&#39;t nobles he&#39;d hope for the two to fair well in the academy, it&#39;s not that he looked down on them. It was simply instilled at a young age he was to protect them, simply because the nobles were born with strong traits and nothing more. Mental conditioning was strong in this one, though he wasn&#39;t ruled by it.

<font color = white>&#34;I do, too... Just don&#39;t push yourselves too much, hard work is fine until you pull a muscle. It happens to everyone eventually.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: There's always something to lose. Dignity. Pride. Reputation. Though losing these aren't exclusive to gambling I suppose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) walks up to the platinum blonde girl

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'unno. Probably buy things I want. 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Could give it to me.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Or maybe learn how to do that one trick to make a bill disappear. 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Just a thought.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) nimbly steps backward, putting some space between herself and the blonde. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hoh-kay. Whoever wants to play, line up on either side of the wealthy blonde!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Kohaku's right.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That's too easy a way to make a bill disappear.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah she's gone.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: So what's the game?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) looms around the late bloomer with a bright smile. <font color = white>&#34;Your name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hm, hm..! You follow instructions well.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm unbeatable at anything except a language test.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Do your worst!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You're about to be proven wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh yeah? Spell charcuterie.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Shadduuuup, let her explain.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Uh.. s-h-a-r-k-u-t-a-i-r. 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: These type of games aren't my cup of tea.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) quietly slips into the line.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: What type?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Group games.

A pause, as she drags her foot along the dirt to make a makeshift line.
<font color = white>&#34;- this spot here, wins. Ah- and if you give an incorrect answer, whether you&#39;re first or not, you have to step backwards. The winner will receive.. ryo! Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Interesting...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: No questions, let's begin..!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5a5a8c>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) Being quite content with keeping to himself, the last thing he anticipated was someone waltzing up to strike a conversation. After all, given the circumstances, he figured most folks around were probably younger than him. It was a tough pill to swallow, being on the older side yet perched on such a low position of the shinobi ladder.

Still, he managed to conjure up a sheepish grin in return, refusing to let rudeness take over. <font color = white>&#34;Kaoru.&#34;</font> He replied, giving a brief introduction..</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) attempts to take a step forth, as he was the first one who answered a question. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No questions. Only answers.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) asks: What about my questions?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Your questions. My answers.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Step forward.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Heh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I see, I understand now.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) takes note of Kibo&#39;s deftness. To think, he took advantage of the situation so quickly..!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) is notorious for not listening to commands, so he rebelliously steps backward.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) All the students gathered infront of the Konohagakure memorial, the woman reached behind her to grip her hand against the &#39;weapon&#39;. A fancy stick with several tags around it.
  She pulled out an attachment, a small spade like object that she wiggled into place on the top of her staff. The tool now resembles a hoe.

<font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Konoha&#39;s academy course. Ya&#39;ll be training to be shinobi that defends the lands of Fire, we shinobi are the heartline of this nation - Just like farmers.&#34;</font>

 Komo tosses her hoe hard towards the dirt behind the students, piercing and parting the dirt with force.

<font color = white>&#34;Instead of feeding mouths, we shinobi solves and prevent those farmer&#39;s problems from interrupting them making harvest.&#34;</font>

A hand extended facing the handed tool, as it suddenly came back to her grasp. <font color = white>&#34;To do that, we practice and master the use of all life force Chakra. Before we git to all that...&#34;</font>

The woman places the hoe back to her rear, facing the memorial.

<font color = white>&#34;This memorial is what we call tribute, tribute to all the shinobi that has succeeded their limits for their nation, some giving up their lives for you to even breathe and be born. The Will of Fire. If you disrespect this, you&#39;re disrespecting your births. Ya&#39;ll remember that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Either way, he snuggles up in his clothing, overhearing Komo's words intently.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) cleared his throat and immediately put on a more calm expression when the teacher began to address the gathering of students.

His focus then shifted to the Tribute memorial... and he became a little more serious, even though the situation between Shishorama and the other Hyuuga was anything but that in his eyes.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only look at Nunya, as he would shake his head. <font color = white>&#34;Why would we know, when were not yet full shinobi?&#34;</font> he would then turn to the Inuzuka that was also the police chief, giving him a nod.

<font color = white>&#34;Well nice to officially meet you chief, names Himotachi, Sora, and this one is my brother Takuma.&#34;</font> they would point to the Ambitious one who had been a bit quiet till then.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stares blankly at the barking dog. He would tilt his head slightly inquisitively, as the man spoke to the dog, almost as if he understood it.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...You speak dog?&#34;</font>, he asked, his eyes settling on the animal once again.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what my boss would say to this...maybe I should wait for him?&#34;</font>

He would think while walking with his hands firmly placed at back of his head. Step by step he was slowly in front of the manor where he wonders what this group of people has gathered around for. In a friendly manner he smiles and joins them.

<font color = white>&#34;Erm...hello. I am Gosame and I am looking for someone to sign me up in the academy?&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Yoru, hai. Nice to meet you&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Prey?

<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) says: I thought he said his name was Yoru Prey...
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's how I took it
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: That'd be a weird last name.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looks confused at everyone repeating prey. Were they not understanding the word?

He nodded at the muscle head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Everyone else is prey! We just protect these prey.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Hey uh...I dont like being called prey.
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Geto, Takeshi - for anyone who didn't catch it

<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You're not all the way there are you>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: ?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would shrug his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Right sure....I suppose.&#34;</font> honestly alot of them were quite interesting, but quite a bit out there as well as he would move towards the building sitting down on the sidewalk, leaning against it, as he opened up a bag and took out a book to read.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hm....I mean if you think like that, it could help you fight like you were prey....adrenaline shortcut maybe
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I am not an illusion? Is prey confused?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) sighs and shakes his head, ignoring the further comments of Yoru. This certainly was an interesting group of people, but he had no time for games. He would head to the front of the academy and wait for an instructor to arrive.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where did everyone go?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) was confused a little bit by the arrival of Yoru. He did not know how to teach his kin about the conversation and proper etiquette of other Shinobi in the village that they protect.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh...well....prey is something we hunt down and play with or hunt down and eat....but I am sure that Yoru doesnt mean it on a bad side.&#34;</font>

Gosame has begun to explain, he was wondering just why is Yoru constantly calling people prey. Was he not taught how to talk properly in public? Regardless, he didnt want to be a smartass and call him out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) would cough a few times Yoru&#39;s smell was crazy bad <font color = white>&#34;Hey.. This has to be a crime.&#34;</font> he says his eyes watering a bit.

His hound Kane would Bark at the Smelly teen.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only chuckle. <font color = white>&#34;Why do you think that I am all the way over here chief?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) looks to Gosame with a nod

<font color = white>&#34;Ah I get it...that&#39;s okay, if he treats his enemies as prey, he&#39;ll get along with me just fine!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: If he does not, big boss will put him in place.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only nod to them before turning to the chief. <font color = white>&#34;So, chief whats one gotta do to join the police force anyways, figured I would ask and see what happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's a good question
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Bad side? Prey is prey. No good or bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) stretched her arms over her hea, <font color = white>&#34;Huh.. where did everyone go?&#34;</font> She&#39;d wonder.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Everyone is here, few people left but thats about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) asks: Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looked at the hound, tilting his head.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, prey? Hungry? I&#39;m not prey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) looks over to sora. <font color = white>&#34;To join the force.. The minimum requirement would to be a genin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;We have a long path ahead of us, especially to become Genin. That one is really important.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read his book as he listened to the chief, when his question was answered. <font color = white>&#34;Well that is good to know chief, I might have to join when I am able to then...I think that with my skills I might be a great addition, but of course that also remains to be seen.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: My name?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Yep.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) tilted her head to the side as she eyed the sharp-toothed kid.
     <font color = white>&#34;My name&#39;s Reimi..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) gives Sora a heads up <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods in understanding.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Hoshigaki Gosame. Its nice to meet you Reimi.&#34;</font>

He says with wide and happy smile, he came here to meet new people and sign up to attend the academy and become Genin to begin with.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I knew she lied.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Reimi makes more sense.
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Obviously did you really think Nunya was their name?
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Do I look stupid to you
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Never said you did
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Nunya sounds like a prey name.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: fits well.
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: You probably prey on boys
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: I do not have a preference on gender.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Damn...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: A question though. Did anyone sign up at all? Because if not....we can just camp the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue reading as he flipped to another page. <font color = white>&#34;I believe that is exactly what we are doing currently Gosame.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I signed up!
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: Same.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: I think I signed up?
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Oh? With who?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Thats awesome! I cant wait to sign up as well.
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) asks: Yeah, who with?
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: Shion Shiromu.
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: Yeah, let's go to the academy!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where is it?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: With the instructor, prey.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would point to the big building everyone is infront of.. <font color = white>&#34;This is the accademy, but it was empty when I was inside just a bit ago, still it is good to know a name of someone to look for.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) points to the building next to them with his index finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Apparently, according to the people that have been signed up already that is the academy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: I'm on my way then!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: Thanks!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Here I am again
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But there is....nobody inside I think.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: Where is the instructor?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) looks to the academy and back then blinks.

<font color = white>&#34;What in the...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Least no one was Gosame when I was in there last, and no one seemed to come in and out that I have seen, I can easily go look again
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Indeed it is still empty
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I need to start my training.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: We all have to train hard in and out of the academy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (im sorry but uh Allies within 3 tiles of a Sarutobi are bolstered by their leadership, gaining +5 to strength, speed and stamina. At Chuunin levels this boosts the range to 6 tiles and at Jounin it peaks at 10 tiles.  the fuck? this ss seems broken as hell)
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hai we will.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (Thats crazy.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (aye )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Uhm... what? That's crazy)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: So many preys around now.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (yeah, was looking at trees and bam stumbled on that gem)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kotsuki, Damuri(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (kaguya looks broken)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Geto, Takeshi(The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (Even in their last moments , the greatest leaders can find a way to inspire. When taking Critical damage, the Sarutobi gains +1 Grade to speed when moving to defend an attack for an ally with the intention of taking damage. Should the member of the Sarutobi clan die from this, their allies will gain a second wind of the Will of Fire , recieving B chakra and recovering Light to their current health.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (kaguya might seem good but sarutobi seems straight gorked)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Prey! Have you been training?!
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) says: I'm training as we speak. Interesting chakra you got there, too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looks completely confused at the response. How was that training... and how could he see his chakra? He couldn&#39;t even see his own chakra. Was this a weakness?

<font color = white>&#34;Liar! You aren&#39;t training!... Right?&#34;</font> Maybe the kid was lying... </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Is he still calling people, prey?
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: Yea, I think he was dropped on his head as a baby.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Ah! You were saying that to me?!
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: You know they say, when that happens people come out a bit crazy.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I wasn't dropped! Prey is prey!
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Why do you call people, prey?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yoshimitsu(The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) OOCs: ( I'm dead this whole time he didn't know I was talking about him I'm crying 
<br><font color=red>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) increases their stamina by Full - 12 / 12.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Lmao he thought you meant the other guy at the time!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Yoru kinda... dum dum)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Prey is prey?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (huh)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (tai adept said sreq acrobat)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Prey are those who are not at the top of the food chain!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Everyone is prey! Except us!
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: And you are...at the top of the food chain?
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Who is us?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) kept his eyes closed while Yoru spoke, <font color = white>&#34;I am definitely training. I can see everyone here right now -- without my eyes. And I&#39;m practicing how to expand that ability.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) laughs as he puts his hands on his hips and strikes a pose. His family was pretty well known!

<font color = white>&#34;Not me, but my family!&#34;</font> He turned a few times to give a good view of his... fairly normal looks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) just stares at Yoru, his eyes blinking a few times. He would adjust his mask to sit more comfortably on his nose.

<font color = white>&#34;I have no clue what you are talking about?&#34;</font>, he says, before turning his attention to Ishi.

He would hold a few fingers behind his back. 

<font color = white>&#34;How many fingers am I holding up?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (ironically very nara-esque)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) slowly removed his hands from his hips from shock. One eyebrow raised. Surely he was lying? Who didn&#39;t know of his family? Granted he didn&#39;t have too many obvious features!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re... joking... right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) ponders on it for a while before speaking up.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, he is someone who using his family to act like he is strong&#34;</font> He said with a snap of his finger as if he guessed it right.

<font color = white>&#34;I think that is why, he talks like that. Makes sense now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: I-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) took emotional damage as he paused in shock. The youth wasn&#39;t wrong. He himself wasn&#39;t strong yet... at least not by most people standards... He was just a fledgling, no not even a fledglng yet.

<font color = white>&#34;Y-you&#39;re... wrong! I&#39;m...&#34;</font> his voice got quieter near the end and started to trail off. How would he even respond to such a response? </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) sighed out. <font color = white>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter how much fingers you have up. As long as I know where you are at all times.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: So when do we start class?
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That went well.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (You found it>)
<br><font color=green>*Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) asks: Found the mines?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (ye kinda gotta glitch a part of the map. Warpers are iffy.)
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That I did. Met the client and now I have some ryo. I think I will go and purchase a knife with all this talk of crime.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled as he was spot on but no point in trashing someone for no real reason .
<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure you will get strong as time goes on.&#34;</font> He said leaving at that, with a bit of a smirk on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nodded spiritless. He wanted to be strong now! Not later...

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah... later on...&#34;</font> he sighed</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) supressed a yawn with the long sleeve of their kimono. <font color = white>&#34;Welll for now I will turn in. Hopefully we can meet these Sensei&#39;s soon.&#34;</font> They complained with a wave.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) increases their chakra by Full - 5 / 5.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) returned before heading to sleep. They knew better than most....proper protection came in numbers.

<font color = white>&#34;Here you are children. Play with these, someone must be responsible around here.&#34;</font> a laugh escaped from the bandaged mouth as they dumped several spinning stars with sharpened edges out</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Suichi (The uncouth youth-DontScissorWithTarps) says: Thank you friend
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) accepting the gift with a nod, pocketing it soon after.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: it is not much. But if crime really is bad in the big village then that should at least discourage a common bandit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) kicks a rock down the street, stopping at the comotion with a pique in interest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) cheered up somewhat with the gift. Shiny weapons were a step closer to getting strong!

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks, prey!&#34;</font> He shoved them into his pants irresponsibily.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That placement wont end well I am sure....as a matter of fact if anyone inquires I did not arm you.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I should lie?
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That can be useful. We are Shinobi, such a thing is a skill. In any case I am off to rest. good day
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I'm not a shinobi yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: Oh, man he going to be telling.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (gn though)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (night xD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) peers at the cloth man, his facial mask obscuring the parts of his face that would relay any emotions. He stares at the shuriken on the ground, before slowling bending over to pick it up.

He examines it brilliant shine, his finger tracing the edges of the blade. A small speck of blood would begin to protrude from his finger, as the sharp edge sliced his soft flesh.

He would place the shuriken into his cowl pocket.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Ahhh... if only i had enhanced smell)

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I won't tell! I can keep secrets, prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) 's steps were measured and deliberate as she approached the gathering of children. Her gaze remained fixed ahead, her eyes sweeping over the scene without a glimmer of interest. The chatter of the kids was a distant murmur, a background noise that held no sway over her thoughts.

Her features remained unchanged, her face an unmoving mask, as she walked closer to the group. Their voices rose and fell in a rhythm that didn't penetrate her consciousness. Shizuku's expressionless stare remained focused, her mind untouched by their words.

She was lost in a thick train of thought. Her mind set on her father's words and what they meant for her as a young Shinobi of a prominent clan. When the crowd was nearby, she stopped and fixated her stare on the people near her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Kotsuki, Damuri has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Stain(The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) OOCs: [everyones profile looks fucked

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The Kids grin stretches across his face showing his razor sharp teeth. He looked between the people who showed him attention waving his hand back and forth at both of them.
 
 <font color = white>&#34;Hi! Are you students too!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) gave a slight nod to the male.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I can't wait to learn!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) Sticks a pinky up his nose digging for gold.
 <font color = white>&#34;WOAH! Really!? That means we can be best friends then!&#34;</font> He replies to the black haired youth.
 <font color = white>&#34;I want to learn too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Protect the prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) stood like a statue in place, her hands resting at her sides.

<font color = white>&#34;...I am to be in class on the first day. I have yet to see our instructors.&#34;</font> The girl mutters. Her left hand&#39;s index finger twitches as she casts her eyes between the kids talking.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) Removed a book from her pouch and quietly started to read it.

<font color = white>&#34;I have yet to see them as well.. &#34;</font> She had said flipping through a page on her small book.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I only saw him once! He came and went!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The kid&#39;s pinky flicks a bugger from out his nose then after, he rubs his nose with the back of his hand.

 <font color = white>&#34;Hehehe, yeah! My papa said you have to kill the prey, always!&#34;</font> He shouted. Spinning around on his foot facing the crimson-haired-girl, he gazes at her book. <font color = white>&#34;Ohhhh! Is that a reading paper!? Whatcha readin best friend!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: No! Kill other prey, protect our prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) would shrug his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;Best friends? yea yea, sure whatever.&#34;</font>He said not really paying mind to it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times at the term best friend, the girl blinked a few more times before speaking. <font color = white>&#34;Fuuijinjutsu.&#34;</font> She said rubbing the side of her nose for a moment before going back to her study.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Hello everyone.
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Hey
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Hello prey!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0099cc>Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) Turns her head to look in the smelly boys direction.

<font color = white>&#34;Prey?&#34;</font> She questions.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Not me. I'm not prey?
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Never mind.
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: I wanted to see if anyone would like to go fishing with me.
<br><font color=green>*Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) says: Guess not.
<br><font color=green>*Autumn (The-crimson-haired-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm I could go fishing with you if you want.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0099cc>Lizzie (The lavender scented girl-Ivrozhul Payne) shrugs her shoulders as it seemed everyone was day dreaming. Working hard on their statue style stance it seemed. Kind of sucked but then she heard someone speak up.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh alright just follow me.&#34;</font> She said, looking over at the Crimson haired girl</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: Whaaaa!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: I like fishies too!

<br><font color=green>*Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) says: Hehe.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Yelling is what we do, prey!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: Yrd!

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: BAHAHAHAHAHAH!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) The lad came towards the group it seemed as though he&#39;s finally ran into some people within his village atleast people he actually notice.

After a back and forth yelling competition witht he gilly rock boy, hell look towards the guy giving a slight nod.

<font color = white>&#34;So What&#39;s your name?&#34;</font> He stated with his arms crossed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (back from work now)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would move over to the side, leaning up against the building as they would take out a book, looking at the others. <font color = white>&#34;So I take it we are all still waiting on the accademy? Though there are several new faces that I havent met yet it would seem.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Still waiting!
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: It happens I suppose
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The kid thinks for a moment. <font color = white>&#34;Uhhhhh... My name!?&#34;</font>
    The Gilly Rock boy had never given anyone his name!
    <font color = white>&#34;My Knick name is Gilly!~&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The child makes a sad face, but he does realize how informal it was.
 <font color = white>&#34;Awww.. okay, I&#39;ll call you sora mister.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would look at Gilly rock boy. <font color = white>&#34;Yeesh I am not that old man, I am only fourteen...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) looked at Gilly for a second for a second skin as blue as the water he shrugged for a moment as he looked at the kid and then to Sora he started to wonder how the 14 years wasn&#39;t an genin.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh Interesting so we&#39;ll all behind haha, i join late too.&#34;</font> he stated as he prepared the path of becoming a ninja rather than being a cook like his dad.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: Yaw...hello guys
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would nod to the others, as he opened a book once more. <font color = white>&#34;Aye, hello as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) asks: I guess everyone waits for these teachers?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) looked at the black hair kid, <font color = white>&#34;Hey!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) To be fair, Gilly didn&#39;t know how old he was. Being only 4&#39;7 and having such soft fish features, one could assume he was anywhere between five and ten. Eitherway, he shrugs his shoulders grinning.
 <font color = white>&#34;Four and teen? That&#39;s pretty old!&#34;</font> 

 He looks over at E nodding. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re four and teen too!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: It was black haired girl which talked weird stuff like mating
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Was it Reimi?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled

<font color = white>&#34;They must have been pretty ugly for you to think they were a man.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: Tell that to them
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) quickly covered his mouth as he seem to be gross out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: ..Man what were you guys talking about.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: I think that is something to be jailed for.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: Papa says when you drop a egg, you're mating!
