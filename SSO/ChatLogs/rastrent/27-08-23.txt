<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Sarutobi, Oda (The-Ras Trent) Damnation is the concept of divine punishment and torment in an afterlife for actions committed on earth. A damned human <font color = white>&#34;in damnation&#34;</font> is said to be either in Hell or living in a state wherein they are divorced from Heaven and/or in a state of disgrace from God&#39;s favor. In traditional Abrahamic demonology, the Devil rules hell, where he and his demons punish the damned.

These souls are the damned brought back through vile rituals and secret incantations that bind the body of the living soul to the rotten corpse upon the material realm. For some, this is a basic understanding of necromancy at its finest and for others, it is a gate that opens new opportunities to enslave others and increase the numbers of the already terrifying horde.

These corpses are no simple walk in the park for they carry a deadly secret. Some have been stitched together with string and care allowing for their fluids to ooze and drip out of their old wounds like heavy syrup. Others seemed to have strange markings riddled across their skin with ink that seem to glow a dark blue aura when subjected to spells that detect magic. Those who are marked with the arcane ink could explode or even become different and stronger depending upon the situation.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Sarutobi, Oda (The-Ras Trent) What some would say that is killing off these poor unfortunate souls is a Virus. However a virus is an infective agent that typically consists of a nucleic acid molecule in a protein coat, is too small to be seen by light microscopy, and is able to multiply only within the living cells of a host. Others claim that they have witnessed a bacterium of some kind. Regardless of what any of the experts can think the infection continues to spread at a rapid rate and it not only claims the lives of the victims but those who have tried to aid them in some way.

Scientists at the CDC have noted that the strange infection seems to even find its way past their safety guards making their precautions null and void. They have taken the liberty of calling the problem Viriotraspexius, more commonly referred to as the Red Plague, and its symptoms can take a toll in two directions. Both lead to the death of the infected and to those close by.

Symptoms Include:
1. Anger and Depression: The initial symptoms seem to last for 1-3 hours depending on the person. More impressive cases have noted that those who are more manic or psychotic in nature seem to mellow out and find themselves lacking the motivation for a majority of what life has to offer.
2. Disorientation: In continuation of the anger or depression the subject seems to lose track of where he or she is. These sets of symptoms go from 3-5 hours varying from person to person. Some if not many of the patients speak of seeing auras.
3. Violently Illness & Degeneration: Illness seems to strike at the victim causing vomiting and pain that wracks the body while simultaneously causing the skin to degenerate. Appears sometimes as extreme necrosis. The symptoms have been timed to last around 5-8 hours
4. Comatose & Shutdown: As it sounds the longest case lasted between 8-20 hours. This along with the fever kills off the victim.
5. Death
6. Optional(Infected Zombie): 15 seconds is the longest recorded time for this to occur but results may vary.</font></font></font>
