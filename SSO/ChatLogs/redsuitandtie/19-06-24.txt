He might have been bleeding from his head, but he didn&#39;t care - he two girls one for each arm, and was obviously talking up his game. Those feet moved with /swag/ as the kids called it. 

He was hip. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Yo, you two wann- oh FUCK SHE SENT PEOPLE,&#34;</font>

He seemed to toss the two women to the side; and thus they were laid out into the ground albeit uninjured one seemed to coo in joy. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Oh! So manly!,&#34;</font>

He grumbled, and replied.

The white irises of the half-shark inspecting the man. Not as if to inspect him for anything, simply to get a good look on who was causing such ruckus.

Whilst it could be admitted that he <b>was indeed cool looking..</b> and carried a aura of <b>swagger</b>. A job was a job, and hence, a order is an order. 

Though, the mentioning of the word &#39;pest&#39; flew over his head. Having already heard a many of slights due to his half-shark appearnce, it didnt phase him much.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) twitched; he had gotten heated yet once the boy spoke up? He smirked, and chuckled with a thunderous laughter.

   <font color = white>&#34;Finally! Someone with some fashion!,&#34;</font>

That smirk creaked, and if his face wasn&#39;t normal? It would slide right past the boundaries of reality, and bend it to his whims. It AURA was that potent; and slowly he eased a half-step back. 

A single foot in front of the other, and he curved his knee slightly. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Wait, you think I&#39;m weak?! I&#39;m Ito of the Takeshi Family! I run this shit, I&#39;m the boss, the don, and all that comes with it - you could even call me the Chairma-,&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I think we have to just get down to business yeah?&#34;</font>

He chose to ignore the weird looking man for now, he was already annoying him.

<font color = white>&#34;All we have to do is take care of him...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) It appeared the time for combat had come. The latch atop his poncho was undid swiftly. The poncho itself being cast aside as his own stylish blue threads were showcased in full. 

Hitting the pose akin of Hikari, the boy would enter a stance. A stance ready for any and everything that could be thrown at him.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mon then, from one fashion icon to another, I won&#39;t damage yer threads <i>too</i> much..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm...
<br><font color=teal>*Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) thinks: Tsk! Four of em...
<br><font color=teal>*Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) thinks: If it was only three I could use the Ito Style Ultimate Grand Flash.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) had already formed his stance; it was an oddity akin to more of a weird disco-posture as compared to actual combat but alas it was his style, don&#39;t judge, and be rude to the idiot. 

A grumble formed, and suddenly a a shimmering hilt of metal could be spotted coiled to his hip as he rolled his hand down admist a hilt so that he could draw what appeared to be a Katana!

Oh shit! It was actually more or less a generic-looking, and mass produced replica but alas to those Students? It looked like the greatest thing ever made, a shimmering tone of steel - gems, jewels, and a badass looking shark-skin felted tassel. 

This thing was cool. 

   <font color = white>&#34;WAHHHHHH-HA!,&#34;</font>

He quickly rushed forward - the battle had begun, a battle of immense and god-like strength would quickly unfol...wait a fucking minute?! A sudden THUD could be noted, and the man found himself quickly face-planted into the freshly paved bridge. 

Grumble...grumble. 

   <font color = white>&#34;..Gre-?,&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) would watch as the man would pull out what seemed to be a sword to him, he couldn&#39;t really tell the difference between a replica and an actual sword because he hadn&#39;t really trained with swords. He pulled back into a low stance awaiting the man&#39;s approach but would be surprised when he would trip and fall on hs face.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow... That&#39;s unorthodox...&#34;</font>

He wouldn&#39;t approach the prone man, waiting for him to either get back up or for it to be revealed that he had knocked himself unconscious.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice. His face showcasing nothing but utter confusion.

     <font color = white>&#34;<b>B.. Bro.. Get up, this is embarassing..</b>&#34;</font>

Then his eyes shifted over towards the katana and it&#39;s scabbard. Whilst it was not expressively said just yet - he definitely called dibs on such an item. A katana, a zanbatou, it did not matter. If any item could be attained..

<b><i>He had to attain it.</b></i>

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Nice katana.. A shame it&#39;ll be leaving yer hands t&#39;day.</b>&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;You would&#39;ve certainly made a name for yourself, if you had sworn to the village.&#34;</font>

When he noticed the man tripping he took an opportunity, throwing the shurikens towards the man as he stood, to where they&#39;d all land simultaneously.

He was starting to get himself into an adjustment; and as they all motioned to surround him and thus engage him once more? He was ready; a brief flash of movement, and he twisted about nearing a half-step leap upwards. 

Those blows creaked along below him. Those arms attempting to grasp him, and those Shuriken seemly curved along. They were about to crash into each other, and that simply aided him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Oh?! Its time to put my back into it!,&#34;</font>

A shift of his body; he was floating albeit briefly - the world coaxed into a near halt, and suddenly he dropped his arm forth and the length of steel seemed to coax along the air. 

A brief eruption of sparks fluttering into view, and suddenly an explosion of intense HEAT! OH MY WHAT WAS THIS?! He was starting to glow; an AURA began to flare up. He had begun to build up his HEAT BAR!

   <font color = white>&#34;OHHHHH YAH! ITO STYLE SUPER INTENSE FLAME CUT!,&#34;</font>

That heat erupted into a brief X along the ground, and then BOOM! He landed nearby.
