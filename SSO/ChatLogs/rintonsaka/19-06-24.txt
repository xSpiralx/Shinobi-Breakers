Given that his father was no longer present... He could, allegedly, speak his mind. He still pauses for a moment. Taking an almost paranoid look around before simply backing up and over towards Old Man Tooki.

Once there, he takes a second to wave to Chobina and call out,

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah! Nice to meet you Chobina! I&#39;m Utsuwa Hideo!&#34;</font>

Before leaning towards the old man and muttering quietly.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirls her lengthy black hair as she pondered the thought.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s very tempting ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she said, looking toward Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;But she&#39;s right. The last ante we had.. well you didn&#39;t quite honour that. You did show me some cash before but yer&#39; track record doesn&#39;t really uh.. inspire confidence. This is a -big- bet, ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she stated.</font></font></font>

Seemed like business as usual to him, though he was unaware of something might be going on. He waves to the group and stands idly by. Just in case there was a gathering for a reason</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) simply unveiled three-hundred ryo, counting each individual bill arduously in front of the young Uchiha.
Well--actually, on top of her head. <font color = white>&#34;I would expect you of anyone to understand the weight this... <i>demurral</i> entails.&#34;</font> One hundred Ryo.

The Zhu slowed down his count, moving further and further into a more visceral tone when he spoke, <font color = white>&#34;There is value within these mere paper marks. Indeed, such an amount--I believe your tongue for it would represent... Divinity? Roughly of course, though I would be astonished for you to recognize such a phrase.&#34;</font> One-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;Merely, in a triviality--it would represent a net gain for you, would it not?&#34;</font> Two-Hundred.
<font color = white>&#34;Just a simple game that you have succeeded in many a process.&#34;</font> Two-Twenty-Five. <font color = white>&#34;<i>What is to prevent you from....</i>&#34;</font> Two-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Complete and utter dominion?</b>&#34;</font>Two-Seventy-Five.

With twenty-five ryo in hand, the boy places it a the Uchiha girl&#39;s nose.
<font color = white>&#34;Defeat me. That provides one-thousand Ryo. And any form of assistance you would comprise.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) thinks: He's betting one thousand?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) was astonished and completely taken aback for a moment. Was this boy, no this insect really counting his money on her head?! Of all places. This was nothing but utter disrespect. Who could assume it was otherwise. She grasped at the money, balling it tightly in a fist before thrusting it back into his chest with a bit of force. The Uchiha returned it. Her anger was prevalent and she hadn&#39;t even bothered to hide it.

She&#39;d continue to press into his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.....&#34;</font> she tried her best to contain her anger which resulted from the blatant condescension he&#39;d just exhibited. <font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t just a gambler. Maybe I didn&#39;t represent myself well enough. I&#39;m bein&#39; nice right now. So be happy. Happy I ain&#39;t Kickin&#39;. Yer&#39;. Ass and takin&#39; yer money after using my head as a table for your money.&#34;</font> her finger jabbed into the boy&#39;s chest with a few of the words she&#39;d uttered. 

<font color = white>&#34;You might just be the dumbest smart person I&#39;ve ever met.&#34;</font> she scoffed. <font color = white>&#34;Now then. I&#39;ll gamble with ya&#39;. And when I beat ya&#39; and if you can&#39;t pay up. Well, I&#39;m gettin&#39; my money from you.. from Fubuki. From whoever there is. But don&#39;t forget who yer&#39; dealin&#39; with, alright?&#34;</font> 

She&#39;d calmed herself down by now and withdrew her hand from his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s have some fun. I wanna take my mind offa&#39; that ugly execution anyhow.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Don't bet, Reilin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) beckons the beige-haired youth over and gestures across the road.

<font color = white>&#34;The blueberry is a gambling addict. He&#39;s trying to sell himself, and money he doesn&#39;t have, to keep gambling and try to the girl in front of him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I also take no responsibility for his addiction. That game of two-hundred awoke something in him and it's not my fault.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I blame Reilin, honestly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) rubs the back of his head watching his kin blow up. He wasn’t entirely sure what was going on beyond the gambling. However. Using his cousins head for a table wasn’t cool.

He clenches fist and shakes a little, but Reilin had herself handled. Even within their own village it seemed there might be people to look about. That was kind of a worrisome sentiment.

But...surely the all of aspirant meant no disrespect? But he didn’t say so either. The boy, for his first time, was truly conflicted on whether to get angry or keep calm</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;I refuse, Raku. Unfortunately, this is no mere sport.&#34;</font> Not anymore, at least.

The boy unveils the set of cards, Human, Animal, Plant. He reveals the full amount to the Uchiha girl, prior to connecting the stack back together--handing it over to Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;As per usual, Tsuneko roles as the mediator--a non partisan. Should she rein the victory? The bout is nulled, Should she be victorious alongside one of us? The victor is the challenger.&#34;</font> Sure, a simple set of rulings, nothing&#39;s quite changed.

<font color = white>&#34;... <b><i>Xieji</b></i>. Eleven bouts.&#34;</font> A sudden deathmatch, winner takes all.

Who will reign supreme? Meixun&#39;s pride against Reilin&#39;s own? Meixun&#39;s devilish temperament against Reilin&#39;s fury-driven luck?

It is a challenge of.... Well it&#39;s probably not <i>that</i> important, they are just kids settling their petty differences.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Eleven? So high?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I suppose it's a large sum.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro)

<font color = white>&#34;I s&#39;pose it&#39;s fair to lower if we&#39;re even then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

All that stalling just for--

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Eleven bouts, if you were to win totally, you would require a minimum of six victories.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: You hold five, I hold three.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Good sir.. By my count, I'm already -at- six.

<font color = white>&#34;S-Sixth.... Bout...&#34;</font> The sixth bout? Didn&#39;t he choose animal? An--

<i>She won the sixth bout</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What did I disrupt?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled a shit-eating grin. Looking directly toward Meixun. She relished in her victory, soaking in his expression right now as the realization had dawned on him. He&#39;d lost. He&#39;d lost without even knowing it. Admittedly she too was a bit air-headed and hadn&#39;t even realized she won. But to lose whilst unaware was an entirely different thing.

She decided to draw a final card but did not flip it up this time around. She merely placed it down face down and ended her turn.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game.&#34;</font> as he hand pulled off of the card she turned it at the wrist, palm outstretched. <font color = white>&#34;You owe me a lot of money.&#34;</font> she said, still grinning and awaiting her deposit.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Good luck getting it, Reilin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) Five-Hundred Ryo. Down the drain.

For what, exactly? He didn't really <i>want</i> the money. Only the victory, but he couldn't even afford that much. His brain was circling indefinitely: the character for six, dancing about his head, collapsing on his thoughts with a paperweight keeping a stack from falling--though the stack is stacked too high, the paperweight only uses the stack as a diving boad and knocks it over. Translating every piece of paper with one singular character.

<b><i>6</b></i>

Two-Hundred Ryo, a crumpled mess--caused wholeheartedly by himself, returned back to its rightful wielder.

And....And now....

And now.... The remaining three-hundred.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled softly as a sum of money was placed in her palm. She uncrinkled the mess of it and instead of feeling happiness, she was confused. Her head fell to a tilt. <font color = white>&#34;I must be losing my vision.. Or I can&#39;t count properly.&#34;</font> she said. She lifted the money to hold it up to the sun but with all the sand, dirt and debris flying about it was hard to see fully. Nevertheless it was painfully obvious; this was not 500 ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Is this going to transform into 500 in a moment?&#34;</font> she asked, lowering the money now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: T-T-T-Tha....Is T-wo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I warned you he was betting with money he didn't have.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Two...Two-Hu.....
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Where's the rest, Blueberry?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I-I...t It is.....
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: This is even less than you counted on my head.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why are you holding out on me?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Told ya, good luck collecting your winnings.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: He'll pay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) wore the slightest condolence in his eyes, for the dark side of gambling throwing someone into the red so rapidly and mercilessly. He gave slow shakes of head to the scene. 

<font color = white>&#34;Gambling is truly a dangerous vice.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It really is- Oh, I didn't even see you Katora. Hey.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Good evening, Hideo. I'm surprised you didn't join them.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Got tired of losing ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Just wasn't in the mood
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair, fair.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) How could he have been defeated!?

Actually

<b>BANG</b>

The boy knocked himself in the head, sticking out his tongue, Gon style.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry. Forgot one thing. I&#39;ve never won a single time I&#39;ve partook in such a challenge.&#34;</font>

He unveiled the final remains of the Ryo, smacking Reilin on the head playfully.
<font color = white>&#34;I would&#39;ve suspected a bloodhound such as yoruself to be able to recognize the stench of a proper sum... Ah well, suppose not.&#34;</font>
He still has the audacity to goad? Well, of course he does.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Financial Murder. In broad daylight. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I believe the term is.... Extortion..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Its a crime he commit against himself, really.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s glee quickly returned to her. She added the remaining 300 to her stack of cash and thumbed through it to validate that it was all there. Once it was, the Uchiha tucked it away neatly in her kimono for safe keeping.

Though her smile had not faded just yet, she looked at him expectantly and without saying anything. Wide-eyed and staring. She heard his most recent words and this was her reaction. An unwavering stare, eyebrows risen in arches.

Finally breaking her silence. <font color = white>&#34;As I clarified before we began -and- you agreed. I get the 500 -and- you become my subordinate.. Did ya&#39; foerget?&#34;</font> she asked. <font color = white>&#34;I believe -your- response was... &#39;Should you retain the victory.&#39;..&#34;</font> her fingertips found themselves instinctively creating a finger-pryamid. Villainy.

<font color = white>&#34;Did ya&#39; forget? Huh? Did ya&#39;, did ya&#39;?&#34;</font> her brows rose even more, if that were possible. <font color = white>&#34;I guess -I- forgot about the initial 30 you still owed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. It's why I stay away from high-stakes gambles.

He makes a mad dash for it, a maddeningly mad dash for it. So mad of a dash that the dust storm seemed to hold a horizontal vortex where Meixun once stood.

<font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Tomorrow! I promise you&#39;ll be allowed to... Aah! We shall discuss it further tomorrow!!!</b></i>&#34;</font> He screamed into the storm while fleeing.

And a fast one too. Much too fast for her to keep up with even if she wanted. Though she didn&#39;t mind, he&#39;d have to come around sooner or later. 

<font color = white>&#34;Right. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be seein&#39; ya&#39;, Henchmen #1.&#34;</font> she called out as he disappeared out into the storm.

He removed silky fabrics before walking out to the male area with a towel and shorts on. The reticent young boy slipped into the water, placing a palm onto the sand used for decoration. He would start practicing imbuing it with his Chakra.

After accomplishing that, he would shift it around without weaving a single seal.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If you wanna be a coward and beat me up go ahead.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I mean I'm not letting you do it for free but yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Don't be complainin' ta' me. That's what ya' pay for our protection fer'.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I have to pay you, so that you, will stop being lame?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's lame.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: You're gettin' it~
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You should pay me to make me pay you.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: HUH?

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Pay me to pay you to stop being lame so you don't have to pay me to pay you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Cause you won't be lame in the first place so you wouldn't need to pay me to pay you to stop being lame.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) blinked a few times, trying to do the math in her head to see if that made any sense.

Imaginary numbers and numeric symbols floating about.

<font color = white>&#34;I pay her to pay me....&#34;</font> she reiterated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Egh... This is makin' me feel queasy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You're bad at keeping track of numbers. Just trust Fubuki and I on this.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: S-so..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: When do I get paid then?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Gotta spend money to make money Reilin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll pay you after you pay me.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ohh
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Give her fifty so she can give you fifty to leave her alone. So you'll have gained fifty.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Exactly.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: And if I do that for both that's 100!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Now you're getting it!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hehehe, this'll be easy.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'll be drownin' in cash.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wait-
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: We've changed her from an extortionist to a loan shark...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: About the same thing.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I dunno what an exhibitionist is
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's an art thing.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: But loan shark sounds badass
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) pointed at Hanaka.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He's an exhibitionist.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: Ew.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Weren't you the one who was fine with people peeping on others?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Reilin...  But they're paying you YOUR money that you paid them.  So collectively you're getitng 0.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: I was tha' one who said sometihn' about it!
<br><font color=teal>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) whispers: Shut up. That's the trick.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: You were the one who said it was fien
<br><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) whispers: Eh heh heh.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: No no, the other girl.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I never said it was fine. I bonked someone's eye for peeping.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s brows furrowed contemplatively as she heard Tsuneko. The Uchiha fell silent as her eyes darted from left at a moderate pace. Clearly dwelling on the thought for a moment.

She even counted on her fingers some. <font color = white>&#34;Heeeeeyy....&#34;</font> she came to her conclusion.

<font color = white>&#34;She&#39;s right! If I got 50... And give -you- 50 then I&#39;m at zero.. An&#39; you give it -back- I&#39;m just right back where I started!&#34;</font> she pointed toward Fubiki and Hideo in a accusory manner. <font color = white>&#34;You two are -bad- at math!&#34;</font> she did not think they were pulling one over her, but merely that their math was off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: I never said that I was fine with it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at Tsuneko a bit frustated before sighing, her gaze directed towards the loan shark.

<font color = white>&#34;That was the point, to fool you! But then SHE--&#34;</font> Fubuki pointed at Tsuneko who was literally right next to her, <font color = white>&#34;--ruined it all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You better not be fine with it or I'll poke your eye, with a stick.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: !
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: Y-you mean you -tried- to fool me?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a single, muffled laugh.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Earning ryo's all about meeting the people's demand. Find out what they want and make them pay for it. 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) asks: Why would you poke my eye now?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: 'Course I did. In fact I didn't try, I did do it.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'd poke it so you wouldn't peep.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Katora I may have to increase my prices
