<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) Nodding to each as they introduced themselves he pulled out three scrolls and handed them to each student. He then took a fourth one out and revealed the information inside it.

<font color = white>&#34;These are signup scrolls. Please fill these out and have your parents sign them then bring them back. If you do not have parents then sign the second line that states so.&#34;</font>

He points to each section

<font color = white>&#34;The first section is simple. Just your name, age, eye color basic descriptors. The second section goes over what you will be doing while at the academy. The third section is a waiver that states any harm recieved during training courses is not to be used against the academy. The fourth section states that this course is made to raise shinobi of the village and what that entails.&#34;</font>

He smiles once again and rolls the scroll up.

<font color = white>&#34;Feel free to fill these out in your spare time but know that school starts soon so don&#39;t take too long.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nods his head as he grabs scroll from the instructor. He could read just enough but it&#39;s not like he truly understood what many of it meant, but he was told enough.

<font color = white>&#34;Great! Signing up!&#34;</font> He bit his forefinger before writing his information down on the scroll. Just the basics as asked.

Name: Yoru
Age: 12

He held his hand out for Shion to grab it back.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) takes the scrolls and nods.

<br><font color=green>*Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) says: I can start teaching as soon as I have students but I believe the year starts sometime later today. I would say try to get the l scroll signed in the next 6 hours.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) went ahead and begin to fill out the paperwork, it was quite simple as the man had stated. 

-Yoshimitsu, 15.- 

Took him a bit to think over the doing part, was it asking him what he wanted to train in? He would stop and ask.

<font color = white>&#34;Umm, for this doing part is like what we aiming to learn?&#34;</font> He asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shiroimu, Shion(The warm man-Limb) OOCs: (also I am a chunin)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) would give a nod before going back to fill it in.

-Taijutsu/Kenjutsu-

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) takes the scroll from yoru and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;If you needed a pen I could have offered one. Should have kinda handed those out was not expecting a scroll this quickly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) tosses the scroll back to the chuunin. If he had paid attention, he would have noticed Tajin did not bring out any writing utensils thus leaving the scroll blank.

<font color = white>&#34;Yokai, Tajin. Twelve years old and I plan doing whatever is needed most of in the village.
