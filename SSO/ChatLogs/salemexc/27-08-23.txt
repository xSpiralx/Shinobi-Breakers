<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) heard the small mumble from the dark haired boy, and saw him shaking his head. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you only have to gain from listening to this kid. Trust me, it&#39;s not that bad.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;We just saw the Hokage Manor and the Fire Monument with some explanations from the teacher. Then we had to climb a mountain, the exercise had us helping each other.&#34;</font> They had formed a system pretty easily. <font color = white>&#34;We just made a system to help get everyone to the top, helping pull and throw people upwards.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t terrible.

<font color = white>&#34;Somethings will be easier by just relying on your classmates like that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) nodded his head a few times, pretending to listen to Yuuto as he kept his hands on his ears, blocking out all the noise, when he seemed like he was done talking he lowered his hands.

<font color = white>&#34;Wowwww...Sounds cool.&#34;</font> he stated, raising a hand to block his yawn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would scratch their head while looking at their sister wonder why she was in the streets fighting people.,but either way she was proud of her super buff sister.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah!I&#39;ll have to treat you out for some pork buns later then.....wait.&#34;</font>the gambler would wrap their arm around the Uchiha<font color = white>&#34;Heeey Yuuto wanna treat my sister and myself to some pork buns?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Paled orbs bounce from the group to the one who had just abruptly collided with the ground, clearly lacking the skill to land like a shinobi would. Her arms crossed, canting her visage ever so slightly to one side, <font color = white>&#34;Top of the academy, but landing like that... Hmh.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Was the fight with that red-haired boy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yeah, Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Dog..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Treat us to some pork buns!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was listening to everyone and was about to answer Kumirama until he noticed a familiar sigh. His hand was instantly raised and pointed at the dog. <b><font color = white>&#34;You!&#34;</font></b>

The lost dog, this time he was going to catch it! He charged at it! That 50 ryo bounty was his!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) ignores the loudness. <font color = white>&#34;Good morning. Most in the arena have fallen to the lull of sleep.&#34;</font>

She idly watched the dog, surely this could be entertaining if nothing else.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) did no move a muscle, it merely tilted its head to the side in confusion as the overconfident kid charged at it. With a dumb look on its face as he pants joyfully.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Is that your dog?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) gasped at the appearance of the dog. He casually waved in his direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Cute..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Hmm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) got in front of the dog and instantly tried to swipe the dog from the ground as gently as he could, because he obviously didn&#39;t want to hurt it. He just needed to catch it and return it to an old lady as far as he remembers.

<font color = white>&#34;No, not my dog, he&#39;s wanted though! He&#39;s Miss Kome&#39;s missing dog, apparently he goes missing every week. It was on the newspaper. Me and some others tried to catch him last night but we failed.&#34;</font> He didn&#39;t expect him to be caught this easily.

Yuuto had been sure this dog was the most elusive creature ever until now.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, noticing everyone&#39;s focus was on something else, a small smirk formed under his mask. First he took a few steps back then if no one noticed his getaway it turned into a full blown sprint somewhere he could take a nap.

<font color = white>&#34;Wow...what a cool looking dog...&#34;</font> he mumbled...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) gets her pokeball ready.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Oh, get him!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Powerful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) froze in place, he felt a scary presence behind him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) rushes toward the dog in a manic fashion, clearly intent on having fun moreso than actually capturing it. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (yo dogmin, love your icon
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Looks like you found the dog, huh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) shrugged as she would similarly make her way over, arms crossed behind her back as she drew nearer and nearer. Caution was stuck to her features, as she didn&#39;t quite want to touch a random dog. That would get her hands and attire dirty - or worse... catching something from it.

<font color = white>&#34;It looks like it bites.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) was picked up without no issue. It seemed pretty dumb, just looking at all the new faces he has never seen before with clueless stares. Even with the intense youngster rushing at it, the dog seemed to have no common sense or any feel for potential danger... Or what it that confident in it's own abilities...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) yells: Urrrf!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: That thing is gonna bite you, Yuuto.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) <font color = white>&#34;Let me see the dog!&#34;</font> Shisorama demands as she attempts to rip the poor thing from Yuuto&#39;s grasp. <font color = white>&#34;I want to hold him!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) found this to be incredibly easy... either way, one thing was certain. <font color = white>&#34;So fluffy!&#34;</font> He wanted to squeeze this dog in a hug, but didn&#39;t want to hurt him. <font color = white>&#34;Let him bite me then, look at him! It would be worth it.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Nope, you can&#39;t hold him.&#34;</font> He told Shishorama. <font color = white>&#34;I caught him, try next week.&#34;</font> She should know by now she was not stronger than him, even if she tried to get the dog from his grasp, his arms simply wouldn&#39;t budge.

<font color = white>&#34;Now... Kohaku, any clue where we take this thing. I can get the bounty and treat all of us for some pork buns.&#34;</font> He nodded at Kumirama, he would get her those pork buns she seemed to want.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) was like a motionless doll as the two bickered for him. Clearly, he wasn't fighting it at all.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) rested her hands behind her head, watching this scene, unfortunately it was no where near as entertaining as she had hoped.. such is life it seems.

<font color = white>&#34;What a calm dog..&#34;</font> She observed the fluffy mass, perhaps it was only waiting for the right time?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) continues to wave at the dog, he was just happy to be there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) rubbed the side of his cheek as he watched Shishorama be herself, acting before thinking in the situation. At least this one did&#39;t seem to endanger anyone, just a puppy with a lack of survival instincts. As for  where to take the dog really?

He&#39;d shrug, <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know- The lady&#39;s house probably, at least that&#39;s what common sense dictate but i don&#39;t know where she even lives.&#34;</font> The younger Uchiha admitted, he was actually looking around through the town to get a read of the other areas outside the Uchiha Compound.

He&#39;s at least foud everything of importance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) fell asleep, snoring every once in a while.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) already felt regret at the thought of returning this dog... but he can't keep it... he can't.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So cute..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) would take a few steps nearer, squinting at the dog as she inspects it for visible signs of rabies or something. She heard every animal you see running around has that, and it&#39;s not pleasant.

<font color = white>&#34;Then it looks like you have a new pet for now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tried and tried to get Yuuto budge. He was stronger, sure, but he wasn&#39;t so much stronger that she couldn&#39;t budge him at all. She only two letter grades away!  <font color = white>&#34;Come on! Let me hold him!&#34;</font> She complains loudly.

If something didn&#39;t give, physical violence might be the only option.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) skips her way down the bridge&#39;s guard rail, using it as a gymnast would a balance-beam. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hmm, hum, ha-hum, hm, hm-- hm??&#34;</font> 

She noticed a collective of dog admirers beyond the end. And-- <font color = white>&#34;Hey! You guys found the always-runs-away pooch! Cool beans.&#34;</font> A hop sends her back to solid ground. She posts up in the general vicinity, deciding it best to keep her distance. Animals hated being crowded. Right? Right. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: You're gonna break the dog...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm not!
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) asks: Can..I pet him...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It didn't even try to run away.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just let him take a swim. He'll be fine after.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: You should bathe it.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I don't think it would stop you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) That was true, but damn was she stubborn! <font color = white>&#34;You know I would&#39;ve actually let you hold the dog if you simply asked nicely, right?&#34;</font> He just squinted at the girl as his arms actually began to budge.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s sleeping right now, when he wakes up, I&#39;ll let you, now stop yelling, Shishorama.&#34;</font> Now he had to treat her like she was a younger kid. <font color = white>&#34;You can hold him before we find the old lady or when he wakes up, until then,, calm down.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And yeah, Hanako, wanna help us go look for the owner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) shuffles his feet toward the sleeping dog, intent on petting it's fluffy head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) immediately relents and allows her arms to flop lifelessely at her side. <font color = white>&#34;Can I please hold him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So soft..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Is Senju, Kumirama among you guys?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's my sister!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Kumirama, Komo-sense is calling for you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was alive to witness this historical moment. Shishorama actually relented. She gave up on something, he had convinced her to step down. <font color = white>&#34;See? Was that so hard?&#34;</font> With that said, he gently slid the dog onto her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Sensei. We found the dog, where do we take him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I didn't even know you had a sister...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Sure. I'm the forty-first best person in the village at finding dog owners. I'll lend you my skills.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Oh. Give it here, I'll give him back to Miss Korme.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I haven't seen my sister at all.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Alright, Shishorama, hand the dog over to Sensei, then we can go for some pork buns.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hm. My skills say Sensei will handle the rest. Mission accomplished.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Good job, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I did my best! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah, here's the other half of the academy.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Yes, Batsu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) was a polite young woman at her core. She had no need to be violent against her friends unless absolutely necessary. To ask and use manners was not beneath her. 

<font color = white>&#34;Nice!&#34;</font> She says as she takes hold of the big fluffy boy. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s so fluffy!&#34;</font> She shrieks in excitement before handing the pup to the Sensei. <font color = white>&#34;Here you go, Sensei. Yuuto was able to grab him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Farewell...doggy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i love this dog icon
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (looks a lot like my dog irl)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Were you at the lesson?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) asks: We had a lesson already?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I had a supervised spar today Sensei! I did you proud!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: You mean the rock climbing?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) had no idea if Komo would actually be proud or not. She just assumed that would be the case.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It wwas mainly a team work exercise.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Well, how did you do?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I was carried up, sadly my strength didn't do much for climbing. I helped pull people up once there with a group.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) picked up the pup with her lazed eyes gazed upon the creature. It seem like she was all to used to this puppy, clearly did not have the same effects of its presence effecting her at all.

The puppy seemed familar with the Chuunin, easily hopping into her hands and climbing on top of her head as if it was one of its hangout places.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, Ko... Time for you to go back home.&#34;</font> She said, digging into her pocket and handing the &#39;bounty&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see. Unfortunate but shows true teamwork.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would clear their throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Soooo Yuuta what about those pork buns.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tossed the money to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, <font color = white>&#34;I hope we deal more with Chakra next lesson, while my Physical Strength isn&#39;t anything too special I can make that up with my chakra control.&#34;</font>

He was more than sure of that.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: We shall see.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: There goes that word again. Chakra...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) nodded at the dog, bidding it goodbye with a final pet. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we should go for those pork buns now-&#34;</font> Then he caught the money tossed his way. <font color = white>&#34;My treat! Let&#39;s go?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Kibo, you don't know what chakra is?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...Makes sense for him.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Heeey there, Maya. Who's your friend?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yup! Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh? No idea.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I think it's more becase we are from a clan, yes... It's an energy Shinobi use for Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, and even enhancing Taijutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: An unknown friend. I see, I see.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) approaches with pocketed hands...!

He briefly hesitates, but eventually nods a couple of times.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know what it is, no. Am I supposed to?&#34;</font> He questions, while taking steps forth.

He raises a hand to high five Hanako as he walks past.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, friend..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Where is the weapon shop?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It can be morhed into a physical shape if you train hard enough, too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Friend. Make yourself known! Oh-- hi, other friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I've been demoted from friend to other friend, it seems.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) plops his bottom onto the wooden bench, kicking his feet along.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hajime of the twenty ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: So it's energy, right? What's it look like?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Ah.. we my introductions missed previously..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) moves along with puppy in head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How goes your day?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It's going well! I just learned another piece of key knowledge that I need to beat the clans at their own game. This Chakra stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ha ha! Of course not. I miss nothing. Ever.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It's kind of bright, and blue-ish.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) missed a lot. All the time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) held a hand to her forehead for a moment, with a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Okiku. I was walking around the academy stuff with you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ohh..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I remember that!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Certainly..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) barely remembers what she had for breakfast this morning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah yes, this is Okiku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wwould make a flame between his hands to demonstrate, <font color = white>&#34;My Chakra takes on the properties of fire like all of the Uchiha- It&#39;s used to use Katon based Ninjutsu.&#34;</font> He stated before putting the flame out, the demonstration was simple but more effective than his explainations of it as a whole.

<font color = white>&#34;It basically runs through all of us, taking different forms based on the individual or in some cases the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hello, Okiku.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Fire...?!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Ah, right. Uchiha are known for fire.
