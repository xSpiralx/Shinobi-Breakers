The very ground everyone is standing on begins to cave and quake, leaving nothing but rough terrain not easily crossed to scamper away from. The attacker would rock the puppet’s pieces, only to find the deformed body of a young child inside - his fists now digging into a thin young sternum and lifeless corpse.

The body itself, blowing up once it had been breached. Leaving the attacking Hyuuga with moderate injuries from the resulting explosion.

Papers reign down from above after smoke clears - with a singular message <b><i>we are already here.</b></i> Each of the students just barely scraping by with nothing more than minor injuries as they’re protected from the resulting explosions by their commanders. 
After all that’s left - nothing but splinters and chunks of a young boy’s body remain. The hyuuga’s palms soaked in the child’s blood. A child of Amegakure - a Genin, no less.

The expert use of the water jutsu saved the students from most of the despair, with nothing but be try minor injuries as a result

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;l help patch up anyone I can..&#34;</font> She spoke out, removing her medic pouch and bringing out a few simple supplies.

Soon as he begins to reer back for a second attack, the remains seem to glow bright and hot. A moment later, the explosion comes.

The muscular man tries to shield his face but is blasted backwards. He has enough sense to force a roll and lands on one knee, bleeding from various cuts- and his own hands covered in someone else&#39;s blood.

He stands, realizing the attack was over. He spits the saliva and blood from his mouth, not seeming to care that he just battered a child&#39;s corpse.

Mikazuki still had her mouth still slightly gaped, all the while she positively nodded as if agreeing to them, in whatever. They blinked a few times, keeping static, analyptical eyes upon them and their features for a few seconds, ceasing to blink, for a long time, just a piercing, replying stare.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) seemingly starts to melt,  the fingers on their temples made her eyes tremble lightly, strangely enough, they began to lose the strength on their feet, no longer standing still perfectly.

She closed her eyes abruptly and lowered her head a bit, she brought her right hand up to her head, it&#39;s like she&#39;s had a small headache- For some reason, though it doesn&#39;t seem to affect them as much...

She then shoves the small wooden jar towards Mikazuki. <font color = white>&#34;Here, in case your head hurts again..

A quick pat of her kimono and she begins to walk away, in the direction of the Hyuuga compound.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;...&#34;</font>

He felt deep down that he was still incapable of learning how to walk on water.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) resurfaced and spat the water out of their lungs as they gasped for air and caught Botan's basic explanation.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Then ye&#39;ll sink! Kahahah!&#34;</font>

With that resounding laugh, he threw up the Tiger seal as instructed. Unfortunately, instinct took over. Rather than attempting to step down onto the water&#39;s surface, his shark-like genetics drove him to instead toss himself into the water head-first, his body moving before his brain could stop the motions, and with a splash, he found himself in the water with Bill, remaining submerged as the orange-haired youth dragged himself up to the surface.</font></font></font>

Lurking under the murky surface like a predator, he found himself stalking the undercurrents for the fish that the Chuunin had requested.

He was no stranger to the canals of Amegakure, and he was no stranger to the sea life that called the waters around the village home. Plus, he had the natural advantage compared to his peers. While the surface was their domain, the waters belonged to the Hoshigaki, and in time, they surrendered to his will.

He finally re-emerged, holding a writhing, squirming eel in his left hand, and in the right, a fair-sized Yellowtail, of which he dropped down in front of the Chuunin.

   <font color = white>&#34;Here is fine,&#34;</font>

A shift, and suddenly she sent her fist directly into a nearby tree - one that was obviously nearly at the end of its span. A brief creak, and then suddenly it exploded with raw vigor. 

A shower of splintered, and now usable fire-wood was littered around it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Now the fun part,&#34;</font>

Her hand eased back behind her back, and met with the opposite.

A brief SNAP could be noted. It was plopped down admist the others.

Also- Yes, Hoshigaki, I know, it&#39;s hard to see me with the water behind me and stuff, but I assure you, I&#39;m ACTUALLY here.&#34;</font>, he spoke addressing the stern boy, the Chuunin and the girl with the enchanted aura in turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Perfect, once the fires are started - would you kindly show them how to prep the fish they have?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It doesn't need to be fancy, a basic grill will do nicely.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded; she moved to draw something from her hip and in turn it was a rather fancy-gilded and ornate dagger. It wasn&#39;t much but it held pupose, and she tossed it over towards the Hoshigaki. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Use that,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (oops

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (set up a village wide battle, with a score system.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..but i already know that
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) caught the knife - Barely, almost fumbling it and dropping it to the ground before achieving a firm grip. Deciding to work on the biggest fish first, he approached Afro&#39;s large Catfish, before tilting the knife, lining it up with the fish&#39;s eye, and spiking the knife into the fish&#39;s brain, killing it instantly.
<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s better to make sure the fish is dead before you prepare it or it&#39;ll thrash, for big fish it&#39;s easier to either spike it through the eye or to slam it against a rock REALLY REALLY hard.&#34;</font>

From there, he began to prepare the fish, spilling the catfish&#39;s guts as the Jounin approached. He pointed a free hand to Afro, the red-headed individual, while his free hand began to disembowl the fish, tossing the scraps into the water behind him.
<font color = white>&#34;Gotta get the insides out, they&#39;re not good eating. If it&#39;s a lady fish, you might find some roe inside, which is REAL good eats though, so you gotta pay attention. This one doesn&#39;t have any.&#34;</font>

From there, he descaled the fish by scraping the fish&#39;s skin with the blade of the knife, peeling off the hard, inedible scales and leaving the skin below, and once more he tossed the scraps into the water.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, so, we can eat the head too, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of it, so someone else can have that part. Now we gotta light the fire, and make a little contraption to actually cook the fish. We can just prop it up over the fire, or make a little spit for it with some sticks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) strolls slowly through the village, their elegant kimono swaying in the Amekagure breeze. They would slow their approach as they noticed the large gathering of people.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what&#39;s going on over there?&#34;</font>, they thought, looking around for a vantage point where they could see what everyone was circling. They would walk over to a tree near the commotion, their small frame dwarfed by the massive conniferous tree.

With a grunt, they would jump not very far into the air, grasping the tree and slowly beginning their climb up. It would take a few minutes before they found a branch that could hold their weight.

With a small childish squeal, they would grab the sturdy branch and sit upon it dangling their legs as they observed the crowd below.

<font color = white>&#34;WOW! That&#39;s a big fish.&#34;</font>, he said with a child like giggle.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) looked from left to right, and seeing that nobody was willing to help he let out a sigh.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, okay. I&#39;ll do it. Just... Bundle the sticks up like this, put the smaller ones on the bottom because they&#39;ll burn easier, anddd... To grill the fish, we&#39;ll grab these two sticks that kinda look like forks, and just...&#34;</font>

He jammed the two sticks into the ground, grabbing a third stick and impaling the fish from mouth through the back as if it were a spit, before propping it up over the campfire with the two Y-shaped sticks jutting from the ground.

<font color = white>&#34;Now we just need to light the fire, and then we can eat the fish. Usually someone just lights the fire for me, so uh... Help.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is several ways to light up the fire without ninjursu
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Get two dried stricks and then make one of them rub the middle of the other stick

   <font color = white>&#34;Or,&#34;</font>

She motioned to draw a rather old looking, blunt, and well-used Kunai from the confines of her sleeve. It wasn&#39;t much to look at, but it had a purpose and she was about to show it. 

A moment more and she kicked up a flat rock from the ground before she caught it, and then motioned towards the gathered bundle of sticks before she rolled the rock forward, and then followed with the Kunai. 

A brief strike, and she smeared it across the stone-face before a few sparks flickered forth. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Like so,&#34;</font>

She tossed it over towards the Hoshigaki.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,guess kunais have enough carbon to make sparks.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Most steel can do it, yes.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah...but  if was not that hard it won't worked.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A good bit of Kunai are made with less pure materials, thus it has a higher carbon amount.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) caught the rock, and allowed the Kunai to hit the ground by his foot rather than attempting to catch it to save his fingers, and as instructed he began to strike the rock against the Kunai&#39;s metallic surface. Of course, this began to create sparks, and as he moved the duo of tools closer to the dry scraps at the bottom of the campfire, it began to smolder, burn, and eventually, roar into an open flame, the smell of cooking fish wafting through the air after a few moments as the flame licked against the animal&#39;s flesh.

<font color = white>&#34;Boom! And that&#39;s how you cook a fish! Well- How you START to cook a fish. It&#39;s not cooked yet. This thing&#39;s probably so fresh you could eat it raw without being sick, but it&#39;s better to be safe, I think.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Also since is campfire it will take longer than a oven.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: So expect atleast....maybe a hour at worst depending on the heat

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Uh, yeah? I did? Because it's clearly pretty IMPORTANT to learn stuff like this for the people who might not know? Just because you know how to do it doesn't mean that it's useless.
