<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (it's vague
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (either Speed to avoid jutsu, or build to clash jutsu, or interrupt handseals)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (ah yeah
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (my advise is if you go for shurrikenjutsu to interrupt have speed enough to evade
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (shunshin that is, 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shanin(The black haired teen-Toopher2) OOCs: (My advise is everyone builds for making big booms and being able to rp flexing your chakra on people.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (but if you have plenty of chakra, just build to clash)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (probably might get bodied my first 70 fights
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (tbh, here's my advice
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (no matter your build
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (buy 2 ranks in shurikenjutsu
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (My advise is to always have just enough shurriken jutsu, 2 ranks yeah
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (it's only 7 points, it gives you +3 inventory slots, and you can throw two tools per round instead of one
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (it's value
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (Even if you're not a shurriken build, you always want to spend resources to win, and shurriken throwing is a damage resource)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (though i swear it used to be cheaper
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (forcing people to evade or take damage is sometimes enough to tip a fight)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (though tbh you could spend 9 points and get +6 instead of +3
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (but that's on you
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (Also NEVER be well rounded)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (well rounded builds are senju exclusive)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (that is the senju shtick after all)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (the combat system is going to take a while to learn
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (do you guys think 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (It's honestly easy, I usually make jounin
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (oops
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (taijutsu is always good

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (do you guys think I rp obnoxiously?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (focus ur build so you can get it faster
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (naw you're fine
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (also hashirama path is a genjutsu
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (My most Solid of solid advise, is to pick a main Damage stat, the stats being Strength, agility, control, Endurance speed and Stamina are defensive stats)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (pick one of agility, strength, or speed. And lean on it as your main damage stat. Strenght for tai and weapons, agility for throwing and 'certain' weapons, and control for jutsu
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Allllllright, I
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: ..am up!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (your starting perk should compliment your build)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (jus freeball ur build fr
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (after all it does make your build overall cheaper)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (I remmeber the days when those used to be entirely random and you had to PRAY you didn't roll a useless perk
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (i preferred that tbh
