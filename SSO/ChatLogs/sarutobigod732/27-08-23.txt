<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) instictively rushed to Sakuya's defense and took the brunt of the blow!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Damage?)
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) just reduced their health by a cost of Light Damage - 4 / 6
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Stop that!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) As the white-haired dancer swings at her, Sakuya quickly parries the punch with her arm. Seizing the moment, she throws a punch right back, aiming for the dancer&#39;s midsection...Is what she would have done but her cousin saved her oddly.

<font color = white>&#34;Rather rude of you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between the two Senjus and white haired dancer. Was this an altercation brewing in real time. Perhaps something needed to be done to calm the tensions.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys, umm, how about we all just take a moment to cool off? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) crushed through the youngster&#39;s defenses, but found herself parried off-- Or something.

Someone got hit for the shit talking, so she let it be for now with scowling, red eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one calling people names.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighed and shook her head, <font color = white>&#34;I thought you guys were just being friendly. What do we actually call you then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: Is this not for the enrollments?
<br><font color=red>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) increases their health by Heavy Damage - 5.96 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Kamiya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) nervously watched the few bicker amongst themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...&#34;</font> is all he could manage to get out, deciding to not get in the middle of things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A pleasure to meet you Kamiya!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Swallowing her pride, she steps forward with her hand extended in a gesture of apology.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</font> she says sincerely, looking into the dancer&#39;s eyes. <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to offend you. If I&#39;ve said or done something to upset you, I apologize.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am not sure what I said as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gsaze as he never exactly got his question answered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Pfew. Glad that&#39;s sorted out. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) yawned, what a morning it had been already, just idly passing the time. She would just glance over to the girl next to her briefly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. We haven&#39;t spoken before but since we&#39;re standing here. I&#39;m Okiku.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) glad the fighting stopped. She would've just kept taking punches for either student until she passed out. Crisis averted.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sorry my cousin is aloof as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) squinted between them, obviously suspicious of the apology and pleasant greetings. Darting eyes warily regarded the hand gesture. This was the second weirdo to say something and then pretend they didn&#39;t know it&#39;d be a problem. Shoulders roll, dislocating and then -popping- back into place as she maintained her expression, despite the pain that should have caused.

<font color = white>&#34;... fine.&#34;</font> She mumbled, carefully taking her hand.</font></font></font>
