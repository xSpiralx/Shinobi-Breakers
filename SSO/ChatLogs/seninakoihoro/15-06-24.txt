<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) looked over the flower and listened to the feather. She would think about it for a moment. <font color = white>&#34;Hmm.. hospital help? Sure that sounds like fun! I might be one of the common visitors.&#34;</font> 

Her hands shoot out and shake them infront of her with a blush. <font color = white>&#34;N-Not like I like huritng myself or anything! But I-I tend to be hurt more times than naught.&#34;</font>

She reached her hand out toward the feather. <font color = white>&#34;Im Chobina by the way.&#34;</font> As if she had whiplash she turned toward the heavy breathing kid. <font color = white>&#34;Hey Bro!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) relaxed her posture a little and tucked her hands into the long, flowing sleeves of her outfit.

<font color = white>&#34;I will become the greatest medical shinobi to ever live.&#34;</font>

A humble goal on a humble head, apparently.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) stares over across the watery platform to an explicitly recognizable face. He moves out from behind the two larger figures&#39; bodies so that his target could match his gaze.
He extends a hand, albeit returns it to his person quickly, not wanting to call the wrong attention. He really should simply just--call out her name.

<font color = white>&#34;....!!!&#34;</font> He waves meekly, nothing more.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mm..also no problem at all... healing you is our duty even if its a paper cut Chobina
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Hehe, thank you~ I know im in good hands~
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) the young man walk up doing was looked like a jog although it was only a fast walk. He&#39;d place his hands upon his knees and exhale heavily a few times. He&#39;d look up and spot his sister.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah there you &#34;</font> Takes a deep breath <font color = white>&#34;Are What&#39;chu doin&#39;&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-also as long as you train hard enough Shuye!....you will become a great medical shi-...or not...not that you cant...just its..complicated...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: to rush out of your comfortzone...to heal someone in the heat of battle...is...not for eveyone mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) felt like she was already friends with her family. So her kinship with Ume was closed rather quicktly. <font color = white>&#34;I know I can count on you Ume,  and I will help out where I can to!&#34;</font> The girl leaned on Ume affectionatly but was concerned about her size. Maybe they needed to eat more. 

Her eyes then dart to Chonamu. <font color = white>&#34;Im talking to a family member! They are drawing a flyer! Then, uh, Ms. Shuye came in becase of their medical interest! So far its been a fun night!&#34;</font> 

She snickers a bit.<font color = white>&#34; But I think I can make it more fun! I want to be an artist myself.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) caught sight of the teal-haired boy in the background. Her red eyes flicked on him, made contact-- then looked away, as if trying to ignore him for the moment. You wouldn&#39;t know it by looking at her, but she was wrestling with whether to acknowledge him or not without forcing him to speak up. It was her job as the eldest to simultaneously protect and push him, after all. She wasn&#39;t sure which needed to be done today.

Her eyes turned toward the other girl having a conversation with Cho-ko. An Akimichi, both by introduction and obvious physical traits. She didn&#39;t even need to turn around to know the one opposite her was also one. They were large, which-- Shuye could never encourage.

But then, that was important for their clan, right? It had to be. Surely they were not all gluttons without reason. Without realizing it, Shuye had begun scowling at the chubby, black girl rather intensely, and opted not to acknowledge her meek brother. Her following words pretty clearly suggested that Shuye had done a lot of growing up far, far too quickly. She turned her eyes back toward Chokoume.

<font color = white>&#34;I think I can handle that. I just hope no idiots abuse that and get themselves hurt for no good reason. Once you break a pot, it&#39;ll never be the same.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [her own meek brother* just to clarify that wasn't directed at HBK]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <i>'Now would be the time to get annoyed.... Right?'</i>

Nah, the girl's scowl gave a clear indicator on where exactly she held him in this interaction. Besides, there's no emergency, he gets to see her consistently anyway--it's not like she's gonna just... Up and disappear anyway.

So, the boy pats his trousers, settles down on the dusted edge of the poolside--little feet dangling off the edge. And, he waits, patiently. Though the patience subsides rather quickly, his stare exudes ferocity, unbeknownst to himself of course. Glaring daggers into the masses while he sits and waits.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would feel a bit taken a back at the notion...though...

<font color = white>&#34;mhm..trama is definately a thing....we dont really have a...area for checking the mental state of our people.....mm..&#34;</font>

She found herself to be a bit at a loss...as she pondered on it...but soon felt the intense s-...scowl...that just registered within her brain a momento later. THough by the time she looked up to them...she noticed them staring back at her. 

<font color = white>&#34;but that would be just spreading our forces too thin...so maybe..once we have people to fill that area..&#34;</font> SHe paused...<font color = white>&#34; Then theres..division specific...&#34;</font>

She heard the kicking against the solid pavement that the razer-lashed boy was making.. <font color = white>&#34;specific....&#34;</font> It was then she felt the glaring daggers from behind her...<font color = white>&#34; s-specfic missions..?...&#34;</font> Her eyes closed as she then after sweatdropped. 

Her pen rested on her clippboard as she spoke. <font color = white>&#34;um..are you sure you dont have anything...important to take care of?&#34;</font> She asked a bit curiously..her eyes opening to give them a reassuring smile.</font></font></font>

She looked down at herself. She wasnt hurt or anything.

<font color = white>&#34;A medical lisence? Maybe... It depends on what we need!&#34;</font> She got distracted. <font color = white>&#34;Maybe I can make games that will cheer up the patients! I know its boring moping in hospitals all day. I dont know what I want to do yet, but I will help the hospital anyway I can!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) 's eyelashes rose revealing a terryfing array of melted gold laid aggressively amongst his irises. With it, his eyes shrunk, further fueling any sense of discomfort one may have had with his brief antics.

The slimmer Akimichi's smile definitely confirmed that she was speaking to him--which, kind of sort of dissolved any semblance he had of remaining patient and obtuse.

Stumbling to his feet, the boy bowed furiously, seemingly attempting to display some sense of apolgy, though after he was finished bowing....
His eyes continued to burn hellfire within the group, definitely seems like something he can't discourage on his own.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned. Mental states...? What the hell was she talking about? Shuye was interested in mending bones, not moods. Her attentioned turned next to Chobina--

<font color = white>&#34;Like what?&#34;</font> She asked, confused. There&#39;s no apology, which might have been odd-- or at least a little confrontational. <font color = white>&#34;You look okay to me.&#34;</font> She would then, finally, turn her attention on the boy between them since it had been pointed out by the other girl.

She would move away from the Akimichi, then. As a nearly-fully-fledged-rookie-ninja, jumping the distance of the arena&#39;s edges was no trouble at all! She landed next to him softly. Her eyes leveled on him, searching to meet with his own. Then she smiled disarmingly, for the first time since she&#39;d shown up.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you for being patient.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would relax and look over to Ume as the conversation finished. <font color = white>&#34;Are you ok?&#34;</font> She seemed rather concerned.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;..pol....lad...ght? C...do....m....ead?&#34;</font> His voice was practically nonexistent, which didn&#39;t help with the fact that it &lt;i&gt;sounded&lt;/i&gt; like he spouts venom with every utterance. Though, to clarify it looks like he&#39;s asking Shuye to apologize for him, since he believes his apology didn&#39;t pull through.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept locking eyes with her little brother. He almost sounded feral, the way he talked. Dripping with emotion, but trying to claw it back. Screaming, but barely above a whisper. Nothing new. An everyday struggle. A jade was a jade, no matter how much settled upon it&#39;s surface. It could always be cut to a finer edge. A brilliant luster. What it was meant to be. Shuye is left to decide whether an aplogy is even necessary, as she doubted others around here would be able to translate him.

When she noticed the heavy breathing boy behind him, Shuye&#39;s reaction is subtle but intentional. She reached out to her younger brother and grasped his hand firmly; almost maternally, rather than sisterly. She pulled him gently toward her, lest he turn around and notice how close the other boy was now.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course, dìdì.&#34;</font> She finally answered. <font color = white>&#34;Choko, my brother didn&#39;t mean to stare. He&#39;s sorry for upsetting you.&#34;</font> Shuye said in an even tone, looking to the only real ninja in this whole gathering for approval.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) took a sudden glance up above to the character resting themselves upon a rooftop. He wonders to himself how she got up there with ease, which prompts him to stare for... A while.

A few moments pass, before Meixun recognizes that he&#39;s falling into the same trap he always does, so this time: he attempts to speak.

&lt;i&gt; <font color = white>&#34;...ell....ooft....dy...!&#34;</font>&lt;/i&gt; 
Cried out  a sinister voice, a soft wave was given alongside it.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) asks: What's happenin', and why's that person on top of the building?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) peered down from her spot on top of the building, barely catching on to the fact someone was vying for her attention.

<font color = white>&#34;Mm?&#34;</font>

A book was placed in her lap, and a hand kept atop it to keep it secure whilst she looked elsewhere.

<font color = white>&#34;Howdy. &#39;N &#39;cause ah felt like bein&#39; up here, s&#39;all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) asks: H...'d ...ou....t u.....ere?
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Odd place to hang out, but okay.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Climbed. Ain' that hard.
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Just don't jump.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <b>''Just climbed''</b> Huh? Well, it makes sense for lack of a better rate. So, the boy takes up upon the suggested challenge--circling the building with heavy steps in order to scrape up some sort of process to begin climbing up alongside the scuffed girl.
Given that he's significantly younger, shorter, more than likely less experienced than the girl, there's not much of an avenue for him to begin properly. So, the boy settles to moving on the rooftop though the lanturn on the ground. Hopping atop the object to gain some height, crouching down, and cathopping over to the first tiled dome of the roof.

... He doesn't make it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: . . . .ow..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) watched the boy pace around for a moment, wondering if he even could. Well, she got her answer soon enough, and offered a gentle sigh. She did indeed have him beat in age, and experience-- scaling the building was a fairly trivial thing, even if she wasn&#39;t a Shinobi... Yet.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;need t&#39;get a grip&#39;n hoist yerself up.&#34;</font>

Her book was shuffled into a pouch on her flank, and she pushed off the building&#39;s rim, sliding slowly along the angled roof with seemingly little concern for herself. Upon reaching the very edge, she lowered herself, and gripped a hand to the roofing, using that connection to pivot her onto the lower roof, and subsequently onto the ground itself.

<font color = white>&#34;Hard t&#39;do &#39;cause o&#39; the angle&#39;n all, but ye oughta be able t&#39;do it with some practice.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) snickered softly as he watched the light blue haired boy slip and fail trying to climb the building along side of the woman who was on top. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.&#34;</font> he uttered. He moved over to the boy and extended his hand hoping to help the boy off of the ground.
<font color = white>&#34;Geez man, climbin&#39; ain&#39;t for everyone it seems.&#34;</font> he joked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (ok my internet is stil alive)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) A hiss escapes the boy&#39;s lips, now that the trio was in closer proximity--it seems the lack of explicit wording simply stems from proximity. 
<font color = white>&#34;Thank you very..... much..&#34;</font> He initiated with accepting help offered by the dark-skinned teen, stretching slightly while he utilized the boy&#39;s support to rise up. His face kept a mean streak, peering at both of them for a few moments before fluttering his eyes to speak up again.

Though, now that the girl was right in front of him, nothing short of <i>intimidation</i> fueled his words. She was literally twice his size! Is she a Shinobi? How long has she been in the fields? How much has she been hiding behind the guise of a simple--Questions completely subdued the boy&#39;s words for a much longer period than he&#39;d hope for.

<font color = white>&#34;....! Tall.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) -- The buy had already been picked up. Good. Not that she outwardly projected any empathy for his plights.

<font color = white>&#34;Aye, m&#39;like, twice yer age, probably. Oughta be taller, then.&#34;</font>

She guesstimated, and didn&#39;t really care if she got it wrong. It was mostly a dry joke.

<font color = white>&#34;Try climbin&#39; easier stuff &#39;till ye can reach properly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) pats the boy on the back as he finally got off the ground. Though, Kuni was confused when the boy spoke and said &#39;Tall&#39; his eyes followed to where he was looking at and his eyes landed on the woman from the building and surprising enough she did quite have some height to her. <font color = white>&#34;Huh..&#34;</font> he muttered surprised. He moved over to sized up the woman, looking at her up and down and moving around her body just to gauge how truly tall she was.
<font color = white>&#34;Hm...&#34;</font> he said as he moved around her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: There were not... Many places to grasp.. Without excess..... Perhaps.. The gate could be eas...easier..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) just kind of stood there as she was inspected, seemingly not caring all too much. Given the scarred state of her being, she was most likely used to the occasional squint, and stare.

Of course, a lone eye kept watch of the dark-skinned teen all the same.

<font color = white>&#34;Gate&#39;s cursed fer now. Wouldn&#39; suggest tryin&#39;.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (It has layer issues.)

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Eyup. Oughta prove more yer speed. Some with rocky outcrops t'latch onto.
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Yohkey..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) had just finished up his examination, and just had a few questions for the woman.
<font color = white>&#34;Hm.. What do you eat in a day to day?
What&#39;s the trainin&#39; regimen?
Do you climb often?
Were you born to climb buildings?
Do you really think that kid over there could climb just like you?
Did you stretch before climbing?
Are you in the academy?
Well I guess I&#39;m to late but, what ya name?
Do you have any special climbing gear?&#34;</font>
And thus ended the kids bombardment of questions, hopefully she kept up with them all since all of his questions were important.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) came under assault by a flurry of questions! This caused a measure of surprise, not used to that quantity of things to keep track of. Still, she offered her replies.

<font color = white>&#34;Whatever ah can afford. Usually some combo o&#39; rice&#39;n pork.
Don&#39; got one, really. Just jog &#39;n climb stuff.
Aye.
Nah.
Aye, if he puts in some effort.

INHALE. She&#39;d succeeded in one breath, somehow.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: So, you are... not yet a Shinobi..?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) reached out her own hand to complete the shake.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) gave a revolutionarily hard leer to Iroha&#39;s scars once more, now the question of how she got to where she is now proved to irk his mind. Though, for all intents and purposes--most of all being since she was already bombarded with questions, Meixun held his tongue.

<font color = white>&#34;I.... Am named Meixun....&#34;</font> He concludes, assuming the duo would&#39;ve liked his name as well.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) had felt the aspirant&#39;s presence for a while, though didn&#39;t choose acknowledge it as the youth didn&#39;t seem to be very active. Once the presence began moving; the boy&#39;s eyes glare across to his left.

<font color = white>&#34;He...o.&#34;</font> He announced, obviously stating hello, though his voice doesn&#39;t like to travel it seems.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) lifts a floor bound gaze toward the razor lashed boy and eventually offers a gentle nod. His hand is then raised as it&#39;s balled up into a fist only to float a mere inch away from his lips.

A grunt of sorts escaping him as he cleared his throat, lowering the now relaxing hand.
  <font color = white>&#34;Have you seen a long haired fellow?&#34;</font>, he questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;. . .?&#34;</font> Took a few seconds to prod at his own locks.... Nah, his hair isn&#39;t long enough--his gaze hones on Iroha. Her&#39;s is though.

Releasing his hair, he uses the occupied hand to point over to the scuffed girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) observes the boy's contemplation for a while only to follow to where his inevitable train of thought led him. With the scuffed girl now in sight he'd allow his gaze to linger for a moment.

His lack of change in expression didn't give any clues toward interpretation for what he may have been thinking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) says: . . .
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) eventually shakes his head. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s a male.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (Ack, sorry.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) offered a shake of her head. It wasn&#39;t the first time she&#39;d been stared at, and seemingly didn&#39;t car much.

<font color = white>&#34;Gotta be a lil&#39; more specific.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) blinks as the razor lashed boy spoke up once more. <font color = white>&#34;...?&#34;</font>
Confused slowly worked it&#39;s way along his visage before he&#39;d step closer once more.
            <font color = white>&#34;---&#34;</font>  -  Before he could speak clearer words from the girl are let loose as she once again gains his attention.

        <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m looking for Yurei.&#34;</font>, he clarified.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) seemed to think for a couple of seconds, a hand rising to her chin.

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) says: Mm.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#7d7280>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) <font color = white>&#34;Thank you.&#34;</font> 
He&#39;d say offering the both of them a nod. Soon, light footsteps carry him off deeper into the village.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: I will... Take my leave now.... Iroha-Sahn. I plan on... meeting with... my Eldest Sister.
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Thank you very.... Much for speaking with me.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) strolled down the main road to the gate, dark eyes drifting to the two gathered by the gate. His hands stayed in his pockets as he twiddled his fingers together. An abnormal bulge could be seen in his sweatshirt. 

He leapt up to the plateau near him, eyeing the two suspiciously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) gave a bow to the girl before turning on his heels to head toward where he has grown to believe most people are located--or, well the place he last saw his sister. He gives a short nodded bow to the Tsuchigumo who recently arrived, though doesn't stray on his path.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) is suddenly running RIGHT up toward the six armed girl, completely in shock now. His bright eyes scanning her like crazy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve seen some people like you around before but I still didn&#39;t really believe it-- did-- did you know that...&#34;</font>

There&#39;s a dramatic pause.

<font color = white>&#34; .. You&#39;ve got SIX ARMS?!&#34;</font> he exclaims.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: You don't leave your house much do you?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: I leave my house tons! I just look at the ground more than I look at people.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: I'm always on another adventure. Gotta find the best rocks out there to bring home!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: --
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hahaha, well okay then.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) turns to look at the guy who moves up behind her and pauses for a moment, huuuuh?

<font color = white>&#34;Yes?  I got six arms.  What&#39;s wrong with that?  It&#39;s a family trait.  And I didn&#39;t know that...&#34;</font>

Though she noticed that someone else was beside her, was she popilar already?  Was she already winning in life?  Wao, so exciting!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would slowly begin to draw each marking..one by one on the tiles of the sparing  mattt.  

She felt she wasent going finish her notice for a while...and felt like giving the academy students..something to do asside from playing dice if they wanted! 

Though this game wasent f-...this obstical course wasent for the faint of heart. She was indeed waiting for her peers to awaken...but what mroe could she do but entertain while she was on the payroll!

<font color = white>&#34;a-ah..&#34;</font>

She then turned to face the others and placed a hand on her hips!

<font color = white>&#34;This is the academy obstical version two....if would like to  partake please head to the starting line....this is not a drill...&#34;</font> She paused. <font color = white>&#34;but dont feel forced...this is more of a voulnteer sort of deal..&#34;</font> The medic soon stretched a bit before lowering their arms to their side.

<font color = white>&#34;if i remeber correctly..the rules are as followed&#34;</font>

== Rules below ===

[Roll 20 Sided Die] [ 1-5 hit] [ 6- 10 graze] [ 11 - 15  semi miss] [ 16 - 20 miss]

hit =  move back 2 tile 
 
graze = move back 1 tile 

semi-miss =  neutral

miss = One extra tile movement forwards

<font color = white>&#34;you can make a action that would delay your opponents movement, but make sure your judgement is correct or you will just be giving your opponent a window to win..mhm&#34;</font>  

She paused for a moment. <font color = white>&#34; Everyone is born with a different set of luck...this is just to see how lucky you are in this life..and what risks you should take on your future missions..mhm...so if you wish to do it..have fun with it&#34;</font>

His eyes slowly shift toward the albino and he narrows his gaze on them silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Hm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) &#39;s eyes are LIT UP when she responds to him. He couldn&#39;t believe it. They were real. Without so much as skipping a beat, both of his hands are balled into tight fists as he begins to shake them from the excitement.

<font color = white>&#34; You can literally count to thirty with all of your hands!! That is so cool! You&#39;re so cool! You can also scoop up so many more rocks at a time than me...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She teases the two-toned one.</font></font></font>

THe fluffyness hit her once more as she face planted onto the gound rolling before coming to a spot. She slowly struggled to pick her self up as her hair turned into a bed head hair.

She smelled the chocolate....

w-was this a friendship offering!...distracting her with a moment of weakness for a toad to jump kick her in a combo attack....

Himeki was a crafty girl mhm...who exactly did she learn this from..mhm

With a shrug, he waves his hand toward Himeki and calls out to her,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) scrambled back on her feet, seeing the leery boy nearly overtake her! Over her dead body, she would let him! Now they were neck, and neck.</font></font></font>

Keen eyes narrow upon the girl in front, the one with the light-purple hair. A whip of arm launched a pebble right for their forehead.

<font color = white>&#34;WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! MY RACE!&#34;</font> she exclaimed.

<font color = white>&#34;A decent way of looking at it. So. Did you get held back a year or two? Or.. did you get a late start?&#34;</font>

A moment&#39;s spent gazing across the moat, at all their peers, before refocusing on the tall one. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the latter. I gave up on learning my family&#39;s... <i>primary business</i> to do this. Never too late to start learning how to do violence for profit. Right?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

While Shuye is temporarily keeping her attention off of him, he gives a few 'knowing' winks over toward the other kid's way. He has NO idea who he even is, but he's convinced himself... He will show the fellow kid the way before too long.</font></font></font>

Yeah, that sounds like the kind of personal matters anyone with basic common decency shouldn&#39;t ask about. So he didn&#39;t!

<font color = white>&#34;I see. Well. Best of luck to you, in your future laden with dodging rocks for the rest of the year. I won&#39;t go easy on you, if the legal opportunity finds me again,&#34;</font> he told them, wearing an unseen grin. </font></font></font>

He could continue deeper if he'd wish, though it'd more than likely lead him to some unnecessary detailing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s listened to the offer given before taking a short breath. Just as she exhaled, her once somber demeanour had changed. Her eyes were piercing as she looked toward the boy.
