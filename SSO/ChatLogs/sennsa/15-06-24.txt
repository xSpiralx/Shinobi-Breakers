<br><font color=green>*Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Hm
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: ...! H..
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) asks: What's happenin', and why's that person on top of the building?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) peered down from her spot on top of the building, barely catching on to the fact someone was vying for her attention.

<font color = white>&#34;Mm?&#34;</font>

A book was placed in her lap, and a hand kept atop it to keep it secure whilst she looked elsewhere.

<font color = white>&#34;Howdy. &#39;N &#39;cause ah felt like bein&#39; up here, s&#39;all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) asks: H...'d ...ou....t u.....ere?
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Odd place to hang out, but okay.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Climbed. Ain' that hard.
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Just don't jump.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <b>''Just climbed''</b> Huh? Well, it makes sense for lack of a better rate. So, the boy takes up upon the suggested challenge--circling the building with heavy steps in order to scrape up some sort of process to begin climbing up alongside the scuffed girl.
Given that he's significantly younger, shorter, more than likely less experienced than the girl, there's not much of an avenue for him to begin properly. So, the boy settles to moving on the rooftop though the lanturn on the ground. Hopping atop the object to gain some height, crouching down, and cathopping over to the first tiled dome of the roof.

... He doesn't make it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: . . . .ow..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) watched the boy pace around for a moment, wondering if he even could. Well, she got her answer soon enough, and offered a gentle sigh. She did indeed have him beat in age, and experience-- scaling the building was a fairly trivial thing, even if she wasn&#39;t a Shinobi... Yet.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;need t&#39;get a grip&#39;n hoist yerself up.&#34;</font>

Her book was shuffled into a pouch on her flank, and she pushed off the building&#39;s rim, sliding slowly along the angled roof with seemingly little concern for herself. Upon reaching the very edge, she lowered herself, and gripped a hand to the roofing, using that connection to pivot her onto the lower roof, and subsequently onto the ground itself.

<font color = white>&#34;Hard t&#39;do &#39;cause o&#39; the angle&#39;n all, but ye oughta be able t&#39;do it with some practice.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) snickered softly as he watched the light blue haired boy slip and fail trying to climb the building along side of the woman who was on top. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.&#34;</font> he uttered. He moved over to the boy and extended his hand hoping to help the boy off of the ground.
<font color = white>&#34;Geez man, climbin&#39; ain&#39;t for everyone it seems.&#34;</font> he joked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (ok my internet is stil alive)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) A hiss escapes the boy&#39;s lips, now that the trio was in closer proximity--it seems the lack of explicit wording simply stems from proximity. 
<font color = white>&#34;Thank you very..... much..&#34;</font> He initiated with accepting help offered by the dark-skinned teen, stretching slightly while he utilized the boy&#39;s support to rise up. His face kept a mean streak, peering at both of them for a few moments before fluttering his eyes to speak up again.

Though, now that the girl was right in front of him, nothing short of <i>intimidation</i> fueled his words. She was literally twice his size! Is she a Shinobi? How long has she been in the fields? How much has she been hiding behind the guise of a simple--Questions completely subdued the boy&#39;s words for a much longer period than he&#39;d hope for.

<font color = white>&#34;....! Tall.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) -- The buy had already been picked up. Good. Not that she outwardly projected any empathy for his plights.

<font color = white>&#34;Aye, m&#39;like, twice yer age, probably. Oughta be taller, then.&#34;</font>

She guesstimated, and didn&#39;t really care if she got it wrong. It was mostly a dry joke.

<font color = white>&#34;Try climbin&#39; easier stuff &#39;till ye can reach properly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) pats the boy on the back as he finally got off the ground. Though, Kuni was confused when the boy spoke and said &#39;Tall&#39; his eyes followed to where he was looking at and his eyes landed on the woman from the building and surprising enough she did quite have some height to her. <font color = white>&#34;Huh..&#34;</font> he muttered surprised. He moved over to sized up the woman, looking at her up and down and moving around her body just to gauge how truly tall she was.
<font color = white>&#34;Hm...&#34;</font> he said as he moved around her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) just kind of stood there as she was inspected, seemingly not caring all too much. Given the scarred state of her being, she was most likely used to the occasional squint, and stare.

Of course, a lone eye kept watch of the dark-skinned teen all the same.

<font color = white>&#34;Gate&#39;s cursed fer now. Wouldn&#39; suggest tryin&#39;.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (It has layer issues.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (damn fr?)
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Eyup. Oughta prove more yer speed. Some with rocky outcrops t'latch onto.
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) had just finished up his examination, and just had a few questions for the woman.
<font color = white>&#34;Hm.. What do you eat in a day to day?
What&#39;s the trainin&#39; regimen?
Do you climb often?
Were you born to climb buildings?
Do you really think that kid over there could climb just like you?
Did you stretch before climbing?
Are you in the academy?
Well I guess I&#39;m to late but, what ya name?
Do you have any special climbing gear?&#34;</font>
And thus ended the kids bombardment of questions, hopefully she kept up with them all since all of his questions were important.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) came under assault by a flurry of questions! This caused a measure of surprise, not used to that quantity of things to keep track of. Still, she offered her replies.

<font color = white>&#34;Whatever ah can afford. Usually some combo o&#39; rice&#39;n pork.
Don&#39; got one, really. Just jog &#39;n climb stuff.
Aye.
Nah.
Aye, if he puts in some effort.
Sometimes.
Nay yet.
Iroha.
Just gloves&#39;n boots.&#34;</font>

INHALE. She&#39;d succeeded in one breath, somehow.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Nope.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) nods along as she surprisingly handles the onslaught of questions he had for her. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m impressed, didn&#39;t think you would answer all of them.&#34;</font> he said with a smile as he extended his palm. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kunigami, nice ta meet ya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) reached out her own hand to complete the shake.

<font color = white>&#34;Ain&#39; like y&#39;were askin&#39; anythin&#39; funky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) gave a revolutionarily hard leer to Iroha&#39;s scars once more, now the question of how she got to where she is now proved to irk his mind. Though, for all intents and purposes--most of all being since she was already bombarded with questions, Meixun held his tongue.

<font color = white>&#34;I.... Am named Meixun....&#34;</font> He concludes, assuming the duo would&#39;ve liked his name as well.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: True but most folks wouldn't be able to handle the preesure so that's why I'm impressed.
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Nice ta meet ya too, Meixun.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) had felt the aspirant&#39;s presence for a while, though didn&#39;t choose acknowledge it as the youth didn&#39;t seem to be very active. Once the presence began moving; the boy&#39;s eyes glare across to his left.

<font color = white>&#34;He...o.&#34;</font> He announced, obviously stating hello, though his voice doesn&#39;t like to travel it seems.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) lifts a floor bound gaze toward the razor lashed boy and eventually offers a gentle nod. His hand is then raised as it&#39;s balled up into a fist only to float a mere inch away from his lips.

A grunt of sorts escaping him as he cleared his throat, lowering the now relaxing hand.
  <font color = white>&#34;Have you seen a long haired fellow?&#34;</font>, he questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) shot a suspicious glance at the troubleaker.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) clicks his teeth together while exuding a yawn. He notices a few people here and there but not many. What an interesting day it has become.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Or maybe the opposite since the village is huge.
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Anyways I hope the fella finds 'em.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Eyup. Meixun went t'see his sister o' somethin'.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: S'bout all.
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Okay so everyone went to go find a relative, gotcha.
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) asks: What about you, Iroha? Got any missin' family members?
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Nope.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The leery boy-T0r1x)

Now that was a good idea. The boy deftly scrambled down the plateau and wandered off into the village.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Rocks are good for you though.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: If you eat rocks, I will punch you after you eat them. In the rocks.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You need minerals and stuff in your diet.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: See-- wait?!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Why would you do that?!

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: So you can learn how bad it is to eat rocks.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah, that Hideo guy gets it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Everyone should always listen to me!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a laugh.
<font color = white>&#34;A decent way of looking at it. So. Did you get held back a year or two? Or.. did you get a late start?&#34;</font>

A moment&#39;s spent gazing across the moat, at all their peers, before refocusing on the tall one. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the latter. I gave up on learning my family&#39;s... <i>primary business</i> to do this. Never too late to start learning how to do violence for profit. Right?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh, not too sure what I like doin' for fun.

<font color = white>&#34;Likewise fer me. Couldn&#39; walk fer a year. That didn&#39; help. But ah got better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) takes a deep breath and and exhales.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) blinked a few times before looking the boy up and down.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned at Venturo. Then she turned to her brothjer.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t let me catch you eating rocks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Eat as many rocks as you want...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) takes a step back and stands next to Meixun and nudges his awake.
<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be fallin&#39; asleep out here, dude. You might get eaten.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) eyes her up and down returning the energy.

<font color = white>&#34;Ill give you an allowance and you&#39;ll get to make me sandwhiches. That sound good?&#34;</font> He asks with a grin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) ||
While Shuye is temporarily keeping her attention off of him, he gives a few 'knowing' winks over toward the other kid's way. He has NO idea who he even is, but he's convinced himself... He will show the fellow kid the way before too long.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: Hey i could go for a sandwhich.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wish I had an allowance...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I want a sandwich.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I know a sandwich sounds good..Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Reilin!  I will adopt you for sandwiches!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) tilted his head. Err. Couldn&#39;t walk for a year-- 
Yeah, that sounds like the kind of personal matters anyone with basic common decency shouldn&#39;t ask about. So he didn&#39;t!

<font color = white>&#34;I see. Well. Best of luck to you, in your future laden with dodging rocks for the rest of the year. I won&#39;t go easy on you, if the legal opportunity finds me again,&#34;</font> he told them, wearing an unseen grin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: My new wife is making us all sandwiches..Just put your order in!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Get me three.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Gonna eat like an Akimichi tonight!  YAHOOO!

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I can at times.  Six arms gives a gal quite an appetite!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: Hmm Since its Lunch....
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: ... Now I -really- wish I had six arms...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Six arms would be kinda cool...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: I'll take 22 of the previous order please and thank you.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) moved on as briskly as that, offering no explanation for her extended spot of immobility.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was in a different state of mind when he's.... Focusing. He didn't even acknowledge his new acquaintances' remark, his body simply reacting to the forces with no reply.

Everyone's chakra felt the same, regardless of si--well, no.... Some people's chakra felt, subdued. Though the child still wasn't able to pinpoint exactly who was causing the... Discrepancy within his memory.
He could continue deeper if he'd wish, though it'd more than likely lead him to some unnecessary detailing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s listened to the offer given before taking a short breath. Just as she exhaled, her once somber demeanour had changed. Her eyes were piercing as she looked toward the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.. Who tha&#39; heck do ya&#39; take me for? Some kinda&#39; bum? Only one here who&#39;s gonna be makin&#39; sandwiches fer&#39; you is yer&#39; mum. Now buzz off &#39;fore I throw ya&#39; in the water!&#34;</font> she retorted. Her tone was vulgar and riddled with slang. Her once prim-and-proper way of speaking had vanished at the drop of a hat and she&#39;d tilted her nose up, even if she were shorter she found a way to still look down her nose at the boy. She almost seemed like a bit of a delinquent in the moment.</font></font></font>
