<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) snorts, looking away with her arms crossed, displaying her indifference to his response. <font color = white>&#34;Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.&#34;</font> she said, eyes shut tightly. Then, she peeks with a single eye, and retorts, <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s no surprise a beast only finds their own kind attractive.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) whips his head back over to the smart alecky girl who hadn&#39;t refused to shut up even now.

Kaji does not mimic her pose, instead shoving a finger just under her chin. <font color = white>&#34;Well then behold,&#34;</font> His fingers press together and he snaps as if to get their attention. <font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s no beauty to be found here at all.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

During her outburst, she felt her grip loosen. The beige-haired youth's strength was naturally greater than her own, given their gender, and she was left wincing as the pain from her strained effort set in.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) yells: Get off!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) doesn&#39;t even allow the large boy to have a word before he begins speaking up, once more gesturing with his eyes to the now superior hold he has upon her. He finds that the tables have turned suddenly, though perhaps it wasn&#39;t good. <font color = white>&#34;Oh? Where&#39;s my please? My &#39;sorry for grabbing you&#39;, huh?&#34;</font> The scowl spreads out into a thin smirk. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) blinks a few times.. <font color = white>&#34;My sister says Girls never need a boy to save them....

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) &#39;s cheeks puffed as she found herself overwhelmed by the boy&#39;s superior might, beginning to regret ever starting the altercation to begin with. And now, with nowhere to flee, and no one to call upon, she saw herself in a big dilemma. Her eyes shut tightly, praying for assistance, but alas, none would come. She could only rely on herself and her own ability.
 <font color = white>&#34;I said... Get off me!&#34;</font> she screamed.

In a fury of emotions, she aimed to wrench her arms away from his hold, using every ounce of strength within her. As desperation fueled her actions, she swung her head forward, intending to collide their foreheads. The impact, though painful, created just enough distance between them. She staggered back, her breath ragged, eyes burning with defiance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) would hear a loud bang.. Chonamu&#39;s heavy breathing would stop <font color = white>&#34;Hey ..You two stop goofing off something is happening.&#34;</font>

The cubby kid dashes off to go see what all the commition was about.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) finds an increasingly amusing feeling surfacing from within. The inexplainable sensation thriving when face to face with the girl having realized she bit off more than she could currently chew. It didn&#39;t make him feel strong, no, he always knew boys were just better than girls at things like fighting.

But maybe it was just seeing her eat her words? That was possibly the reason he felt so pleased with the current situation. Of course it doesn&#39;t stay that way as while the dark haired, onyx eyed girl is attempting to wrestle her hand free, he is unaware of her second method. 

He crumples under the pressure of a forehead. <font color = white>&#34;You---! Fat headed, wide forehead! Aaaugh, did you break my skull!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) would prepare it appeared they were coming at him from both sides. It also Seemed that Katorra would be the first to reach him. Slow and Steady Wins the race..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) stopped in place now. She noticed that they should have engaged with each other quite some time ago. So she was a bit perplexed by the delay. Ideally she'd just bop them both consecutively, like a fly buzzing in the  background of a battle between titans. At least that's how she pictured it. Nevertheless her approach continued.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) retained unshakable serenity. Calm as the Moat Waters yonder while he closed the distance to the presumed Akimichi combatant. 

<font color = white>&#34;Are you any good at Taijutsu?&#34;</font>
A casual question&#39;s posed during the trip. Until...

...he dips, he darts, snatching for the kid&#39;s Ribbon like a Blank Mamba. If all went as planned? His fingers would sink into their Streamer like fangs to a Desert Hare. Yoink? We&#39;ll see.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) wasn't expecting Katora to be so strong when it came to striking speed. Much faster than she'd witnessed prior to this. Nevertheless, Chonamu seemed to be able to hold his own to a degree. Her slow approach continued. The way things were going she figured Chonamu would be defeated and Katora would then make quick work of her afterwards.

She pressed on.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Okay so that's Mugen.

     A palm became a stone splitting the rushing river that was the kid&#39;s Brutish Hand. Harmlessly smacking them in the wrist to divert the trajectory of their grab. Those fingers of theirs merely close around empty air. 

In turn? He drives a speedy jab directly for the kid&#39;s sternum.
<font color = white>&#34;Not bad. I can tell you hit decent hard.&#34;</font>
Compliments paid where they were due, while he side steps a tad. Keeping both of his enemies within sight.
