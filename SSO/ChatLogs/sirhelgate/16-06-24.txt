<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he rounds the bridge. A short wave given to the blue haired boy. <font color = white>&#34;Heya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) coughs once, mainly testing colors (ooc)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) looks up from the ground. He had been in deep thought <font color = white>&#34;Oh. Hi.&#34;</font> He said, dismissively. He was beginning to wonder how many new people he would have to interact with today.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would offer a short nod towards the bridge, <font color = white>&#34;Do you know where the majority of people have gathered?&#34;</font> The softer boy was a bit of a social butterfly it seemed. That or he wanted a crowd to dissapear into.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) sighed, waving his hand in no specific direction. <font color = white>&#34;They&#39;ve all dispersed for the most part.&#34;</font> He looked at what remained of the bridge, then looked around the boy. <font color = white>&#34;Where are you coming from, anyway? Don&#39;t you know it&#39;s dangerous to leave the village right now?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he looks around, and points back up north, <font color = white>&#34;I went to the bridge from over there. I thought there might be folks hanging out at the bridge today. So I wandered on down. Lookin&#39; a bit for my cousin or two.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) shrugged, clearly growing more uninterested in the conversation. <font color = white>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t know who your cousins are or where to find them for that matter.&#34;</font> He began to examine the boy more closely to discern if he looked like anyone he&#39;d met today.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (Is there anything I could discern from your appearance as to who you are related to?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) had pitch black hair, and very, very fair skin. It was hard to distinguish them from a girl come to think of it. Though they were dressed in a very traditional manner. The way they stood screamed &#39;don&#39;t mistake me for a girl.&#39; He would nod towards them, <font color = white>&#34;You sure?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: ( that should help
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) squinted and leaned forward slightly to make out the boy&#39;s features in the poor light. Then he groaned and rolled his eyes. <font color = white>&#34;Another Hyuuga?&#34;</font> He looked down at his feet and kicked a small rock, thinking to himself &#39;I just can&#39;t escape them today...&#39;</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) blinks at the other, walking forward with an almost quiet step. He would tilt his head to one side. His long black hair catching the wind. The sash he wore about his waist had the symbol of a snowflake stitched into the white. It was almost hard to see until the light caught the cross stitching. <font color = white>&#34;What? No, I am Aoi of the Yuki clan.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) looked back up at Aoi with a somewhat softer gaze. <font color = white>&#34;Oh. My mistake then.&#34;</font> He was willing to admit to his mistakes. This didn&#39;t change the fact that he had little patience left for people today.

<font color = white>&#34;Still, I haven&#39;t met anyone anyone else claiming to be affiliated with the Yuki clan.&#34;</font> He said boredly. Another glance told him this boy was younger than him by at least two years. <font color = white>&#34;You should really get somewhere safe. I doubt you&#39;d be able to hold your own if anyone had ill intentions.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: You do know the village was attacked, right?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink at that. Looking back across the bridge behind him. <font color = white>&#34;We were attacked? I had been sleeping in the past couple of days.&#34;</font> He tried his best to not look concerned, but the boy wasn&#39;t good at making his emotions all that cold. The look of concern was palpable. He bows his head swiftly and respectfully, <font color = white>&#34;Thankyou, I should get back in the village a bit further. What&#39;s your name If I might ask it?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirked slightly, <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, there&#39;s a scary robot scientist puppet hybrid going around taking little boys and turning them into abominations&#34;</font> He paused, before leaning forward slightly and in a lower tone saying <font color = white>&#34;Literally.&#34;</font>

He stood back up straight and said <font color = white>&#34;Sure would stink to get kidnapped and never see your family again!&#34;</font> He said half playfully, half seriously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (context: a scientist with odd limbs and eyes, containing the body of a young genin(?) came into the village on this bridge, blew it up and was defeated by a jounin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) to say he looked pale was a slight understatement. He was shook by the notion. He bought into the story pretty easily. It conjured images in his mind of a terrible puppiteer looming over a puppet version of himself. He would pull his hand to his mouth as he gasps out,

<font color = white>&#34;No...&#34;</font> 
He wounded in disbelief he looked over his shoulder and scooted back closer to the village for his own saftey. He wasn&#39;t able to hold a cool steely noble visage with such a horrible story!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (Stated they will keep taking boys and I believe said they are amond us currently
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (everyone loves a good horror story to kick off a wipe)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) chuckled softly. Though he was an egotistical prick at times, he had a soft spot for people younger than him. <font color = white>&#34;Just get somewhere safe with someone you trust and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be fine.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) Looks back and around and looked like he was worried. His voice almost cracking, <font color = white>&#34;I was looking for my cousins. Ain&#39;t no one else you can trust but family!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: That's a good way to look at it
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: "I doubt anything more will happen today. You should be okay."
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (about to leave for the night
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Sup.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (oh good did the profile stuff get fixed?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki(The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) OOCs: (iirc no?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (I wasn't aware of any issues tbh)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (I thought I saw someone say it was given 'em trouble. Ah well guess not)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (I'm out of here for the night, good luck)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would move to stand aside. And just generally holds a look of concern. Deciding to stay largely to the side of things for the time being.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) reaches down to inspect the bridge, their eyes scan across, checking the damage dealt. She hummed softly. <font color = white>&#34;Oh well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would nod over to the girl, <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s terrible! I can hardly believe the story....&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Yep.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Lucky I wasn't here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would look off to the water on the side. A little bit of his nerve recovering. He looks back, <font color = white>&#34;It seems most have turned in for the night too...&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Yep.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Must be tired.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Still unnerving to hear about...
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: the bridge attack.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: That's new.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) yells: Thanks there are some strong Jonin around to help!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Well, it's a positive note atleast.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Mh-hm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Indeed.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: hum...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Hmm... So quiet.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: I'm bored.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: yeah
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Yeeep.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: What'cher name?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Aoi, Aoi Yuki.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Good to meet you Mikazuki.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Mm, mm.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Well, I'm betting when the city is more awake. 
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: folks will be more interesting.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ....Hmmm... There was a tournament earlier.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: You, know. I was wonder how long this was going to last
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Yuki, Aoi has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) released a deep sigh as it would seem, the issue presented along the bridge had been  cleared up. There was no need for the village bells to continue ringing with the threat now gone, however the child wonder if a formal report was made about the incident. 

Moving over towards the edge of the water, he'd begin to gather his thoughts, slowly dissecting the details gathered from the event. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Yuki, Aoi has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: As I expected
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=red>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) increases their chakra by Full - 9 / 9.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Very much so.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Hey there
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) greets them with a short nod. <font color = white>&#34;Hello, Seems lots of folks have picked spots they like.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Hello
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) nodded his head, he was often seen standing under the shade of the tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hey.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Who are you three?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would smile faintly as he considers something. <font color = white>&#34;Well, I am Aoi.&#34;</font> He looks to the others, getting introductions out of the way.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Eh who am I?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) had looked over at the other two before returning his gaze back to the soft featured boy. 

<font color = white>&#34;Well it is very nice to meet you Aoi! My name is Tenjin.&#34;</font> he said.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) points a finger at the boy with yellow shoes. His eyes remain locked to the three other students. <font color = white>&#34;Take his shoes or receive punishment. You have three hours.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Well Tenjin and Aoi, I'm Kryu.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Time is ticking. I will return to see results.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) walks off with his hands joined together behind his back.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Nice to meet you too then Kryu
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he sees the other&#39;s shoes. Before looking away from the others. Pointing down to the other&#39;s yellow shoes. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you heard the jounin...&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Sorry Tenjin, but I'm going to need those.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) dashed his way underneath the tree's shade, adjusting his hat to keep the sun out of his eyes. It's apparent he's only here to be nosy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Im Daigen.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: What Jounin?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: One of the military commanders in the village. 
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: The crimson haired veteran looking guy.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: I am familiar with what a jounin is but what made that man look like a jounin to you?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Hmmm, his commanding tone? I could be wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I need ryo..Hrm.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Oh we're supposed to take your shoes?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: He seemed like a crazy old man to me.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Can you hand the over?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Ill give them back later.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: How about, if you give them to one of us, I'll make you something in the future. I do know how to tailor clothes.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I'm uncannily good with a sewing needle.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I would rather not give my shoes to a crazy person. Also I will never need anything made for me.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Listen, we're not giving him your shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I just asked.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Im not being aggressive.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I'm just trying to avoid the wrath of a crazy war veteran.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) tilted his head in confusion.

<font color = white>&#34;You are currently asking me to give my shoes to you. I suspect that you are doing that because of what the stranger commanded you to do.&#34;</font> he began. <font color = white>&#34;So if he commanded you to give him my shoes then I have no reason to believe that you would not. If anything I think that he and I are both curious where you would draw the line... Or if you would draw the line.&#34;</font> he elaborated as he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: ... I just asked for your shoes. I don't think its a big deal.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Your possessions are not being taken from you so I imagine it would not be a big deal for you Daigen.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: No one is taking anythihng from you though?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I have my doubts about that.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) yells: Yo, Daigen!
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hey  Bill.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: How you been man.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Ive been good. Just hanging out.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: What about you??
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) shrugs on that, with a little concerned look. The softness of his features, and his cold tone spoke that he really care. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m just trying to not get in trouble with a potential superior. If he&#39;s not a ranking Shinobi we can just ignore him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I was just watching a spar but its was kind of lame.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: What spar?
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Some kid in blue and a red head with a cord.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Care to show me?
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: If you want it's just south of here....but it's kid of lame.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a yawn as they returned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I'm gonna go check it out, if it's not boring anymore I'll come back and say so.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (I think he logged because I was taking too long lol
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Still boring.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Who are you two? I don't think we've ever met.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Three*
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oh. I'm Saigosame. Hi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) stepped back away from the group cautiously.

<font color = white>&#34;Tenjin.&#34;</font> he said plainly while keeping an eye on everyone.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) nodded, committing their two peers&#39; names to memory.
<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you two.&#34;</font>
They offered a slight wave to them before looking towards the third stranger, seeing if they were also going to introduce themselves.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I'm Bill.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill(The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) OOCs: also it happens man youll get the hang of combat)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) rose a brow. <font color = white>&#34;Bill. Bbbbbill. Bill. That&#39;s a funny name to say. It&#39;s good to meet you, Bill!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a small chuckle at the blue-skinned boy&#39;s actions.
<font color = white>&#34;I guess it is kind of funny to say if you ain&#39;t used to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) looks carefully at each individual standing around, before stopping his eyes on the soft featured boy. He cracked a smile, <font color = white>&#34;Aoi!&#34;</font> he said as he recognized one of the only people he liked so far. <font color = white>&#34;Did you see the nightmarish scientist? Did he try to get you yet?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: The hell is a scientist?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) glanced at Bill, pursing his lips slightly. <font color = white>&#34;What? Does no one keep up to date with things around here? A nightmarish, disturbing puppet housing the body of a genin came into our villages, committed terrorist attacks (blew up the bridge) and threatened to keep taking young boys for their experimentaion.&#34;</font> he said, stopping to catch his breath. <font color = white>&#34;You really should make an effort to know the goings-on around here. Otherwise, you just seem silly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (village, not villages. and attack, not attacks
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) eyed widen slightly at this news.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh, it seems I need to start reading the morning paper when I wake up.&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I don't think that ignorance makes someone silly.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Well, he isn't on the loose. That smelly, confusing Hyuuga took care of him.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: However, I think it's safe to say he isn't alone... Just don't go into the wilderness
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Masma. The Clan Head.

However do you think we should also establish some common rules to hold each other under as peers?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) genuinely started tweaking, <font color = white>&#34;Nah, this Najiro ninja dumb as hell and a coward at that!&#34;</font> Asa pushed up his glasses in an attempt to compose himself. <font color = white>&#34;Forgive me. I don&#39;t believe Najiro to be a good fit. It also can&#39;t be me, because I have disdain for the Hyuuga clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had seemingly appeared from nowhere; she was quite fast - even without the usage of a particular technique set. A softly thud could be noted as she came into focus, and within her hand she adorned an apple. 

She was gingerly eating it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm,&#34;</font>

She was just watching.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: thats true.But i will say it once more,you should know when to give up
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Before you decide to give up, you must first figure out what you truly fight for.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eyes rolled as he saw things were starting to steer out of control, <font color = white>&#34;Well I was thinking we should scout for grounds fitting to hold ugernt meetings, like grounds for voting and such... does anyone have any suggestions?&#34;</font>

It would be nice to have a location where everyone from the village is aware of and considered a safe ground for other to take refugee.

<font color = white>&#34;Anyone here have a suggestion?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Coward is someone who didn't even tried to attack.Giving up based on what you see is the right choice at times.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Meetings? You'll hear an announcement regarding that and a location.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Otherwise, I believe we are using the statue here or the area outside the Kage Building.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I got a question,outside of this topic
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) raised his hand, looking about the group.
<font color = white>&#34;I think we should put this down to a democratic vote, rather than someone simply claiming the position of class leader.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you have scrolls about the water walking jutsu? Is seems some students know the technique.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Class Leader? You should be looking to form squads, and figuring out a squad leader.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Suimen? Hm, I've never really used it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Also...isn't forming squads the job of chunins and jounins?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: But, we may have a few scrolls - you didn't ask them?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) shook his head, he was simply implaying as a community, they should decided on one that is per-say official.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And no,i just now realized i was not given scroll for the suimen,but i know the shushin
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Why am I forming the squad for you? I barely know any of the names you have.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: About well...the thing the last week with the blowing of the bridge and who did it
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Most likely,&#34;</font>

She replied, and motioned towards the nearby edge of the raised platform they were all stood upon. 

   <font color = white>&#34;But alas,&#34;</font>

She extended a hand - a simple motion and she weaved out a singular seal before she eased forth and motioned to fall from the edge. A softly thud of impact noted, and a visible hue of blue rippled from below her feet. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Like so,&#34;</font>

She shrugged. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Now let me write this down...,&#34;</font>

She quickly produced a small black-scroll from within her attire, and with agile grace, and speed she invoked the wrath of her newly obtained knowledge within the confines of it all. 

It didn&#39;t take long, and before she knew it? She was now standing within her space once more.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Why would a group of terrorist warn us? Also I'm certain our village Jounin would have bodied them for crossing our boarders.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Why warn anyone? Mental advantage.

<font color = white>&#34;Haha, right.&#34;</font>
The forced laughter was a painful reminder of the tension, a stark contrast to the attention they were trying to divert back to Chuunin Botan.
&#39;Ya, im targeting this kid first..&#39;
He thought to himself</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (I apologize to you all for this, I really do.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) smirked. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You first,&#34;</font>

A brief blur of speed could be noted, fragmented lines of fabric-color as she seemingly vanished in a singular huff of momentum-fueled movement. She appeared directly in front of Bill.

A word not uttered, and she motioned to push her hand forward so that she could lift him up and off the ground before promptly THROWING him behind her back and into the nearby water. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (>:D who gets bullied first.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Maybe that will help clear the smell...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) felt a blush creep up their face at the sudden closeness of the chuunin, and they froze as they watched them reach out for him.
<font color = white>&#34;Um Miss Bota-&#34;</font>
Whatever they had planned to say died in their throat as they felt the wind pick up, and they realized Botan had just launched them through the air.
<font color = white>&#34;Aghh!&#34;</font>
a scream escaped their lips before they crashed head-first into the waiting water, sinking down.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: All of you join him, Suimen is a technique that requires some mannerism of control of Chakra flow.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: You form the Tiger Seal, focus, and even the flow of Chakra towards yer feet to counter-balance the water's movement.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Normally its harder to do this on water then a solid object due to the shifting currents but do not fret.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I have all day to watch you all try, fail, and eventually figure it out.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Don't drown.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: ...what if we don't have the nessecary control?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff5050>Yujin, Kaito  (The brown haired boy-Daniel93325) nods towards the Chuunin, a bit perplexed at the actions of the female chuunin. the brown haired boy would take a deep breath walking forward towards the water. 

<font color = white>&#34;...&#34;</font>

He felt deep down that he was still incapable of learning how to walk on water.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll give it a shot.&#34;</font>

the boy says sarcastically</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) resurfaced and spat the water out of their lungs as they gasped for air and caught Botan's basic explanation.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would go towards the water while wondering if was good idea to do it at all</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Don't drown huh...crazy chuunin...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) itched at the back of his neck as he watched Bill fly through the air towards the water, wincing as he hits the surface with a resounding splash. With a shrug, he stepped forwards towards the water, sending a glance back towards Najiro.
<font color = white>&#34;Then ye&#39;ll sink! Kahahah!&#34;</font>

With that resounding laugh, he threw up the Tiger seal as instructed. Unfortunately, instinct took over. Rather than attempting to step down onto the water&#39;s surface, his shark-like genetics drove him to instead toss himself into the water head-first, his body moving before his brain could stop the motions, and with a splash, he found himself in the water with Bill, remaining submerged as the orange-haired youth dragged himself up to the surface.</font></font></font>

'I'm the only one soaked...great..'
They fumed silently as they kept trying to adjust their chakra, looking for the correct amount, figuring that once did correctly, they would pull themselves to the lake's surface.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would walk right towards the water. With a light step over the edge he steps onto the water. His traditional kimono flowing barely an inch off the surface of the waves. Yes, he was being a show off. He would look on over towards the teacher, then the other's struggling with the technique.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Man... I couldn&#39;t resist just diving in... This time I&#39;ll really try, for real.&#34;</font>

He pulled himself up from the water back to dry land, shaking off his clothing for a moment before throwing the tiger seal up once more, and this time hopping back down towards the water. He remained on the surface for a few moments, before slowly, surely sinking down as if he were standing on custard, rather than a solid surface. 

As he sunk, he gazed towards the Chuunin and shook his head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirked. <font color = white>&#34;Step aside, nimrods!&#34;</font> He said as he confidently scrolled to the side of the edge. Confident as always, he formed the necessary seal and channeled chakra to the soles of his feet. As a last effort to establish his superiority, he looked back at his colleagues. <font color = white>&#34;Watch and learn!&#34;</font> he said before jumping directly to the water.

As he hit the water, his feet slid right out from under him and he went face first into the water. <font color = white>&#34;Gyahh!&#34;</font> he exclaimed as he splashed dramatically. During all this nonsense, both of his shoes slipped off and went sailing above his head. One of them landing on the ground and one in the water, next to Bill. 

As Asa surfaced, his face was noticably red. <font color = white>&#34;Hmph...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) felt themselves slowly rise in the water as their chakra pushed them up, and with a moment of concentration, they would spread the same amount of chakra to their hands as they pulled themself to the surface and stood atop the water with shaky legs.
<font color = white>&#34;I feel like I&#39;m about to fall right back in...&#34;</font>

Taking notes on the instructions given, Afro marched over towards the edge of the water and replicated the same handseals for practice. Once content with his flow, he moved to a second attempt. This time, with a bit more confidence, he'd leap up over the rails with one hand and begin his descent, the sound of his shirt flapping in the wind would come to a stop once as both feet came crashing on the water's surface, generating a strong ripple. 

Just below his feet a school of fish can be seen scattering away from the academy students. Clearly they were disturbing the natural habitate of the area with this assignment.</font></font></font>

One second. Two. Five. Ten. Thirty. Sixty.

He was acclimating to the surface of the water, the feel of the current, and the feel of the Chakra as it padded the soles of his feet. After a whole minute and a half, he heard the Chuunin&#39;s words, and a shark-like grin spread upon his face.

<font color = white>&#34;Now that&#39;s something I&#39;m GOOD at.&#34;</font>

And in no time at all, he disappeared under the water&#39;s surface once more.</font></font></font>

After that, he saw many of his peers managing to follow suit and walk upon the surface of the water themselves. Tenjin then stepped forth.

He lept up into the air while weaving a handseal and focusing his chakra into his feet allowing it to be like an adhesive that made him stick to the surface of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm... &#34;</font> he hummed to himself as he noticed that he was standing on the surface but with too much instability. He needed to get to a point where the ebbing and flowing of the water was not constantly threatening to make him fall over.</font></font></font>

Attempting to maintain his balance, the student would begin walking, slowly advancing up the stream to create some distance between him and his peers.

Once on top of the water, he did his best to stay there. He let go of the wall and carefully walked away from it, slipping slightly as he did so, but remaining balanced. <font color = white>&#34;Hmph!&#34;</font> he said, crossing his arms while comically wobbling back and forth. <font color = white>&#34;Piece of cake, just like I said...

Their gaze shifted to the stern boy as they went face-first into the water, and their gaze followed the boy&#39;s shoes as they flew off their feet.

They will do it without any major issues due to traning somewhat their chakra control,whoever it did drained them somewhat of their chakra to do anything besides walking,if they runned,or even worse attacked,they will simply fall into the water.

Though he wanted to see if perhaps he can increase the timer his chakra did,so he will stay,and check for himself.

Lurking under the murky surface like a predator, he found himself stalking the undercurrents for the fish that the Chuunin had requested.

He was no stranger to the canals of Amegakure, and he was no stranger to the sea life that called the waters around the village home. Plus, he had the natural advantage compared to his peers. While the surface was their domain, the waters belonged to the Hoshigaki, and in time, they surrendered to his will.

He finally re-emerged, holding a writhing, squirming eel in his left hand, and in the right, a fair-sized Yellowtail, of which he dropped down in front of the Chuunin.

A small smile could be noted easing across her face as the edges of her lips slowly crinkled. 

Oh god no! 

   <font color = white>&#34;Here is fine,&#34;</font>

A shift, and suddenly she sent her fist directly into a nearby tree - one that was obviously nearly at the end of its span. A brief creak, and then suddenly it exploded with raw vigor. 

A shower of splintered, and now usable fire-wood was littered around it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Now the fun part,&#34;</font>

Her hand eased back behind her back, and met with the opposite. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Each of you gather a bit of wood, the dry stuff, and some grass,&#34;</font>

She returned to her place.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) as she returned to her place; she was met with a fish flying towards her - in proper fashion she continued to hold her place, and as it eased nearest to her? She extended the same hand used before to turn a tree into firewood, to simply catch it within a claw like fashion. 

A brief SNAP could be noted. It was plopped down admist the others. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Very good, Asa,&#34;</font>

She then put her hands behind her back.</font></font></font>

Also- Yes, Hoshigaki, I know, it&#39;s hard to see me with the water behind me and stuff, but I assure you, I&#39;m ACTUALLY here.&#34;</font>, he spoke addressing the stern boy, the Chuunin and the girl with the enchanted aura in turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Perfect, once the fires are started - would you kindly show them how to prep the fish they have?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It doesn't need to be fancy, a basic grill will do nicely.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded; she moved to draw something from her hip and in turn it was a rather fancy-gilded and ornate dagger. It wasn&#39;t much but it held pupose, and she tossed it over towards the Hoshigaki.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (oops

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (set up a village wide battle, with a score system.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..but i already know that
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) caught the knife - Barely, almost fumbling it and dropping it to the ground before achieving a firm grip. Deciding to work on the biggest fish first, he approached Afro&#39;s large Catfish, before tilting the knife, lining it up with the fish&#39;s eye, and spiking the knife into the fish&#39;s brain, killing it instantly.
<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s better to make sure the fish is dead before you prepare it or it&#39;ll thrash, for big fish it&#39;s easier to either spike it through the eye or to slam it against a rock REALLY REALLY hard.&#34;</font>

From there, he began to prepare the fish, spilling the catfish&#39;s guts as the Jounin approached. He pointed a free hand to Afro, the red-headed individual, while his free hand began to disembowl the fish, tossing the scraps into the water behind him.
<font color = white>&#34;Gotta get the insides out, they&#39;re not good eating. If it&#39;s a lady fish, you might find some roe inside, which is REAL good eats though, so you gotta pay attention. This one doesn&#39;t have any.&#34;</font>

From there, he descaled the fish by scraping the fish&#39;s skin with the blade of the knife, peeling off the hard, inedible scales and leaving the skin below, and once more he tossed the scraps into the water.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, so, we can eat the head too, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of it, so someone else can have that part. Now we gotta light the fire, and make a little contraption to actually cook the fish. We can just prop it up over the fire, or make a little spit for it with some sticks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: So, like. Anyone want to help me build the fire?

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what&#39;s going on over there?&#34;</font>, they thought, looking around for a vantage point where they could see what everyone was circling. They would walk over to a tree near the commotion, their small frame dwarfed by the massive conniferous tree.

With a grunt, they would jump not very far into the air, grasping the tree and slowly beginning their climb up. It would take a few minutes before they found a branch that could hold their weight.

With a small childish squeal, they would grab the sturdy branch and sit upon it dangling their legs as they observed the crowd below.

<font color = white>&#34;WOW! That&#39;s a big fish.&#34;</font>, he said with a child like giggle.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) looked from left to right, and seeing that nobody was willing to help he let out a sigh.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, okay. I&#39;ll do it. Just... Bundle the sticks up like this, put the smaller ones on the bottom because they&#39;ll burn easier, anddd... To grill the fish, we&#39;ll grab these two sticks that kinda look like forks, and just...&#34;</font>

He jammed the two sticks into the ground, grabbing a third stick and impaling the fish from mouth through the back as if it were a spit, before propping it up over the campfire with the two Y-shaped sticks jutting from the ground.

<font color = white>&#34;Now we just need to light the fire, and then we can eat the fish. Usually someone just lights the fire for me, so uh... Help.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is several ways to light up the fire without ninjursu

   <font color = white>&#34;Or,&#34;</font>

She motioned to draw a rather old looking, blunt, and well-used Kunai from the confines of her sleeve. It wasn&#39;t much to look at, but it had a purpose and she was about to show it. 

A moment more and she kicked up a flat rock from the ground before she caught it, and then motioned towards the gathered bundle of sticks before she rolled the rock forward, and then followed with the Kunai. 

A brief strike, and she smeared it across the stone-face before a few sparks flickered forth. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Like so,&#34;</font>

She tossed it over towards the Hoshigaki.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,guess kunais have enough carbon to make sparks.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah...but  if was not that hard it won't worked.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A good bit of Kunai are made with less pure materials, thus it has a higher carbon amount.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) caught the rock, and allowed the Kunai to hit the ground by his foot rather than attempting to catch it to save his fingers, and as instructed he began to strike the rock against the Kunai&#39;s metallic surface. Of course, this began to create sparks, and as he moved the duo of tools closer to the dry scraps at the bottom of the campfire, it began to smolder, burn, and eventually, roar into an open flame, the smell of cooking fish wafting through the air after a few moments as the flame licked against the animal&#39;s flesh.

<font color = white>&#34;Boom! And that&#39;s how you cook a fish! Well- How you START to cook a fish. It&#39;s not cooked yet. This thing&#39;s probably so fresh you could eat it raw without being sick, but it&#39;s better to be safe, I think.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

We may be kids, but we got a lot heart, workin hard for the paper -&#34;</font>, his rap was halted as he jumped wildly as the contractor had yelled at them for not having hard hats.

<font color = white>&#34;Aye, aye, I&#39;ve heard the rest of the clan was out and about, so it made no sense for me to stay put.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

The contractor yelled before he grabbed a <b>LARGE</b> piece of the rubble and effortlessly lifted it. He&#39;d shorlty thenafter hand it to the shark-like kid. 

<font color = white>&#34;Here go put this in the rubble pile.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

NO idea how to fix this, but someone suggested a chimney of some kind, so like... Yeah. Pass me down that hat, would you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would be making his way over with a bundle of sushi and food for all the people working hard on the bridge. He wasn&#39;t particularily physically skilled but he could pitch in to help out those who were busting their asses working at it. With the few little clacks of his sandles he arrived with a very large bundle. He was going to have to make several round trips. He was certainly that this bridge built in part with child labour would entirely hold up. Though he wouldlook over to the hard hats being given out. 
<font color = white>&#34;Do I need to wear one of these even if I am just delivering food to the folks working here?&#34;</font> He calls out having brought plenty of cooled drinks as well. Though it was mostly of the iced tea variety. His eyes went wide at the sight of the Contractor using that Impressive strength to lift up rubble!

Asa kicked a rock into the water, immediately lifting his leg and grabbing his foot <font color = white>&#34;Ow ow ow ow!&#34;</font> Immediately, he regretted his decision of kicking the rock with his shoeless foot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) mosied on over and picked up that pipe with the strength of a man whom has been doing hard labour his whole life.

One hand carried the pipe whilst the other grabbed at his lower back.

<font color = white>&#34;Darn wife wants me to go to the doctor, but we got a deadline to meet.&#34;</font> the man mumbled to himself as he made his way back over towards the edge.

Without much care he began to drop the pipe straight towards the Hoshigaki in the water. Hopefully he was good at catching round, awkward things with sharp edges.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) had just managed to put the hardhat on as the pipe lowered down towards him, and he just managed to avoid the sharp point as it plunged down towards him. He did, however, manage to grab the pipe before it fully submerged. With that, he yelled up to his fellow Hoshigaki.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay! Okay. Great. Good. Yo Cous, wanna come give me a hand with this? We gotta keep the concrete dry with this pipe while we fill these cracks. We can probably leave the pipe in there once we&#39;re done and fill THAT with concrete too. You down?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) breaks into a sweat just thinking about trying to move that much weight themself.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: No worries, you can make multiple trips.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Or take a friend to help.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would make his way on over with the food in his hands. His attention lifts up to hear the other&#39;s talking about the thirty pounds of ice. He would look over to the Cold child. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll help you carry it, the cold doesn&#39;t bother me too much.&#34;</font> He says. Setting down the extra bottles of iced tea he was carrying about to the various workers!</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Over there,and that place too&#34;</font>He will say as they pointed to the places</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded. She seemed to wander over towards Najiro with no true hurry in her movement - as she eased into place? She produced several bolts from behind her back, she was prepared. 

It didn&#39;t take much for her to simply drive them into place with but a flick of her hand, a bit of raw muscle, and they were slammed into home. She repeated such actions as required for each bolt. 

It took only a moment or two. 

   <font color = white>&#34;There we are,&#34;</font>

She returned to her place shortly after.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) was, simply put, waiting for the magic words to be spoken. Asking a half-shark kid to hop into water was akin to asking if a junkie wanted another fix. With a small grin, the boy vaulted over the guard-rail. His body submerging within the body of water beneath the bridge. Awaiting orders and ready to work, he stood - or swam, rather.

       <font color = white>&#34;For sure, beats staying up there, plus, swimming is so much more fun t&#39;me. Jus&#39; tell me what t&#39;do and I got it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) hopped across the bridge and next to the half-shark boy. <font color = white>&#34;Hey there, what&#39;s up!&#34;</font> He said with a slight maniacal glint in his eye. <font color = white>&#34;You guys are doing some good work over here.

<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: Haha just kidding. I'm sure you and your cousin don't eat shoes... Right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Chicken.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) yells: Yeah, just- Just hold the pipe against the crack and make sure the other end is above the water so I can pour in the concre- WE DIDN'T EAT YOUR SHOES, BUDDY!

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm fine with any snack, personally.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oi, oi- Actually, now that I think about it. That fish should be done now. It's just by the big pillar.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (oh rammy.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: You can grab that for everyone, if you want.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and pouts at the words of the dark-skinned dancer. He would slowly walk towards the village, dragging his feet while lifting his kimono as to not sully it.  A visible scowl/pout on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;This is not fun at all...&#34;</font>, he mumbled as he headed deeper into the village, the sound of yelling and footsteps disappearing behind him. After a 10 minute walk, he would arrive on the steps of a large building with a large bright neon sign reading <font color = white>&#34;Ame Convenience&#34;</font>.

A sigh escapes his lips, as he enters and begins collecting packages of water. He would make multiple trips from the isles to the counter as he stacked 3 cases of water onto the counter.

A trickle of sweat would slide down his small brow, as he wiped it away with his sleeve. He would then head towards the back of the store and begin grabbing bags of ice. They were surprisingly less hefty than he had expected. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, do you happen to have something I can carry all this in? They wanted me to make multiple trips but I dont think that is going to work. It will take forever.&#34;</font>, he politely asked the shopkeep. He would explain his work at the bridge and how he had been assisting with rebuilding the destroyed bridge.

After a long discussion, they would be directed to the shops horse and buggy which he would loan the child only due to it being a mission to assist the village. After paying for the supplies, the small child would load all of his material into the horse and buggy, getting into the carriage and grabbing the reigns. 

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you, sir!&#34;</font>, he said, before quickly having the reigns snatched by the shopkeep who also entered the buggy. Apparently letting a 10 year old disappear with his only method of transporting his stock was too much to ask.

With a pout the two would slowly head back towards the bridge, the large stockpile of water and ice bouning in the carriage. As they approached all of the busy works scurrying around the bridge, they would wave. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: He just arrived.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) followed the Black haired males lead and began helping point out the bolts that needed to be drilled intot he rail. He creates a half-ram seal activating his Dojutsu to get a better view and get the spots the Black haired male could not see.

<font color = white>&#34;Byakugan....There are more over there Lady! Further down from where you bolted the others.&#34;</font> he said pointing down to where they were. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: YOU ALL GET THREE MINUTES TO HAVE A DRINK AND A SNACK BEFORE WE RESUME.
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) yells: WE HAVE A DEADLINE TO MAKE!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The work in progress-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..A deadline?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: Awww man Three minutes???
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) yells: THIS BRIDGE ISN'T GOING TO REPAIR ITSELF!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) Would have left to assist the cold boy with his moving of the water and ice. All things considered they would haul it on along. Pushing it back and forth to the best of their ability. Though he would move from the other to Foreman Kreig. His hands lugging the two large jugs of iced tea on over to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Here you are sir.&#34;</font> His arms was shaking eeever so faintly. He was ill suited to physical work!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded; she eased back over once more - and this time towards the Hyuuga that had pointed out the locations. She took it upon herself to quickly jostle a series of bolts into place much like before - a few brief flicks of her wrist, and she slammed several of them home. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Very well,&#34;</font>

She chuckled, and eased back over towards her spot once more. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: YOU! GET A TROWEL AND START SMOOTHING OUT THE CONCRETE THEY JUST POURED ON THE SUPPORT BEAM.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sir..thats violation of the work code.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: A break should be fifteen minutes.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The work in progress-DragonQuestVIII) narrowed her eyes in a stint of confusion. Having only just arrived, the sudden gathering of blue-collared &#39;workers&#39; caught the girl by surprise. It didn&#39;t help that someone had already taken time to outright demand something of her.

     <font color = white>&#34;Is this some new way of asking for help..?&#34;</font>

She murmurs, her eyes trailing from the loud contractor to the crowd of youth.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) did as instructed by his older cousin, keeping a firm grip on the pipe. Whilst being utterly clueless in the eyes of stuff like this - Jinbeisame caught on quite quickly. The boy's grip tightening around the pipe as the concrete was soon to be poured. Or at least it was until the mention of a <b>THREE. MINUTE. BREAK</b>. Was this the life of the men behind the repairs of the village? A simple three-minute break? A silent prayer was made that he never failed as a Shinobi and would have to submit to <i>this</i> layer of work.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: well..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can certanly hear a new arrival..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) nodded to the girl as he made his way over to the cart and grasped a trowel before bringing it to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;Yes, we have to make deadline. You&#39;ll be compensated for your efforts. I just need you to make it smooth before it dries.&#34;</font> he continued on towards the center of the bridge where concrete had just been poured into the support and more of the genin were starting to work on the railing.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;re making good progress! I need a couple of you to start working on the surface now that all of the rubble is remove. Mix some more concret and grab some trowels from the cart. Always remember that less is more!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) began to pour the concrete into the pipe held firm by his younger cousin, motioning him to tilt the pipe further and further as the pipe itself began to fill with concrete. This, was the best way to go about fixing such a crack - Otherwise, the concrete would become damaged by the water, and due to the sharp point of the pipe, it would be easy enough to lodge it in the ground, creating a solid pillar of concrete within the crack itself to maintain structure. The surface level could be fixed traditionally, but underwater, the concrete would become waterlogged. Thankfully, two shark-men are better than one.

<font color = white>&#34;Eh, break? Three minutes...? We&#39;re not exactly doing anything strainworthy here just yet, we can just save our three minutes and take a six-minute break later. Keheheheh!&#34;</font>, he barked out, as he eventually filled the pipe with concrete. 
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, now just put it flush into the crack, lean it all the way vertical so the point is digging into the ground at the bottom, and we can fill the top part. This thing&#39;s just a solid concrete-steel pole at this point, it&#39;ll keep this strut held good.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Like this?&#34;</font>

A quick hand pushed down upon it; clearly far too hard. Rather than make the material smooth, she actually left a rather large indent within it.</font></font></font>

With this leverage Kreig effortlessly lifted the boy from the ground and held him over the ledge of the bridge.

He would scan the workers around the area attempting to gain knoweldge on how he should be performing his work. After a few moment, he would follow the contractors example.

He would smile as the contractor marched over the stern boy and lift him off the ground holding him over the edge of the bridge.

With that the construction worker simultaneously released his grip on the boy&#39;s shirt and took a firm grasp of his pants. Giving him the most gnarly wedgie imaginable.

Yet again, the mirror&#39;s the man&#39;s words. Her hands move once more, a standard attempt at imitating what he had displayed for her. She presses softer into the ground this time with the tool. There doesn&#39;t come a hard bit of damage like before... but the area certainly isn&#39;t the smoothest to anyone with a good eye.

For an amateur, it was all one could really expect.

     <font color = white>&#34;I guess.. As long as this thing pays.&#34;</font>

Wriggling and desperately attempting to free himself from the contractor&#39;s hold on his undies, he said <font color = white>&#34;Fine! Fine! Just let go!&#34;</font> and with a whimper, finished with, <font color = white>&#34;This is child abuse...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Now shadowing the actions of his relative. 
                 <font color = white>&#34;Like this, right? Or am I being to loose along the steel pipe..?&#34;</font>, he spoke, his words coming off as a new employee seeking affirmation.

The actions of what went on above his head caught little of his attention. Though the audible noise of a kids underwear <i>ripping</i> caught his attention for a short while. A cringed expression spreading across his face but you know..

He would slowly turn and begin mimicking the actions of others around him with the trowel while continuing to watch the scene unfold.</font></font></font>

The contractor looked back to the new arrival. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s much better. Just be sure to keep it even. The stuff pretty much levels itself so slow is fast.&#34;</font>

The man then went over to examine the shark&#39;s work. <font color = white>&#34;Lookin&#39; good shark boys. I&#39;ll have you two come up and here and get ready to pour the new surface for the bridge as soon as wedgie boy here finishes the forms.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
