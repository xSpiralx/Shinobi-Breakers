<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) unwraps his belt from around his middle. His robes stayed tightly around his body, perhaps something else was holding it in place.

The belt was deceivingly long, the students around him would notice. He held on to one end of the fabric while he tossed the other end forward towards Sogeki, the material seemingly stretching as it headed towards it's target.

The belt would begin to wrap around Sogeki, tightening in a second and restraining all movements but speech.

He would release the bind before it became permanent the following turn.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Matsu, the Hyuuga martial artist, unwrapped his deceptive belt from around his waist, Sogeki observed with a keen, calculating gaze. The fabric seemed unnaturally long, hinting at hidden abilities or techniques beyond its mundane appearance. Sogeki remained outwardly composed, though his mind analyzed the unfolding situation with meticulous detail.

As Matsu tossed one end of the belt towards him, Sogeki noted the fluid motion and the controlled extension of the fabric. The belt surged forward, the material stretching unnaturally as it closed the distance between them with surprising speed.

The fabric wrapped around Sogeki swiftly, tightening with a suddenness that restricted his movements but allowed him to speak. He felt the constricting pressure against his body, a calculated move by Matsu to assert control and limit his freedom momentarily.

Maintaining his calm demeanor, Sogeki subtly wiped his palm against his vest, smearing a thin layer of sweat from his skin onto the fabric. It was a small, tactical move—preparing himself mentally and physically for any further developments in the encounter.

While outwardly restrained, Sogeki's focus remained sharp and unwavering. His eagle-like vision scanned the surrounding area, assessing the reactions of the students and bystanders. He remained alert for any sign of aggression or opportunistic movement, his mind calculating potential threats and strategies with cool precision.

Despite the temporary restraint, Sogeki's eyes conveyed a silent warning to those around him—a reminder of his readiness to respond swiftly and decisively to any challenge. His posture remained relaxed yet poised, a testament to his training and experience as a shinobi who thrived in moments of controlled chaos.

As Matsu prepared to release the binding, Sogeki awaited the moment with a measured patience, ready to assess the situation and determine his next course of action. The encounter had tested his resolve and adaptability, reinforcing his reputation as a shinobi who navigated challenges with calculated precision and unwavering focus.</font></font></font>

However, instead of an open palm, he curled his fingers forwards resembling a grasping motion.

To those looking at his hand, they would see each finger glow a menacingly purple color in turn - starting with the pinky. In a swift strike, he would slam the fingers into the Hoshigaki's middle.

The blow did not seem to hurt the boy, he could feel something was OFF about him.</font></font></font>

However...

It barely moved the Hoshigaki, simply inching them back half a stepas the shark blinked in confusion. They peered down at their body from under that large straw hat, then back up at the Hyuuga, then back down, and back up once more.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m... Not entirely sure what that did, but it did <b>something</b>.&#34;</font>, they remarked, moving their arms, their legs, rolling their neck - Something was off, but they couldn&#39;t quite figure out what just yet.

<font color = white>&#34;... Nothing&#39;s happening. I&#39;m <b>positive</b> I weaved them correctly... It&#39;s...&#34;</font>

Their brow furrowed for a moment, before widening in shock.

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Who's lookin' for a fight?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Is all you people do is fight?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: No. I train too.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: "is all you do" is sit on your ass?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) turns their head to look in Sogeki's direction, their eyes looking the older child over. He would sigh before pulling his eye down and sticking his tongue out at the older child.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) couldn&#39;t care less about the nerds reaction to the truth-- as long as the truth was spoken. Sogeki pockets both hands and shifts his gaze from person to person as they approached him.

In the back of the Satetsu mind, the thought of the hunt still lingers. He pays close attention, refusing to allow anyone that isn&#39;t on the list too close.
   <font color = white>&#34;..mmm,&#34;</font> He grumbles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: You know I thought village mates were suppose to be..I dont know..Nicer to each other.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: All people do around here is beat each other up.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: That is the best way to be nice to one another. We train, spar and grow with one another.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: We learn each other habits.. then we dominate and eliminate any and all krakens.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Sadly.. you're starting to sound like a kraken yourself.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Kraken?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: What is a kraken?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) <font color = white>&#34;..you,&#34;</font> Sogeki states coldly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its his way to say you enemyy
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: It sounds like a compliment
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Why can't there be any normal kids in this village.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Everyone's all edgy and weird.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Although being a kraken sounds kind of cool.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Not about being edgy. At least I don't consider myself that. I just don't like people that sit around and act like we're not more than just kids playing ninja.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: We are literally around the corner from graduation.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Get off your butt.. and I don't know.. train?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Who says I havent been training?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Y'all act like this is some slice of life manga..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: You just met me.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I just don't train ALL the time, jerk.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: So
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: You're complaining about us wanting to fight. So that implies that, even if you do train, it's the bare minimum. You're judging us for doing what we wish to do.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Najiro I heard you were having a duel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Part of being a ninja is knowing your friends, as more than just fighting machines.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: What better way to bond that battle and converse?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: You act like conversations dont happen prior, during, and post spar.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How about starting with a conversation? The first thing you said was let's fight.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not going to explain basic manners to a meat head.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: So you're angry about my conversation starter?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I do
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Angry? No, not really.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Cause we're conversing now. Are you satisfied enough to fight me?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Nothing to be angry about.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Have you decided yet?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: Then what is your issue?
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: I already know who they have
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will fight you in one weeks time.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm working on a new technique.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Right now, you'd probably beat me, so it's a waste of both of our time.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I'm simply trying to understand your logic. Throwing hands isn't necessary. But I accept the challenge.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: Najiro i'll fight on your side if you'll have me
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: You said that all we do is fight, I say that fighting is our way to bond. Then you said we don't even converse prior to battle, I said we converse before, during, and after.. So what exactly is your issue with folks that actually like to hone their skills through consistent sparring?
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: If you're not doing it, don't expect others
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: That's why people have teams
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I as well, Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: If we go into battle, its a stronger motivator to know and care for the person beside you.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm...sure Chizu.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Najiro do you need throwing weapons at all?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I don't know your hopes, your dreams, or aspirations. I barely know your name, yet we expect to operate as cohesive units when we face our enemies.
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) increases their health by Full - 6 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And i do need.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: and...shurikens
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Are you in a clan?

<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: If you are, ask your clan
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: ....There aren't that many of my clan left...
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: Oh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) softens his glare as he and the cold child kept their gazes locked.
  <font color = white>&#34;..truthfully, you have a point. A lot of the issues you just brought up is tackled in sparring. The connection, the trust, the laughs, the shame, the pride, the motivation-- all of it. All of it is established during sparring-- whether you want to believe it or not.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not in clan.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9a364d>Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) divides and hands the cold child a small pouch of senbon as well</font></font></font>

He was enjoying the shade.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Sageki pooh are you still being hunted down?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Depends.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Will you buy me shoes?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I'll only allow rich, cute girls to get close. Anyone else will have to fight me.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Sure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) turns their gaze back to the individual across the park. Their small child-like eyes locking onto Sogeki&#39;s. Their words were not meant as insults but rather a lesson. A lesson that his clan had been taught in blood and destruction.

<font color = white>&#34;I..I just don&#39;t want to see any of you die because we focused so much on fighting that we forget we are people. My clan were amazing warriors, yet they failed to understand that building bonds is what makes a unit strong...And so we were nearly wiped off of the planet.&#34;</font>, he said solemnly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: Sogeki, I didn't know you had this side to you, interesting.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: So-Sogeki poo? Eww gross!

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: We don't need more shinobi marrying into clans.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Sometimes it's nice to have smart people around.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sits on the ground and crosses their legs, laughing and holding their stomach with a child-like innocence that was rare in a shinobi.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) turns to the Yuki.
  <font color = white>&#34;What your clan went through is understandable. Your sentiments are understandable as well. I can not blame you for prioritizing the things you do.. But allow us to bond the way we like, and you bond the way you like. That doesn&#39;t mean our two worlds can&#39;t coexist..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The blonde woman

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) rolls over in the grass. All this yapping in the backgrouind was ruining his beauty sleep.</font></font></font>

Bracing his abs, and lowering his body as far as he can by pushing his hips back and bending his knees. Pausing and then pushing himself back into the starting position. That was only one repetition. Now it was time to do many more until failure!</font></font></font>

A brief twist of movement could be noted; and she vanished into a blinding blur of immense speed and raw agility. She appeared directly before him, and looked down towards him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You do, yes,&#34;</font>

A fist was launched directly towards his stomach - she didn&#39;t care about the back-talk but this man has ushered forth something previously, and she had to repay the kind for what he had done. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You threw a rock at my cat,&#34;</font>

She then drew her fist back, and simply moved to let him fall accordingly.

Without hesitation he reacts by headbutt=ing his head in to the fist to take on even greater force of the strike.
(Damage Cap raised to Critical)

Sending himself flying back off the contact and then splashing in to the water. A familiar sensation. Though last time he enjoyed flying higher in the air. For a moment he was under the water and eventually surfaced.

His pair of shirts was missing and he lacked shoes. Quite literally punched right out of his clothing.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh. The PAIN!&#34;</font>
Gripping his chest as many tears began to shed. Now floating on top of the water as he swayed around at its will.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font>

He would then simply jump into the water, swimming over to the injured boy and grabbing him by his underarms, then proceeding to use a half back stroke to swim back to the edge of the water and pull both himself and the boy out of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp... Anybody wanna take him to the hospital?&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t seem too thrilled on the aspect of transporting blast to the hospital so he hoped somebody else could do it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was holding on to a thread of his consciousness.
<font color = white>&#34;A hospital?&#34;</font>
His tone made it seem like he was against it. Unwilling to go to such an establishment. Was there a bigger reason behind it.

<font color = white>&#34;They&#39;ll put me further in to the system. Can&#39;t have that.&#34;</font>
Grabbing hold of that thread a bit tighter and forcing himself to withstand the crucial pain from the recent assault.

Looking to the one known as...Tatsu? Maybe. He cared little for any names. They were still students and it wasn&#39;t like he shared life or death with them in the field of unknown battle outside of their home.
<font color = white>&#34;You are a good guy. Stay that way.&#34;</font>
Giving him a thumbs up along with a smile that went with it.

<font color = white>&#34;Well... Okay then, no problem.&#34;</font>

He would return the thumbs up and then look around for the boy&#39;s clothes which may have ended up being washed away in the water.

<font color = white>&#34;You might wanna put some clothes on though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

It was clear that if someone wished to convey their words, then they would either need to shout or talk fro REALLY close.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Seems like it might be too early for questions.. I&#39;ll come back later. Be a darling Sha-chan, and ask your young friends if they would be interested in the prospect of purchasing designer clothes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
