<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: D'we have any teachers in Taijutsu or Kenjutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: Could i not learn under you if i promise to not use your teachings until then?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Nope!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Don't think so, Beisame, which is really annoying..

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) says: Oh. Oi, Cuz.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) unwraps his belt from around his middle. His robes stayed tightly around his body, perhaps something else was holding it in place.

The belt was deceivingly long, the students around him would notice. He held on to one end of the fabric while he tossed the other end forward towards Sogeki, the material seemingly stretching as it headed towards it's target.

The belt would begin to wrap around Sogeki, tightening in a second and restraining all movements but speech.

He would release the bind before it became permanent the following turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Hana was looking for you, you speak to her yet or nah?
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: Yee', I'mma help her fight Naji
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: (Naji' in two weeks.*
<br><font color=red>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) just reduced their chakra by a cost of E - 2 / 3
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Good, good. Kick his ass good for me, that dude is annoying as hell. Rude to me all the time. I've already told Hana I'd pay her a hundred if he comes out of that fight with a hospital-worthy injury.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers: Y'don't have to worry 'bout that. Me 'nd Hana are probably the strongest students, strength wise.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Yeah, I got faith in you both. I just wanna see that uppity little dick get his ass kicked.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Thinks he's better than everyone, tch...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Matsu, the Hyuuga martial artist, unwrapped his deceptive belt from around his waist, Sogeki observed with a keen, calculating gaze. The fabric seemed unnaturally long, hinting at hidden abilities or techniques beyond its mundane appearance. Sogeki remained outwardly composed, though his mind analyzed the unfolding situation with meticulous detail.

As Matsu tossed one end of the belt towards him, Sogeki noted the fluid motion and the controlled extension of the fabric. The belt surged forward, the material stretching unnaturally as it closed the distance between them with surprising speed.

The fabric wrapped around Sogeki swiftly, tightening with a suddenness that restricted his movements but allowed him to speak. He felt the constricting pressure against his body, a calculated move by Matsu to assert control and limit his freedom momentarily.

Maintaining his calm demeanor, Sogeki subtly wiped his palm against his vest, smearing a thin layer of sweat from his skin onto the fabric. It was a small, tactical move—preparing himself mentally and physically for any further developments in the encounter.

While outwardly restrained, Sogeki's focus remained sharp and unwavering. His eagle-like vision scanned the surrounding area, assessing the reactions of the students and bystanders. He remained alert for any sign of aggression or opportunistic movement, his mind calculating potential threats and strategies with cool precision.

Despite the temporary restraint, Sogeki's eyes conveyed a silent warning to those around him—a reminder of his readiness to respond swiftly and decisively to any challenge. His posture remained relaxed yet poised, a testament to his training and experience as a shinobi who thrived in moments of controlled chaos.

As Matsu prepared to release the binding, Sogeki awaited the moment with a measured patience, ready to assess the situation and determine his next course of action. The encounter had tested his resolve and adaptability, reinforcing his reputation as a shinobi who navigated challenges with calculated precision and unwavering focus.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) walked up to the volunteer and adopted a fighting stance. He looked ready to deliver the Hyuuga's famous open palm blows. He pulled his right back back at the hip level, building momentum. However, instead of an open palm, he curled his fingers forwards resembling a grasping motion.

To those looking at his hand, they would see each finger glow a menacingly purple color in turn - starting with the pinky. In a swift strike, he would slam the fingers into the Hoshigaki's middle.

The blow did not seem to hurt the boy, he could feel something was OFF about him.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) stood statue-still as the Hyuuga approached, though as the Jounin shifted into a combative stance they instinctively tensed up, reacting to absorb the brunt of whatever blow was to strike upon their form. However...

It barely moved the Hoshigaki, simply inching them back half a stepas the shark blinked in confusion. They peered down at their body from under that large straw hat, then back up at the Hyuuga, then back down, and back up once more.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m... Not entirely sure what that did, but it did <b>something</b>.&#34;</font>, they remarked, moving their arms, their legs, rolling their neck - Something was off, but they couldn&#39;t quite figure out what just yet. Perhaps if they were better-trained, they would be able to figure it out, but for now... Just confusion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) watched as each of the Jounin's fingers glowed with visible chakra, and their breath hitched.
The amount of chakra needed to make it visible was massive, so seeing such a feat in person was incredible and served to cement the jounin's power in their mind.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: What's it do?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ..I think that's the same technique he tried to use on me.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I got up outta there immediately..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Try using a technique!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) wasn&#39;t familiar with the ender man and lend closer towards Bill and nudge him with his elbow just to ask for the figures name. <font color = white>&#34;Who is that?&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) offered a sharp nod, throwing their hands together in a rather slow weaving of seals, intending to utilize the Bunshin technique. However...

<font color = white>&#34;... Nothing&#39;s happening. I&#39;m <b>positive</b> I weaved them correctly... It&#39;s...&#34;</font>

Their brow furrowed for a moment, before widening in shock.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s like I can&#39;t... Mold my chakra. Something&#39;s like... I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just different.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I'll remove the seal in a few hours!

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: In a few hours is wild. You screwed that man knowing he is being hunted.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: When I remember to remove it I suppose....
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..You ask him to volunteer then you shut off his chakra for hours?

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Nope.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) says: But I VOLUNTEERED to demonstrate this for you! And now you're leaving me like this for a few HOURS?! I need chakra to BREATHE.

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: But Saigo, my friend.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) let out a sigh of relief as their chakra paths were unsealed, rubbing at the bridge of their nose for a moment before handing over fifty Ryo to the Jounin.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (it's only 7 points, it gives you +3 inventory slots, and you can throw two tools per round instead of one

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (Even if you're not a shurriken build, you always want to spend resources to win, and shurriken throwing is a damage resource)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (though tbh you could spend 9 points and get +6 instead of +3
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (but that's on you

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: You're complaining about us wanting to fight. So that implies that, even if you do train, it's the bare minimum. You're judging us for doing what we wish to do.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) asks: Najiro I heard you were having a duel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Part of being a ninja is knowing your friends, as more than just fighting machines.

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: You act like conversations dont happen prior, during, and post spar.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not going to explain basic manners to a meat head.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will fight you in one weeks time.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm working on a new technique.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Right now, you'd probably beat me, so it's a waste of both of our time.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I'm simply trying to understand your logic. Throwing hands isn't necessary. But I accept the challenge.
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: Najiro i'll fight on your side if you'll have me
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: You said that all we do is fight, I say that fighting is our way to bond. Then you said we don't even converse prior to battle, I said we converse before, during, and after.. So what exactly is your issue with folks that actually like to hone their skills through consistent sparring?
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: If you're not doing it, don't expect others
<br><font color=green>*Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) says: That's why people have teams
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: I as well, Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: If we go into battle, its a stronger motivator to know and care for the person beside you.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm...sure Chizu.

A fist was launched directly towards his stomach - she didn&#39;t care about the back-talk but this man has ushered forth something previously, and she had to repay the kind for what he had done. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You threw a rock at my cat,&#34;</font>

She then drew her fist back, and simply moved to let him fall accordingly.

Without hesitation he reacts by headbutt=ing his head in to the fist to take on even greater force of the strike.
(Damage Cap raised to Critical)

Sending himself flying back off the contact and then splashing in to the water. A familiar sensation. Though last time he enjoyed flying higher in the air. For a moment he was under the water and eventually surfaced.

His pair of shirts was missing and he lacked shoes. Quite literally punched right out of his clothing.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh. The PAIN!&#34;</font>
Gripping his chest as many tears began to shed. Now floating on top of the water as he swayed around at its will.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font>

He would then simply jump into the water, swimming over to the injured boy and grabbing him by his underarms, then proceeding to use a half back stroke to swim back to the edge of the water and pull both himself and the boy out of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp... Anybody wanna take him to the hospital?&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t seem too thrilled on the aspect of transporting blast to the hospital so he hoped somebody else could do it.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;A hospital?&#34;</font>
His tone made it seem like he was against it. Unwilling to go to such an establishment. Was there a bigger reason behind it.

<font color = white>&#34;They&#39;ll put me further in to the system. Can&#39;t have that.&#34;</font>
Grabbing hold of that thread a bit tighter and forcing himself to withstand the crucial pain from the recent assault.

Looking to the one known as...Tatsu? Maybe. He cared little for any names. They were still students and it wasn&#39;t like he shared life or death with them in the field of unknown battle outside of their home.
<font color = white>&#34;You are a good guy. Stay that way.&#34;</font>
Giving him a thumbs up along with a smile that went with it.

<font color = white>&#34;Well... Okay then, no problem.&#34;</font>

He would return the thumbs up and then look around for the boy&#39;s clothes which may have ended up being washed away in the water.

<font color = white>&#34;You might wanna put some clothes on though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

He might have been bleeding from his head, but he didn&#39;t care - he two girls one for each arm, and was obviously talking up his game. Those feet moved with /swag/ as the kids called it. 

He was hip. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Yo, you two wann- oh FUCK SHE SENT PEOPLE,&#34;</font>

He seemed to toss the two women to the side; and thus they were laid out into the ground albeit uninjured one seemed to coo in joy. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Oh! So manly!,&#34;</font>

He grumbled, and replied.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) had arrived towards the bridge alongside his squadron. The white irises of the half-shark inspecting the man. Not as if to inspect him for anything, simply to get a good look on who was causing such ruckus.

Whilst it could be admitted that he <b>was indeed cool looking..</b> and carried a aura of <b>swagger</b>. A job was a job, and hence, a order is an order. 

Though, the mentioning of the word &#39;pest&#39; flew over his head. Having already heard a many of slights due to his half-shark appearnce, it didnt phase him much.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) twitched; he had gotten heated yet once the boy spoke up? He smirked, and chuckled with a thunderous laughter.

   <font color = white>&#34;Finally! Someone with some fashion!,&#34;</font>

That smirk creaked, and if his face wasn&#39;t normal? It would slide right past the boundaries of reality, and bend it to his whims. It AURA was that potent; and slowly he eased a half-step back. 

A single foot in front of the other, and he curved his knee slightly. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Wait, you think I&#39;m weak?! I&#39;m Ito of the Takeshi Family! I run this shit, I&#39;m the boss, the don, and all that comes with it - you could even call me the Chairma-,&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I think we have to just get down to business yeah?&#34;</font>

He chose to ignore the weird looking man for now, he was already annoying him.

<font color = white>&#34;All we have to do is take care of him...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) It appeared the time for combat had come. The latch atop his poncho was undid swiftly. The poncho itself being cast aside as his own stylish blue threads were showcased in full. 

Hitting the pose akin of Hikari, the boy would enter a stance. A stance ready for any and everything that could be thrown at him.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mon then, from one fashion icon to another, I won&#39;t damage yer threads <i>too</i> much..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) had already formed his stance; it was an oddity akin to more of a weird disco-posture as compared to actual combat but alas it was his style, don&#39;t judge, and be rude to the idiot. 

A grumble formed, and suddenly a a shimmering hilt of metal could be spotted coiled to his hip as he rolled his hand down admist a hilt so that he could draw what appeared to be a Katana!

Oh shit! It was actually more or less a generic-looking, and mass produced replica but alas to those Students? It looked like the greatest thing ever made, a shimmering tone of steel - gems, jewels, and a badass looking shark-skin felted tassel. 

This thing was cool. 

   <font color = white>&#34;WAHHHHHH-HA!,&#34;</font>

He quickly rushed forward - the battle had begun, a battle of immense and god-like strength would quickly unfol...wait a fucking minute?! A sudden THUD could be noted, and the man found himself quickly face-planted into the freshly paved bridge. 

Grumble...grumble. 

   <font color = white>&#34;..Gre-?,&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) would watch as the man would pull out what seemed to be a sword to him, he couldn&#39;t really tell the difference between a replica and an actual sword because he hadn&#39;t really trained with swords. He pulled back into a low stance awaiting the man&#39;s approach but would be surprised when he would trip and fall on hs face.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow... That&#39;s unorthodox...&#34;</font>

He wouldn&#39;t approach the prone man, waiting for him to either get back up or for it to be revealed that he had knocked himself unconscious.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice. His face showcasing nothing but utter confusion.

     <font color = white>&#34;<b>B.. Bro.. Get up, this is embarassing..</b>&#34;</font>

Then his eyes shifted over towards the katana and it&#39;s scabbard. Whilst it was not expressively said just yet - he definitely called dibs on such an item. A katana, a zanbatou, it did not matter. If any item could be attained..

<b><i>He had to attain it.</b></i>

When he noticed the man tripping he took an opportunity, throwing the shurikens towards the man as he stood, to where they&#39;d all land simultaneously.

He would duck down to narrowly avoid the sword from cutting his head off. Immediately he would realise that standing in a line like this was not a good idea. He would rush forward and approach the man from behind.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay... Not as much of a chump as a I thought.&#34;</font>

He would then continue to send a simple kick to the back of the man&#39;s knees in an attempt to get him off balance.

With barely enough time to simply <i>raise his defenses</i>. With his face shifting into one of pure grit and determination, his hands pressed onto the floor after his block - sending his body forwards as he allies hit him from the sides.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m takin&#39; that blade from ya&#39;, one way, <b><i>OR ANOTHER..!&#34;</font>, he spoke as he sprung himself forward.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9a364d>Chizu (The street rat-Karlach) gripped the tanto in his right hand tight as he braced for the swing coming towards him. Jumping back just in time, the sweep of the blade would narrowly miss cutting him open.

He would glare, taking three more shuriken from his scarf.

Once again, Chizu would throw the shurikens towards the ragged man, the three shriken zooming in towards the pompadour man.

He was starting to get himself into an adjustment; and as they all motioned to surround him and thus engage him once more? He was ready; a brief flash of movement, and he twisted about nearing a half-step leap upwards. 

Those blows creaked along below him. Those arms attempting to grasp him, and those Shuriken seemly curved along. They were about to crash into each other, and that simply aided him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Oh?! Its time to put my back into it!,&#34;</font>

A shift of his body; he was floating albeit briefly - the world coaxed into a near halt, and suddenly he dropped his arm forth and the length of steel seemed to coax along the air. 

A brief eruption of sparks fluttering into view, and suddenly an explosion of intense HEAT! OH MY WHAT WAS THIS?! He was starting to glow; an AURA began to flare up. He had begun to build up his HEAT BAR!

   <font color = white>&#34;OHHHHH YAH! ITO STYLE SUPER INTENSE FLAME CUT!,&#34;</font>

That heat erupted into a brief X along the ground, and then BOOM! He landed nearby.
