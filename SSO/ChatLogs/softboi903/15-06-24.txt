<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) As Daigen made his way through the training grounds, he noticed a small, tranquil body of water nearby. The surface was still, reflecting the cloudy sky and the surrounding trees with mirror-like clarity. Drawn to the calmness of the scene, he walked over and stood at the water&#39;s edge, gazing at his own reflection.

For a moment, he stared into his own eyes, seeing the determination and resolve that had driven him through countless hours of training. The reflection seemed to challenge him, a reminder of the strength he was striving to achieve.

<font color = white>&#34;Time to push myself even further,&#34;</font> he murmured to himself.

Taking a deep breath, Daigen stepped back from the water&#39;s edge and assumed a fighting stance. He began to practice shadow sparring, imagining an opponent in front of him. His movements were precise and fluid, each punch and kick executed with perfect form.

He moved swiftly, his fists slicing through the air as he threw a series of rapid punches. His legs followed with powerful kicks, each one controlled and focused. The reflection in the water provided a silent audience, mirroring his every move.

Daigen shifted his stance, incorporating dodges and counterattacks into his routine. He visualized his imaginary opponent&#39;s moves, reacting with speed and agility. His body moved instinctively, the countless hours of training evident in his fluid motions.

As he sparred, Daigen&#39;s mind focused entirely on his movements. The world around him seemed to fade away, leaving only the sound of his breath and the rhythm of his attacks. He pushed himself harder, his strikes becoming more intense and powerful.

Occasionally, he glanced at his reflection, using it as a guide to correct his form and technique. The still water provided a unique perspective, allowing him to see his own movements from a different angle. He adjusted his stance and strikes, ensuring each one was as effective as possible.

Minutes turned into an hour as Daigen continued his shadow sparring. Sweat began to bead on his forehead, but he paid it no mind, his focus unwavering. He practiced a variety of techniques, from basic punches and kicks to more complex combinations and maneuvers.

Finally, after an intense session, Daigen paused to catch his breath. He stood at the water&#39;s edge once more, his reflection now showing a shinobi who had pushed himself to the limit. The calmness of the scene contrasted sharply with the intensity of his training, creating a sense of balance and harmony.

<font color = white>&#34;One step at a time,&#34;</font> he repeated to himself, feeling a renewed sense of determination.

With a final nod to his reflection, Daigen turned away from the water and began to walk back towards the training grounds. He felt a deep sense of accomplishment, knowing that he had taken another important step on his journey to becoming one of the strongest shinobi Amegakure had ever seen.</font></font></font>

He hadn't taken him for the type to ask for mentorship. In what he'd briefly seen of him he seemed closer to a brute of some kind. His head slowly tilts to the side as his eyes trail along the woman's movements.

In one swift motion she watches the woman attempt to throw them into the waters and in this he looks toward the newcomer on his right.

He would raise his hands up and push away anything she would try to offer him.

While his classmates indulged in various extracurricular activities, he remained singularly dedicated to forging a path towards a stronger future. The petty distractions of others held no sway over his ambitions or principles.

His determination to establish a solid foundation for himself was palpable, driving him to hone his skills relentlessly. Whether in combat training or mastering advanced techniques, Sogeki pushed himself with unwavering discipline. The fleeting pursuits and diversions of his peers were inconsequential in his pursuit of mastery and excellence.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me,&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the ambient noise, his tone laced with arrogance and confidence as he turned to the dark-skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;How does one earn the honor of becoming your first and most important pupil?&#34;</font> His gaze locked onto hers, challenging and expectant, as if daring her to recognize his potential and skill.</font></font></font>

She didn&#39;t even make notice of the young lad drowning - he would learn to swim, or he would sink. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? My methods are harsh, brutal, and often end the lives of those wishing to learn to become like me if they survive? Often more then not they are crippled. Train, and show me that you can survive - then we can see,&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) When the soft spoken lass leaped in to the water, they&#39;d see the white-haired boy with his legs and arms crossed relaxing in the water. As if taking a break before decided to resurface.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) 
As Daigen left the tranquil training area and walked towards the busier parts of Amegakure, he soon found himself in a crowded marketplace. The vibrant energy of the village was palpable, with merchants calling out their wares, villagers chatting animatedly, and children running about. The contrast to the solitude of his training ground was stark, but Daigen moved through the crowd with ease, his senses alert and focused.

His attention was drawn to a dark-skinned woman standing in the center of the bustling crowd. She had an air of confidence and charisma that seemed to captivate those around her. The crowd’s attention was firmly fixed on her, and she spoke with a commanding presence that demanded respect.

Daigen didn't approach her directly. Instead, he found a spot nearby where he could observe without drawing too much attention to himself. Leaning against a wall, he watched as the woman engaged with the people around her. She spoke passionately about something, her gestures animated and expressive. 

He tried to discern what she was saying from a distance. Her voice, though clear, was drowned out by the general noise of the market. However, her body language and the reactions of the crowd spoke volumes. She appeared to be a figure of some importance or influence, and the villagers seemed to hang on her every word.

Daigen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he observed. He noted the way she commanded the space around her, the way people leaned in to listen, the respect evident in their expressions. There was something about her that intrigued him, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. 

His thoughts wandered as he considered the possibilities. Who was this woman? What role did she play in the village? Was she a shinobi, a leader, or perhaps someone with a different kind of influence? 

For now, Daigen chose to remain an observer. He knew that understanding the people around him, especially those who commanded such attention, could be crucial. He continued to watch, taking in every detail, from her expressions to her interactions with the crowd.

Though he didn’t make a move to approach her, Daigen stored away this moment in his mind. One day, it might prove useful to know more about the influential figures within his village. For now, he would remain in the background, learning what he could from the shadows.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) shook his head silently as he turned toward the ongoing conversation between who he'd assumed to be the instructor and his peers.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) blinked again slolwy, at this point he was beginning to get self conscious about his hair, was it really that bad?

<font color = white>&#34;No... I love my family. What&#39;s wrong with my hair? I think it looks cool, I go out every day looking like this.&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t know how to deal with this, he had never experienced this sort of interaction before.</font></font></font>

The boy was likely a Hozuki, Shinobi of Water.
<font color = white>&#34;Well crud...&#34;</font> She&#39;d think, seeing how her help wasn&#39;t even neccessary.

Then, the realization set in further, and she couldn&#39;t help but smile at the boy, waving back at him before pointing up, as she decides it was best to leave the boy in his &#39;area of expertise&#39;, and to have some fresh air, herself, climbing out of the water, soaking wet, afterwards.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: It's clear we're friends now.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I can grab a bite
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would drag the child against his will.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm, so young yet she has already kidnapped her first person.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) Daigen remained in his spot and observed the woman. Her interactions with the crowd were boisterous to say the least; her authority was telling and people responded with respect and attentiveness towards her. He noticed the way she spoke and took notes, understanding her building a strong rapport with each individual.
The boy picked up on a few key details, noticing how the woman often spoke about improvements and benefits for the village. It became cleaer that she was a local leader.
Satisfied with the information he had gathered, Daigen leaned back against a railing and took a deep breath while analyzing and channeling the information he had received. This would be crucial for him to build connections with influential figures in the future as he continued his endeavors as a shinobi of Amegakure. </font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Yes I would like a large bowl of ramen and make it extra spicy.I would also like some shrimp tempura with sweet tea&#34;</font>she would look over at the boy and would order him the exact same thing.

<font color = white>&#34;Sooo how&#39;s your day going beside having a bad hair day?&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) would walk in behind her, not exactly greeting everybody but just waving at them as the hair comments were still on his mind.

<font color = white>&#34;Well it&#39;ll be good ramen atleast...&#34;</font>

He would mutter to himself before perking up again as she spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh uh... Um... Well... It&#39;s been going well? Nothing super exciting... Just some training. What about you...?&#34;</font>

He&#39;d absent-mindedly begin running his hands through his hair, still a bit self conscious but relaxing slowly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) contiued to slurp down the ramen as she would move side to side due to her being in a state of bliss.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) would look at the ramen for a moment, unlike her he wouldn&#39;t slurp the ramen down but rather just eat it slolwy, careful not to get the broth on his clothes though it did not seem to be succesful as there already seemed to be a stain on the sleeve of his hoodie.

<font color = white>&#34;Mhm, it&#39;s good and studies... Well uhhh... I&#39;ve been kinda struggling... It&#39;s not as easy as it used to be...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) would continue to slowly eat his ramen.

<font color = white>&#34;Well... Just the memorization... I just can&#39;t get it down... It all just ends up leaving my head whenever I try to do a test.&#34;</font>

He would shake his head before sighing deeply.

<font color = white>&#34;Anyway, what about uh... What about you? Is it easy for you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Well... Aside from training...
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Not really.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: So you don't study?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: I uh... Try to?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I guess I've always liked training more than studying.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Training what?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Just physical training ya know?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Getting stronger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Ah so you're going to become a taijutsu shinobi?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Maybe...
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Probably.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah well let's head back so you can meet more people.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: You?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Sure.

<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: True.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: So.. I heard folks were fightin’. Which one of you NERDS got your butts kicked?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I would like to see a fight, Sogeki.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ...?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I'm always training.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ..pfffft. Get outta here, Daigen! You know nothing of TRUE training.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Hm, perhaps I don't. Will you teach me?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Bahahah!-
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) asks: ..eh?

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: You could make it interesting.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Mugen, Yurei (The long-haired boy-Mirageman) crosses his arms with a light smile, thin eyes narrowing on the community.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: A spar sounds like fun
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Ooh, A spar.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: The loser does twenty laps wearing weights.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Or perhaps I can locate a boulder.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s boastful laughter abruptly ceased when Daigen unexpectedly requested his aid. Caught off guard, Sogeki&#39;s left eyebrow quirked in surprise, and he fell into a deafening silence. He scrutinized Daigen for a solid minute, weighing the request and considering the implications.

Finally, Sogeki shrugged nonchalantly and extended his arm towards Daigen. <font color = white>&#34;If we train together, that makes us one step closer to being brothers. You understand that, right?&#34;</font> His tone was serious yet tinged with a hint of camaraderie. <font color = white>&#34;Only thing left is a nice cup of sake to seal the deal.&#34;</font>

With that, Sogeki presented Daigen with a fist bump, a gesture of solidarity and acceptance of the partnership Daigen had proposed. It was a rare moment of openness from Sogeki, acknowledging the potential bond that could be forged through shared training and mutual respect.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) squints.

Crossing his arms as he stood beside his new friend, the child would wait for a response. Hopefully it was a location with seating.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: It smells of lowborn.

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I'm not good with directions.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) approached the aggressive boy who talked about sparing.
<font color = white>&#34;We could gather all the other kids and start a small little tournament maybe see who the strongest student is..&#34;</font>
They suggested looking at the aggressive one and their companion.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: What the hell is that smell.

He staggered back for a moment, his senses conflicted by the sudden onslaught of raw vegetation.

<font color = white>&#34;Y-yes...&#34;</font> Sogeki stuttered slightly, recovering quickly. <font color = white>&#34;A tournament would be...

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: As I said, I use Kenjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Ah Kenjutsu.. we learned of that in the Academy.. not my style, but a delicate art nonetheless.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Not so much delicate as forceful.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) Sniffed the air, seeing the aggressive one sneeze so harshly, and felt self-conscious momentarily as two people seemed to react.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t apologize to me, cabbage boy!&#34;</font> Sogeki huffed out a sigh, his demeanor casual despite the lingering scent. He shrugged indifferently. <font color = white>&#34;Not like you can help it. Ain&#39;t no big deal.&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: uhm,i mean chunin
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's Miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh...the crazy one
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: So it's a chance to show them what skills you have and maybe impress a chuunin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) holds in a laugh at Najiro's description of a Chunin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Plus you get to see how you stack up to your peers
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) took in a deep breath, his mind instantly racing to address Rose&#39;s inquiry with his signature arrogance and pride. This challenge was an opportunity to assert himself and motivate others to step up.

<font color = white>&#34;The way I see it,&#34;</font> Sogeki began, his voice carrying an edge of aggressiveness and determination. <font color = white>&#34;We pool our ryo into a pot. The top three winners of the tournament not only claim their share of the pot but earn the right to brag. But here&#39;s the real deal,&#34;</font> he continued, his smirk widening as his arrogance shone through. <font color = white>&#34;Those top three? They&#39;re not safe. Anyone who didn&#39;t make it can challenge them. It&#39;s about more than winning; it&#39;s about proving you&#39;re the best.&#34;</font>

He paused for a moment, his gaze sweeping over the gathered peers. <font color = white>&#34;This tournament isn&#39;t just a chance to compete. It&#39;s a chance to show who&#39;s at the top and who&#39;s willing to fight to stay there,&#34;</font> he declared boldly, his tone challenging yet encouraging. <font color = white>&#34;So if you&#39;ve got any guts, if you think you&#39;ve got what it takes, step up. Train hard. Because this isn&#39;t just about dominance--it&#39;s about maintaining it.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s words hung in the air, a call to action wrapped in his trademark arrogance and pride. He knew his aggressive approach might rub some the wrong way, but he also understood the necessity of pushing his peers to strive for excellence, both individually and collectively.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would nod their head which would give off the notion that she was considering in joining this little game of theirs.In reality Rose had already made up he mind and figured just by watchng the fight would give her a better out look on things compared to joining the action.

<font color = white>&#34;I see it does sound amazing,but i&#39;m going to have to decline.&#34;</font>A smile continued to linger on her face.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eye would squint at the short red-heared boy, <font color = white>&#34;Oh your Uzumaki too?

Higane&#39;s right hand meets her chin, slightly obscurring her lips as she chuckles.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Nice to meet you and I&#39;m sure it will be easy to remember your name cousin!&#34;</font> He yelled out a bit, looking towards his cousin&#39;s head.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) arrives on the scene of the streets, where it seemed students were eager to start some kind of something. As an elder of the village, it wouldn’t go unnoticed.

<font color = white>&#34;And what have we here?&#34;</font> He asks in a very skeptical tone, brow raised behind the darkness of the hood and mask</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Alright ima go hand in the scroll then.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (test
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the mask man stopping mid step with a scroll in his hand.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh...Hello.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) wafts his hand about his nose, not much liking the smell of cabbage. Thankfully the smell didn’t really stick.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello young....student. What is all of this commotion....&#34;</font> he trails off, looking at the gathered many before continuing. But as if it were a new statement. <font color = white>&#34;About.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uzumaki, Nakagawa (The short red-headed boy-Godlike2909) glanced toward the commanding man, giving him a once over before he lowered down onto the ground, taking a seat.

<font color = white>&#34;Some kind of tournament is happening or something&#34;</font> He said as he raised and lowered his shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked flinched a bit as the commanding man waved his hand, and they felt self-conscious about their smell for a moment.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh, We are organizing a tournament amongst us students.
Miss Botan is going to oversee it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) Walks up to the group after hearing about a tournament and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh the kids are working on a little tourny, isnt that just fun.&#34;</font>

He continued to watch them to see how it woud progress.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) itches his chin for a moment, before loooking between the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Botan also going to be providing a reward?&#34;</font> He looks over to the Jonin, who would know this wasn’t a spectator from within the village. But one sent by the Shogun for the youth</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...i wonder if i can get wooden shurikens
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) spots the figure and offers a head nod. If he was luck it would be enough to lure him over to his side of the crowd. Should the jounin warp to his position a few words would be exchanged as they whispered to one another. Maintain a sense of privacy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) folds his arms while side-eyeing the jonin next to him. They reeked of something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) walks off to the side, half listening to what's going on behind him, while also just observing the body of water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shook their head.
<font color = white>&#34;They didn&#39;t offer one, so we were just going to try to pull whatever resources we had for the top three.&#34;</font>
They looked at the ground for a minute as so many high-ranking people appeared out of nowhere.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) kept herself still in the distance, their eyes seem to perk over towards the crowd with curiosity, the scroll carrier in the distance particularly catching up their attention, eyes press gently in a squeeze, only to widden again. They've managed to catch up the youngling's attention for the time being itseems.

A ceaseless, unblinking stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) noticing the boy nod to him he quickly walked around the group and made his way clumsily towards him. Not cool or interesting in the least. No teleporting or cool moves used. just akward <font color = white>&#34;excuse me, pardon me, sliding by&#34;</font> words as he made his way through the crowd. He would stop by the boy and smile. <font color = white>&#34;Need something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says:  We have nine people so if everyone pitched in it should be a nice little reward...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would pass the scroll to the commanding man showing them all the names</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I don't have any ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I am a jonin a rank above Chunin its nice to see so many new faces around here feels like this year is going to be an interesting one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) had paid close attention to the jounin as he drew closer to the cluster of children from the north. His posture, demeanor and tone seemed far too mature to be a chuunin. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Kryu&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You tell me..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Earlier people called themselfs bitch
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) squints her eyes from afar, nothing escapes the young girls vision.. Let alone a big celebrity like Shion.

<font color = white>&#34;Holy crap! It&#39;s Master Shion! He&#39;s like famous you know!?&#34;</font> She shouted over the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And their mother being a hoe
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Oh...another of the famous ones?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) reads through the scroll swiftly, with something tucked between the parchment now

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I can watch then 500 ryo goes to the victor, 250 to the runner-up&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) asks: A tournament? Now?
