<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) approaches the two black haired boys sitting on a bench. He was on yet another morning run.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) drew closer to the band of children, raising his hand to offer a wave he&#39;d politely greet everyone with warm hello. 

<font color = white>&#34;Seems like classes have been pretty few are between? am I right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: So..does anyone wanna play that dice game of 200?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: No money betting.Just for fun.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) shook his head, <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t gamble, I seen someone lose it all from his addition.&#34;</font> 

The boy could remember how much his father&#39;s rage when he lost a round in blackjack, and how frequently he went out drink to cope with his failed winnings. 

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, sorry... I try to steer aware from anything that feels like gambling&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) rose a hand to his chin, rubbing has he ponder on a solution. 

<font color = white>&#34;How about a game of hidden?&#34;</font> Where someone counts and everyone hides.&#34;
he suggested after releasing his chin as his hand fell down to his side.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Too easy for me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) eyes focused onto the blacked haired male, <font color = white>&#34;Oh really?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I have somewhat..better eyesight than most

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: We really need to get these teacher's schedule. I'm ready to start learning some real suiton jutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) asks: Suiton aye?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) released a sigh as it seemed as though he was pretty disappointed.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: That's what I must learn too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Yeah, are you a student?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: I am.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Would be nice to have someone to train alongside.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: Aye.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) asks: Hozuki.. Your clan also uses water, doesn't it?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Mhm, thats right
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Weird...
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Mitaki, Totsu has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Finally...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko(The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) OOCs: (Back)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) shook out of her daze and approached the Commander at his behest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) pulls out a single hand, gesturing towards Tsukiko and her shark-kin companion. <font color = white>&#34;If you can not follow simple orders then you are of no use. What if who you think to be your comrade is actually a mole? A mole only I know of. You would ruin an entire mission and operation. Can you handle that much? From the looks, I can&#39;t tell.&#34;</font>

He peers over to Nahoko.

<font color = white>&#34;Nahoko has good comprehensing skill.&#34;</font> He gestures toward her now. <font color = white>&#34;If I told you to attack Tsukiko right now. What is expected of you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) looked to her left, her gaze surverying those present.
    <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d figure out who Tsukiko is and attack them. Hesitation to follow an order can be the difference between a won and lost battle.&#34;</font> 

   The girl recalled her previous conversation with the Commander where he&#39;d drilled home the same point.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (feckin fake door.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (the building is a lie)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: ( at least now yk a hiding spot
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (they'll never see me

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Right....
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Well said.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess i will blindly follow orders then
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) fans the air dismissively. <font color = white>&#34;Yes. Yes, you shall. I will retract the expulsion.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and places their aching head in their hands. They did not like this lesson very much. This Uzumaki Commander was just as vicious as his elders had warned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Glad yer catching on now, Naji'.
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Like I spoke of earlier, this is no world of rainbow and sunshines
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yeah, its a world of older people beating on younger people because they know they can.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: One day, the roles will reverse.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is entirely untrue.
<br><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...sure..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) points to the ground in front of him. <font color = white>&#34;Come to me.&#34;</font> he says, both eyes locked onto the young Yuki.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) weakly gets to his feet, his legs wobbling beneath him. His equilabrium was still shaky following the vicious blow to his head. His eyes would lock onto the hag who had assaulted him for a second time, as he approached the commander. 

The small child would radiate an aura of hatred towards the fellow villager. In his mind plans and ruminations of vengeance against her already had begun to take hold.

He would carefully approach the red haired commander, staring up at him with their small stature.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes....Sir..&#34;</font>, he said, begrudgingly knowing that this man&#39;s order was the reason that he had been so viciously assaulted and beaten.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You were targeted and beaten.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: How do you feel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Well my head hurts and I want to pay that ha...girl back.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) visibly twitches.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You have potential.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Potential?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your shoes are in their grasp forever. After graduation, you are to take them back.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How am I suppose to do that? She hits like a professional sumo wrestler.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm too small..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Figure it out.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Did he just call her a sumo wrestler...?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Do not become complacent.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep trying.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Just get bigger.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'll pay her back one day, no longer how long it takes.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep burning in the furnace that is my command until you've become something worthy of being made a blade.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Am I understood?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yes...Sir...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Sumo..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Enough of this weak persona. Shed it thoroughly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pinched at her own waist. She wasn't fat...

...was she?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You may leave.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) bows respectfully not wanting to be party to another beating. There was something about this elder man that unsettled him. His senses screamed at him to not anger this man, although he had not done or said anything outwardly hostile. It was just a feeling that he could not shake.

Turning to leave, he would glare at the profound blonde. His cold icy anger boiling over as he observed his shoes in her grasp. He would look down at his cold pale feet which were covered in dirt, as he grasped his fists and trembled.

<font color = white>&#34;You will pay...&#34;</font> ,he thought, as he walked around the 2 savages and stood next to Rose.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (why everyone calls me rose XD
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Weird stuff... Weird stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Tsukiko, you will do everything in your ability to keep those shoes from his grasp.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Another battle between you two will commence upon graduation.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ngl,hopefully admins allow resets of stats.I feel that me being 12 and turning into 13 gonna screw me up XD
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Oyi, what am I mission out now?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (could try GM-H'ing and asking @najiro)
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Right. Though, I have to ask..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (think to suggest that in disc to see if they like the idea XD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) When the Yuki walks past her, Tsukiko only gives him an arched eyebrow. What <i>would</i> convey confusion invites something else. A dare, almost, for them to try their luck once more.

     <font color = white>&#34;When they lose then.. What happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: It will happen again and again until you lose.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I'm off. Cease your battles in my absence.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Aye, aye.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: That.. sounds like it'll be annoying.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yeaaah, very tedious.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....this is so stupid
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: What even happened
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than the higher ups want us to be brainless
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: noting else.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Oh...
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Cool I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Brainless?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: You still don't get it, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think he ever will.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I get we shouldn't question what we do
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But i rather question why shall i kill someone from our village if im not given enough information
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Because it's an order.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think anyone said anything about doin' that.. but you'd just do it because you were told to. Its not that complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: See...thats my issue.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Precisely.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There needs to be a reason
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's what's bein' a Shinobi is about.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: There is a reason.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: They said so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Picture this; Red Commander tells Beisame to kiss you. I don't think he'd want to do it at all.. but an order is an order!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess you will realize it later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If he tries to kiss me i will kick them in the croutch
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Why is it always weird around here?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Kinda confused as to what really happened here
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Eh? I'm not kissing no man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: But that's Big Red
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko(The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) OOCs: (omit o god)
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: But that's Big Red's order! 
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: You'd have to smooch Naji' or deal with the consequences!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Well, if it's a order, nevermind.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: It's just getting weirder...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....i guess you don't got common sense then
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) nods sagely.
