<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) breathes in and out.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) closed her eyes and replicated what Soichiro was demostrating. The silence was loud and she could hear the leaves twirling in the background. <font color = white>&#34;Focusing...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) help&#39;s her by watching her around. He then get&#39;s into the next step.<font color = white>&#34;Now to activate your chakra you must build it up from your body. Think about water alway&#39;s flowing. Breathe in and out and then you should feel it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Soichiro(The white haired teen.-Sora802) OOCs: (just got food sorry if rp slow

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) attaches herself to Soichiro&#39;s hand and steps into the pond. However, she was not adept at the skill and quickly sanked into the bottomless pool. 

The teenager splashes. <font color = white>&#34;G&#39;ak!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) would be worried. However it was time to courage Asuno. He would carry her out the water and sighed. It seemed she needed more time to learn.<font color = white>&#34;I think that was too soon. You know when you play the flute there&#39;s a melody. Think about playing the flute but using your chakra gracefully.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) groans while exitting the pond. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah.. I get it a little. Lets call it for the day. I need to get back to the stand. Thanks for the lessons, Soichiro-San!&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: I forgot what I was suppose to do today...
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: But I heard you made a lot of money and started making plushies.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: That's cool.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I wouldn't say a lot...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: But, I think it's a good start. You want to come with me to Ame to drop off this Plushie when I finish?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It'll probably be the same time tomorrow. Kinda' early.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Sure I would love too.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: And will protect you just incase.

<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: Mhm I will do my best!
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: For now, I need to work on my plushie. I took some photos of the guy so it should not take me very long to thread the doll.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) asks: Hm... how long does it take to make?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Maybe thirty or fourty minutes.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Maybe I can meet the shogun one day..
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: But that's another thing. I wonder who lead's the guild here.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Shogun huh?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: I've never met him. What do you think he is like?
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Strong...
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: The most powerful man alive..
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Cool and the strongest swordsmen.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Doesn't sound all that strong to me if he is only using a sword, Soichiro-San.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: I mean he has more authority then them village leaders!
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Really?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: I'm clueless on those things!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) sat down on the edge of the stairs leading to the main floor of the blacksmith. Bored green eyes darted between the two at th counter- before a hand that had been digging around in a bag found the rice ball snacks and popped one after another into her mouth.

After chewing for a long moment she finally said, <font color = white>&#34;They haven&#39;t finished the new floors of the Inn yet, it&#39;s just an absolute mess in there.&#34;</font> The words were a bit muffled from the addition of another rice ball. But non-the-less made sense.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Soichiro has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) Her attention is immediately captured by the sound of chewing, which she finds dreadful. It resonates in her ears like a low-battery fire alarm, causing discomforting screech in her ears. Asuno slowly turns her head to locate the source of the noise, and her eyes land on a woman eating a riceball.

Asuno&#39;s mind is flooded with a series of questions, like- 
                         Where is the Inn located? 
                              And why was it a mess?

The internal conversation is stomached like the riceballs and digested into an aloof expression on the blonde&#39;s face. She engaged, not by asking about the Inn, but instead.. 
     
       
                            <font color = white>&#34;Why are you chewing so loud..!&#34;</font>



The words blurt out unconsciously, a pet peeve having arose.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) The chewing stopped for all of .5 seconds, before something that looked round but this time made out of cake was placed in the womans mouth.
<font color = white>&#34;Not sure, this is just how I chew, never really gave it much thought.&#34;</font>

A smirk- not unlike that of the cat who spilled the milk settled on her lips as she brushed crumbs from her fingers.
<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen you at the Inn before- actually lots of new faces I haven&#39;t seen before. I&#39;m Cholynn operator and proprietor of the Stone and River.&#34;</font>

This was followed by a chuckle as the bag was set to the side, <font color = white>&#34;Are you hungry? I bet I could whip up a snack or three on that furnace back there!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) was thinking of what to say before looking at the innkeeper.<font color = white>&#34;How long will it take? It can&#39;t be that bad.&#34;</font> After thinking about how he would tell Asuno he would basically explain in his own piece.<font color = white>&#34; Well the shogun is like a saviour. I heard he saved  Iwa once and granted them gifts. He lives here as our leader and guardian. That&#39;s what my dad told me.&#34;</font>

After that he sweat&#39;s.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Soichiro(The white haired teen.-Sora802) OOCs: (They need to make a aki doc cuz jeez..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I guess.. I could eat something.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: Food!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802)  eye's widen. He could not say no to food.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc66>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) pushed herself off the ground and eyed the furnace, making her way over to where the water was she procured a pot out of the bag she carried, it was large, and seemed to clank and rattle. 
 <font color = white>&#34;Noodles would be the best thing I think, I didn&#39;t bring much else besides some rice and random snacks, oh and dried fish.&#34;</font>

Sticking her head farther down into the bag, <font color = white>&#34;I bet there is an egg in here...&#34;</font>

The bag is rummaged in as the water starts to boil, the noddles are added before the egg and what looks to be a few dried veggies.
 <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;ll be good! Not my -best- but good enough for spur of the moment.&#34;</font>

Bowls were found in the bag and set to the side before being filled with the noodles, broth, egg and- carrots and that does look like green onion.
<font color = white>&#34;Ta-da! Fantasitc, supurb and good too.&#34;</font>

The noodles were carried over to the two at the front desk first, and set down gently, before she wandered back to get her own.

Onyx chopsticks were removed from her bag as she took a deep breath.
 <font color = white>&#34;Any business today?&#34;</font>

A large slurp of noodles was taken as she waited.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) --Snnnaaap--

The chopsticks are torn apart, and the sound of splinters, popping in half, sing loudly in the background. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you!&#34;</font>

Despite having chopsticks, she slups the fluid and quenches her thirst. Afterwards, she digs in. <font color = white>&#34;Somewhat. I have a plushie design that I have to complete and take to Amegakure.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;My very first plushie. It&#39;ll be rare and designed after the individual who won my contest today.&#34;</font>

She slups the noodles again. <font color = white>&#34;I need to have it finished by tomorrow. Then me and Soichiro-San will travel and deliver the item to the winner. Good marketing, I hope!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0cd987>Akimichi, Cholynn (The bubbly innkeeper-AnolisTerin) slupped up a few more noodles, <font color = white>&#34;Oh a trip to one of the villages sounds neat. And good marketing indeed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) started to eat like a  mad man.<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for the food.&#34;</font> Having no manner&#39;s like usual he continued to eat like crazy he nod&#39;s at the question.<font color = white>&#34;Mhm and I will protect her while we get there. Just incase of course!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
