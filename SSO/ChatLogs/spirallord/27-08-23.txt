<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) was speaking with the man trying to convince them to let them deliver some more packages until a voice called out to them.

The strange food crazed one....

<font color = white>&#34;If it was not you saying that I would be offended. I am unsure. I have seen afew sleeping about the village but no more.&#34;</font> they said in their muffled way. Accompying it with a shrug</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) slowly walked closer while tilting his head. He still couldn&#39;t understand his blunder of considering everyone as prey. Where ws there offense to be taken when it was simply a food chian.

<font color = white>&#34;Why are preys always sleeping? How will you ever stop being prey?&#34;</font> He sighed as stopped a short distance away from the person. At least he wasn&#39;t asleep. Maybe he was getting stronger?

<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) asks: It is hard to disagree. I have some work now with this man. Perhaps you know of a Takumi Mines?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Nope! Elders tell me I'm too young to leave the city!
