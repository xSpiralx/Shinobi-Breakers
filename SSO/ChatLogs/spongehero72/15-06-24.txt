Perhaps that changes today.
While making note of those who&#39;ve reintroduced themselves, he goes on for himself.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) was very calm even though his luck went to toast. Maybe a comeback can happen.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times, he seemed to be hanging on by a thread.. the girl tilted her head rolling the dice again.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Isn't a pebble just a pebble?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Carefully watched him for a second, seeming to have fun.

<font color = white>&#34;Heh..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: !
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Oooh... we are drawing close!
<br><font color=green>*Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Wow.. Surprising.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Its more fun when there more people..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I normally play with my brother and father.
<br><font color=green>*Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hnn.. But what do you get when you win?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Mm Nothing, but father says to bet money when your older if you have really good luck!
<br><font color=teal>*Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) thinks: Betting money eh?..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) had the comeback of the season. But honestly making new friends was good in the long run.<font color = white>&#34;Yeah you don&#39;t want to go broke early. But let me know if you want to play sometime.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned.

<font color = white>&#34;Sure, pebbles can have things to admire about them, but they&#39;re still just a pebble. Replaceable.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: We can play again if ya want and anyone else can join!
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Fubuki tag in.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm winner rolls first hehe
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Right.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Off to a good start.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Nuuuuuu
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Welp...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) falls on her knees and clenches her heart.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: That's normal.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He really is destined to be the greatest ninja of all time...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Maybe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) liked this little challenge that had been going on. He rubs at his chin a little bit as he ponders his rebuttal. 
<font color = white>&#34;Sure! But they won&#39;t be like the others... Sometimes even pebbles have the most beauty in them. Like-- what if you find one of your favorite color?! And it&#39;s perfectly smooth? You&#39;re not gonna wanna replace that, are you?&#34;</font>

As he posits his arguement out there, he starts pulling a backpack from off of his shoulders, and starts rummaging through it. After a few moments, he pulls one out. Mostly smooth on the surface, with a lime-green color to it.

<font color = white>&#34;Look at it! Isn&#39;t it cool?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Well your move Himeki.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Drat
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Man. I'm second place, technically.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched the boy rummage through his own things.

<font color = white>&#34;It isn&#39;t that you would want to replace it...&#34;</font> She sounded thoughtful, as if she had begun speaking before the thought had fully formed. She squinted at the pebble, wondering where it&#39;s color came from. <font color = white>&#34;...It&#39;s just that, if you lose your pebble. You wouldn&#39;t cry, would you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Nothing that big.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Shakes the dice lightly and throws it against the floor hoping for some good luck.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Yay!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Phew.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Damm look's like I ran out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) peered up from the rock he was holding out toward Shuye as he listens to her. WOULD he cry if he lost this pebble..?
<font color = white>&#34;.. Maybe, maybe not - it depends on the memory I have with it I think... but! Even if I were to try and find another one like this one, nothing would be like when I first got this one. Here!&#34;</font>

He advances toward her, offering the lime-green pebble out to her.
<font color = white>&#34;If you keep this one, every time you see it, you&#39;ll remember us talking today!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nice.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Soooo cloooose
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: I shall nooooot looooose! Not agaiiin!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: I got this...I got this!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) was calmly looking at the dice. With his last last roll it was up to the god's.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) grabbed her dice and threw it to the water.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I lost once, its not exactly that big of a deal
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Luck seems to always change
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) was too calm about this. He would pat Fubuki&#39;s head.<font color = white>&#34;You will win next time.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What's going on?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Playing a game called two hundred
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Ah that game.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) sighed before reaching into the water with her arm and picking the dice.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah...sorry.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (Them some boobas.)

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I get competitive with games.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Most people usually do.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (Your picture doesnt match your age lol)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: We can  always play again?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (I know.  Alas.  All the six arm pics I find are at this age and with white hair.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (Have ya tried ai generators?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (Atleast I can go without changing for a good 10+ years.  I am no good with using AI generators.  They always mess up on me so I just use what I cna find.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) considered whether or not to take the pebble. The sentimentality was not something she typically indulged in. There&#39;s a little hesistance, as her eyes flick from the strange stone, then back to him, and finally back to the stone.

<font color = white>&#34;Fine. But only because it reminds me of jade.&#34;</font> She said, stiffly. It was clear shew as uncomfortable, but also trying not to come off as rude becasue of it. The successfulness of this attempt was up for debate. <font color = white>&#34;And I miss my jade stones.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) can&#39;t help but grin a little. He acknowledges her feelings, but chooses to disregard them for the time being. Mission complete..!

<font color = white>&#34;Great! Talk soon, Shuye! I gotta see what&#39;s going on in this game they&#39;re playing!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I think I'll pass...I've experienced defeat one too many times.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) has only lost once.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: You be fine.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: WHOA!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) is suddenly running RIGHT up toward the six armed girl, completely in shock now. His bright eyes scanning her like crazy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve seen some people like you around before but I still didn&#39;t really believe it-- did-- did you know that...&#34;</font>

There&#39;s a dramatic pause.

<font color = white>&#34; .. You&#39;ve got SIX ARMS?!&#34;</font> he exclaims.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: You don't leave your house much do you?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: I leave my house tons! I just look at the ground more than I look at people.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: I'm always on another adventure. Gotta find the best rocks out there to bring home!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: --
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hahaha, well okay then.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) turns to look at the guy who moves up behind her and pauses for a moment, huuuuh?

<font color = white>&#34;Yes?  I got six arms.  What&#39;s wrong with that?  It&#39;s a family trait.  And I didn&#39;t know that...&#34;</font>

Though she noticed that someone else was beside her, was she popilar already?  Was she already winning in life?  Wao, so exciting!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would slowly begin to draw each marking..one by one on the tiles of the sparing  mattt.  

She felt she wasent going finish her notice for a while...and felt like giving the academy students..something to do asside from playing dice if they wanted! 

Though this game wasent f-...this obstical course wasent for the faint of heart. She was indeed waiting for her peers to awaken...but what mroe could she do but entertain while she was on the payroll!

<font color = white>&#34;a-ah..&#34;</font>

She then turned to face the others and placed a hand on her hips!

<font color = white>&#34;This is the academy obstical version two....if would like to  partake please head to the starting line....this is not a drill...&#34;</font> She paused. <font color = white>&#34;but dont feel forced...this is more of a voulnteer sort of deal..&#34;</font> The medic soon stretched a bit before lowering their arms to their side.

<font color = white>&#34;if i remeber correctly..the rules are as followed&#34;</font>

== Rules below ===

[Roll 20 Sided Die] [ 1-5 hit] [ 6- 10 graze] [ 11 - 15  semi miss] [ 16 - 20 miss]

hit =  move back 2 tile 
 
graze = move back 1 tile 

semi-miss =  neutral

miss = One extra tile movement forwards

<font color = white>&#34;you can make a action that would delay your opponents movement, but make sure your judgement is correct or you will just be giving your opponent a window to win..mhm&#34;</font>  

She paused for a moment. <font color = white>&#34; Everyone is born with a different set of luck...this is just to see how lucky you are in this life..and what risks you should take on your future missions..mhm...so if you wish to do it..have fun with it&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: ooh I want to play!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#7d7280>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) <font color = white>&#34;---&#34;</font> Six what?
His eyes slowly shift toward the albino and he narrows his gaze on them silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Hm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) &#39;s eyes are LIT UP when she responds to him. He couldn&#39;t believe it. They were real. Without so much as skipping a beat, both of his hands are balled into tight fists as he begins to shake them from the excitement.

<font color = white>&#34; You can literally count to thirty with all of your hands!! That is so cool! You&#39;re so cool! You can also scoop up so many more rocks at a time than me...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) side eyes the taciturn aspirant before flexing her six different arms.

<font color = white>&#34;To fourty if I use my toes.&#34;</font>

She teases the two-toned one.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Whoaaaa...I didn't even think of that!

Keen eyes narrow upon the girl in front, the one with the light-purple hair. A whip of arm launched a pebble right for their forehead.

Managing to just barely slip away from her and continue jogging after the others. If that kid kept throwing pebbles... Maybe Hideo could actually win?!

Her speed went even further beyond, breaking tthe limits, and just barely...she stepped on the finish line. Fubuki slid and got on her knees, fists raised up to the sky.

In the meantime, he plucked up another rock.
<font color = white>&#34;Hm? Keep throwing rocks--? Huh? I missed the last bit. You wanted one? Here.&#34;</font>

He reeled back his arm and sliced it forth, loosing a stone right for the red-haired boy&#39;s chest.

As they passed him, the marksman loosed yet another pebble from his stash of naturally sourced bullets. It lanced through the short distance, seeking to peg them right in the ankle, should they fail to dodge. 

And with that, everyone&#39;s had a taste.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: So long as it's legal. You're welcome to ask Sensei and give it a try if she says yes.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Way more than me? I hope you give your old man a care package hehe.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It's tough to hit me with a rock though, so best of luck to you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I totally will too! I'll be rich enough to pay for everything you and Himeki need.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh. I&#39;m Uchiha, Reilin. Who&#39;re you?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I'm Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would find herself walking to the group as she took off her flak jacket. She was clocking out for now...to rest</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) half-limped towards the blond, trying not to put too much weight on the leg he&#39;d so kindly blown out from under her. She was also trying to pretend it didn&#39;t hurt, which she was failing to do quite blatantly.

She halted before him, surprised to find someone actually her height, and age amongst the crowd of young teens.

<font color = white>&#34;...Oi.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a slight yet respectful bow of head to their Sensei as they passed. A silent thanks for all their heart work.

...and then he returned focus to the Scruffy looking classmate. Who has stationed themselves before him. He tilted his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hm?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fuma, Katora(The blond lad-Iodized Salt) OOCs: [hard work* autocorrect, tch]

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) shakes his head, his son was a dreamer. It was good at least he didnt become lethargic, living an easy life under the jounin roof.

<font color = white>&#34;Good to have big dreams like that, keeps you moving fowards aye&#34;</font>,he planted his staff into the ground.

<font color = white>&#34;Dreams are the fuel of flames of greatness, fan it with your will and the only the sky is your limit.&#34;</font>,he noded sagely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: ...Fuuma. Mm, aye, guess that checks out.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. We are known for this and that.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: And you are?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ehh..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) squints across at the water to his father. The fiery wordplay causing him to smirk. Crossing his arms before asking,

<font color = white>&#34;You know, speaking of flames of greatness... When are you finally gonna teach Himeki and I?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) thinks: Lots of red hair..
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Ishii, Iroha. Ee-shee, ai-roh-hah.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) let the natural mufflings of his mask leave their name in shambles.
<font color = white>&#34;M&#39;shee Yeehorhah?&#34;</font> One might detect a smile from the crease of his eye. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Well met.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) frowned, at his son slightly.
<font color = white>&#34;You will learn with your peer&#39;s soon enough. Ive taught you how to fend for yourself at home,however your starting line as a shinobi will remain the same as everybody else&#39;s at the academy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) tilts his head backward. Looking up toward the sky as he sighs. Letting out a groan before looking back toward his father,

<font color = white>&#34;Fiiiine. When&#39;s that gonna happen though?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Iroha. I like that name.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) twitched lightly, although that could just have been the natural annoyance that seemed to rest on her face at all times, maybe.

<font color = white>&#34;Teach me how t&#39;aim like ye.&#34;</font>

It didn&#39;t sound like a request, but it wasn&#39;t spoken particularly forcefully either.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Gosu(The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) OOCs: (Did you respond I crashed)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) scratches his head.
<font color = white>&#34;In about a year, maybe...dont qoute me.&#34;</font>,he said with a cough.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: You want to be friends ?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Whats going on?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chonamu(The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) OOCs: (Mans was standing on me wild )
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: About a year huh? Maaaan...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) held a hand up, waving the Buritos off. <font color = white>&#34;No thanks. I&#39;m not much of a fan of salty snacks. I like sweet snacks.&#34;</font> she explained.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) nods in understanding, grabbing another fistful of chips to snack on. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Huh.
<font color = white>&#34;How.. to aim?&#34;</font>

Aiming. Aiming. Err. Exactly how would someone place words to an explanation like that? Internal questionings surfaced in the wrinkle of brow while he pondered. Uh... 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nothing special. It&#39;s not something someone can really teach as much as it is something your body learns. You just have to throw a lot. I&#39;ve been throwing things ever since I learned how to close my fingers around objects, so..&#34;</font>

He paused to pluck up a flat stone. A whip of arm sent it spiraling like shuriken for the moat water. It skips a grand total of seven times before hitting the distant northeastern moat-wall with a solid clack!

<font color = white>&#34;.. practice makes perfect?&#34;</font>
He shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: In short? I throw by feel. That sounds about right. Instinct.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So what do you like to do, Gosu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) rummages in his bag pulling out a package of Pocky. He takes two sticks out and places them in his mouth half of the sticks stick out of his mouth.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: So what is everyones names?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) watched as the rock skipped across the water with tiny &#39;Zoop&#39;s every time surface-tension kept it above the line.

<font color = white>&#34;Figures. Guess t&#39;was worth askin&#39; anyway.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Y'know the usual, I like to eat and sleep
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: You?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) raises a hand and waves toward the albino spider girl. Shouting to her from across the moat,

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: Eat and--- Those are just things everybody does to live!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I can respect that. It's smart to ask questions. 
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) yells: Eh...really! But I love it!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: If you would like to try some throwing drills later... I guess I wouldn't mind setting up some targets. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Daddy, do ya have any money?
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Sure. Ah can actually buy some throwin' equipment now.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: What's yer favorite snack?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: Pocky is my favorite.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True, true. That's a wise use of your little academy money. 
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Fer me, I'd say these Burito's

<font color = white>&#34;A decent way of looking at it. So. Did you get held back a year or two? Or.. did you get a late start?&#34;</font>

A moment&#39;s spent gazing across the moat, at all their peers, before refocusing on the tall one. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the latter. I gave up on learning my family&#39;s... <i>primary business</i> to do this. Never too late to start learning how to do violence for profit. Right?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh, not too sure what I like doin' for fun.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t let me catch you eating rocks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Eat as many rocks as you want...

<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be fallin&#39; asleep out here, dude. You might get eaten.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) eyes her up and down returning the energy.

<font color = white>&#34;Ill give you an allowance and you&#39;ll get to make me sandwhiches. That sound good?&#34;</font> He asks with a grin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) ||
While Shuye is temporarily keeping her attention off of him, he gives a few 'knowing' winks over toward the other kid's way. He has NO idea who he even is, but he's convinced himself... He will show the fellow kid the way before too long.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: Hey i could go for a sandwhich.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I want a sandwich.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I know a sandwich sounds good..Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Reilin!  I will adopt you for sandwiches!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) tilted his head. Err. Couldn&#39;t walk for a year-- 
Yeah, that sounds like the kind of personal matters anyone with basic common decency shouldn&#39;t ask about. So he didn&#39;t!

<font color = white>&#34;I see. Well. Best of luck to you, in your future laden with dodging rocks for the rest of the year. I won&#39;t go easy on you, if the legal opportunity finds me again,&#34;</font> he told them, wearing an unseen grin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: My new wife is making us all sandwiches..Just put your order in!

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I can at times.  Six arms gives a gal quite an appetite!

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: ... Now I -really- wish I had six arms...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was in a different state of mind when he's.... Focusing. He didn't even acknowledge his new acquaintances' remark, his body simply reacting to the forces with no reply.

Everyone's chakra felt the same, regardless of si--well, no.... Some people's chakra felt, subdued. Though the child still wasn't able to pinpoint exactly who was causing the... Discrepancy within his memory.
He could continue deeper if he'd wish, though it'd more than likely lead him to some unnecessary detailing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s listened to the offer given before taking a short breath. Just as she exhaled, her once somber demeanour had changed. Her eyes were piercing as she looked toward the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.. Who tha&#39; heck do ya&#39; take me for? Some kinda&#39; bum? Only one here who&#39;s gonna be makin&#39; sandwiches fer&#39; you is yer&#39; mum. Now buzz off &#39;fore I throw ya&#39; in the water!&#34;</font> she retorted. Her tone was vulgar and riddled with slang. Her once prim-and-proper way of speaking had vanished at the drop of a hat and she&#39;d tilted her nose up, even if she were shorter she found a way to still look down her nose at the boy. She almost seemed like a bit of a delinquent in the moment.</font></font></font>
