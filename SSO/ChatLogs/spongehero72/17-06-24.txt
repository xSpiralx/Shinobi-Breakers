The Akimichi would lash out with  his left hand in attempt to grab a hold of Meixun. If he was sucesss ful he'd aim to lift them by the front of their shirt and slam them into the ground.

He would then hear Yurei's words and nod his head.

Seeing his hand slice toward her waist, she quickly reacted. Twisting her body, she turned the streamers away from him as best she could, shifting her feet to maintain balance.

<font color = white>&#34;Impressive reflexes indeed,&#34;</font> she acknowledged, her voice steady but edged with a hint of respect.

Counter. Kohana steps forward, close to him...Probably too close. Both arms reach out in an attempt to grapple with him.

<font color = white>&#34;Another Raven here to scavenge. Huh,&#34;</font> he murmured. 

Meanwhile, his chop finds nothing but air. They&#39;ve dodged his retaliation. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hardly. I&#39;ve got a long way to go. We all do. But, to your credit...&#34;</font> 

Huh. They&#39;ve spread their metaphorical wings and encroached upon him. A grappling maneuver? A submission hold? No matter. It was far too telegraphed. Untying it just as one would a knot, he let them get close, only to suddenly lunge up and over them as if they were a vaulting horse. 

A hand harmlessly used their crown as support while he leapfrogged their minor height, only to touch the floorboards, duck and spin, slicing his heel for their legs. A sweep-kick. 

<font color = white>&#34;... you&#39;re doing better than the last one.&#34;</font>

His agility was impressive, but she wasn&#39;t about to let herself be outmaneuvered so easily. She quickly leaped back as he landed, narrowly avoiding the sweep.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve got sharp eyes, Katora,&#34;</font> she remarked, a hint of a smile on her lips despite the situation. 

<font color = white>&#34;But vultures are more fitting for scavengers. Ravens, on the other hand, are a bit more resourceful.&#34;</font>

She steadied herself, keeping her guard up and eyes sharp. A quick reach was made for his waist.

They&#39;re quick to return to him, pacing themselves, steadily making their way until..!
Indistinguishable from a cobra&#39;s bite, they went for it, seeking to bite fingers into his Streamer. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong. But. Calling someone a Raven is a bit more respectful. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</font>

Casual chatter made as he made like a Karate Kid and Wax Off&#39;d. Almost like a window washer&#39;s lateral wipe, he chops the edge of his hand into their wrist to divert the trajectory of their grab, leaving those fingers to take hold of nothing but air.

In kind, he steps into their guard and snatched for that dancing streamer of theirs, while she&#39;s yet to lean away from her recent assault.

His hands clearly rest upon two swords - one of which be a samurai sword and another which lie on a regular katana. A voice that sounds mechanical yet fluid seems to speak out, sounding more high pitched than expected. And like it had gears turning behind to make the voice.

<font color = white>&#34;This is...home now...&#34;</font> He whispers under his breath, looking amongst the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Hear ye, Iwagakure!</b></i>I’m an envoy of the Dakuteika - sent with a warning.&#34;</font>

He stops to see who amongst them would be the lead for the message. But since the other one that got sent to Amegakure never returned, he was heavily armed.A step backwards with a motion forward, for whoever would see themselves the leader amongst them to step forward and take a look behind him at the ten bloodlied headbands.

<font color = white>&#34;These belonged to some of your own, younger...<i>ones</i>, I believe. Much like those among your crowd. This is what happens to you out in the wilderness. You leave your village, and you enter <b><i>our</b></i> territory&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Two swords, and a bunch of bloodied headbands of the fallen. It causes his expression to sour. The message was heard loud and clear-- an obvious threat.

Being as short as she was, it was a bit tough to see through the crowd so she stepped forward somewhat to get a better look of things.

It was declared that some of the headbands belonged to their own. She cut a sharp gaze toward the &#39;messenger&#39;. Though unknown to her, she was visibly irritated that people from her home had been cut down. Someday her and her friends would be out there.

<font color = white>&#34;Tch...&#34;</font> still she remained quiet.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) arrives later than intended due to some difficulties. He stares at the man who arrived, at the bloodied headbands, and at the reactions of all those around him.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) lip curled, she was in no place to speak on such matters but she could not help but say something loud enough for her peers to hear. 

<font color = white>&#34;There is only one of them.&#34;</font> She pointed out and looked at the back of the older Shinobi. Would such an offense be let to pass? They had the bodies....but she was one of those bodies herself....</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) looked at sensei as soon as the headbands.<font color = white>&#34;So we are next? I hope not. But you got it.&#34;</font>The teenager seemed too calm and not stressing over the situation. He had full hope in his sensei to beat this guy to death. Taking out his book he would sit down and turn a page. He then noticed Shuye arrived and waved.<font color = white>&#34;Oh hey Shuye you came to the party or warning of this guy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Calmness remained with him throughout the stiff warning.

A Swordsman Messenger declared those he represented an enemy of their entire village. The foremost thought on his mind, reflected from a statement like that, could only be...

<font color = white>&#34;Their days are numbered.&#34;</font>
A soft, muffled murmur, beyond earshot.

More importantly, he&#39;s eager to see whether their superiors might shoot this messenger, who arrived here bearing the highest of hostilities. It was only karma. Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka)  From a squatting position, the girl would begin slapping the ground with three hands to voice her disgust for this kind of attitude!  This was sounding much like a threat, as if he was bragging about killing their genin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ayyo!  How brave!  Killing genin younger than yerself, must feel nice, ye?  Then coming to our gates?  Bragging?  threatening?  Ay ay ay ay.   Message recieved.&#34;</font>

Yeah, this Tsuchigumo girl was pissed, she was ready for a fight!  BRING IT!  Though as for making decisions or actions?  That&#39;s left to Bathroom Sensei.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) couldn't really see the bloody headbands because; his eye sight was awful, and because there were a bunch of people in the way. So the weight of the man's threatening speech didn't really land with the generally dumb boy.

But he did at least still understand it was a threat. It sounded like people had been caught by... bandits? Probably bandits. Outside the walls or something similar. A mostly uneeded warning for Hideo as he had no desire to go beyond the walls to begin with.

The guy had a bunch of swords, for example. What did he have? A cool rock he found on the way here and some loose change. It would take a long while before he was confident and geared enough to much further than he was right now. But he would go that far eventually.

Someone had to avenge who ever the messenger had, probably, killed.</font></font></font>

She sighed and stepped forwards...her students in more ways than one..each showing their own reaction but...most of fustration or well...taunting much less...an act of mmm....an act of...mm.

<font color = white>&#34;just stop it, you cant bind us to the village.&#34;</font>

She found her self looking back to the students..<font color = white>&#34;..mm...ehh..&#34;</font> they found their gaze falling back onto the man south of her. <font color = white>&#34;the entire wilderness is not your territoy.

What should sound and even look very rough actually seems much more inventive, smooth, more <i>mechanical</i>. As if he were filled with churning devices, and maybe even a static charge that slightly irradiated from him somehow.

To those with ever keen sight, his body had very clear grooves but not like the carving of wood into puppetry - it was more refined and held smoother parts.

He glances towards the ground for but a moment, as if stepping carefully for some odd reason. With those having their eagle-like sight though? The area was littered with hundreds upon hundreds of explosive tags - all the way to the gate

Hana continued to listen to the commanding man, her attention unwavering despite the discomfort gnawing at her.

Shuye's talents were lacking in this department. She was not particularly observant; she didn't have the uncanny ability to sense the energy in things her brother had, either. Worse, she was barely a genin, physically. No, explosive ordnance disposal was far beyond her capabilities.

She wouldn't have spotted them without another shinobi calling it out.

A traitor to the village, daring to come to the front gates...?

Was Iwagakure so weak?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) approached the scene, her eyes scanning over the crowd carefully before noticing someone outside of the gate-- Of course there was.

A sigh escaped her as she leapt overtop of the students, landing next to Chocho. Turning to face her for a moment, a smile is flashed, followed by a peace sign. She then finally turns her attention onto the stranger at their gates.
 <font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, she called out, looking him over from head to toe.

The camera in his eye was instantly spotted, alerting her to put her guard up. Perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps someone was actually coming to spy on them. Either way, it was work she didn&#39;t plan on having to deal with.
 <font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re just dropping stuff off, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font>, she began, her eyes looming over to the field behind him, noting the vast amount of explosive tags that were placed.

 <font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;know.. Someone has to clean those up, and it isn&#39;t gonna be me!&#34;</font>, she protested, venting another sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever..

HOwever...as the smoke settled..she noticed that the commanding man was gone...high into the wind...maybe feelings..unfounded..mm..un found....she then waved her hand to clear the smoke residue...as she watched their now broken stair case...probably covered in crystals...

[Aimed to protect those closest and behind her with multisize body block!]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) vents a <i>massive</i> sigh as the explosive tags begin to detonate outwards in. Perhaps it was time for her to actually take this situation seriously.

 <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s like.. The uncoolest thing you could&#39;ve done, random dude.&#34;</font>, she protested. Her hands came together, weaving through a flurry of seals.

With a clap of her hands, the Shingen musters all of her Chakra into the air above the tags. <font color = white>&#34;Doton: Otoshibuta!&#34;</font>

From out of thin air, a massive lid forms, hovering over the field in front of the group. The surrounding area was of no concern to her, the wall was far too sturdy for any amount of explosive tags to take it down.. To an extent.

The shadow that loomed over all present only lingered for a moment before beginning to shrink at a rapid rate. Anyone who&#39;d not yet realized a giant lid spawned in the air would quickly notice as it began crashing down towards the ground, sealing in the impending explosion.
 <font color = white>&#34;Man.. One of these days I&#39;m gonna need to get paid more... This is getting ridiculous..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I'm still deciding on you lot, but that guy definitely didn't pass.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: What is a vibe?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: It's something I have.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Yea. He sounded mechnical...Then like a child. All in one breath.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. His movements seemed a bit... mechanical.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nods in response. <font color = white>&#34;Looked like he was built, or rebuilt maybe.&#34;</font>

She shrugs. <font color = white>&#34;Who cares. He didn&#39;t look all that strong.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches in awe as his superiors demonstrate some pretty awesome techniques. Picking his jaw up off the floor he shouts. Interjecting in the conversation about a supposedly weird body the messenger had.

<font color = white>&#34;That was awesome Koume! Kitsumi! Can you teach us how to do that?! I mean- Obviously not the body thing. But the giant lid thing?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I wouldn't be surprised if he were rigged to explode as well.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Wonder how he spread all those explosive tags without being spotted...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: He didn't do something to the guards patrolling the wall and guarding the gate, did he?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) shrugs.

She noticed that they should have engaged with each other quite some time ago. So she was a bit perplexed by the delay.

A casual question&#39;s posed during the trip. Until...

...he dips, he darts, snatching for the kid&#39;s Ribbon like a Blank Mamba. If all went as planned? His fingers would sink into their Streamer like fangs to a Desert Hare. Yoink? We&#39;ll see.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) As Katora rushed in to snatch the streamer the Akimichi would lash out in an attempt to grab a hold of  Katora  and aim to throw them into the apporching girl.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) wasn't expecting Katora to be so strong when it came to striking speed. Much faster than she'd witnessed prior to this. Nevertheless, Chonamu seemed to be able to hold his own to a degree. Her slow approach continued. The way things were going she figured Chonamu would be defeated and Katora would then make quick work of her afterwards.

She pressed on.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Okay so that's Mugen.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: That's- kinda true, yeah. Still we helped!

     A palm became a stone splitting the rushing river that was the kid&#39;s Brutish Hand. Harmlessly smacking them in the wrist to divert the trajectory of their grab. Those fingers of theirs merely close around empty air. 

In turn? He drives a speedy jab directly for the kid&#39;s sternum.
<font color = white>&#34;Not bad. I can tell you hit decent hard.&#34;</font>
Compliments paid where they were due, while he side steps a tad. Keeping both of his enemies within sight.

With that said!

A simple skip backwards was all it took to clear the grab. Only to stomp right back into reach, aiming to tear the guy&#39;s Ribbon under his sandal&#39;s tread. Again!

But. Haste makes waste. He&#39;s not liking the sound of the Akimichi&#39;s latest utterance. It almost sounds as if they have a plan. And, well, he&#39;s already scored one hit upon them, even if it was by accident...

Hm. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got something fun planned too.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) snickered softly. <font color = white>&#34;Well I did think you could hold out for a little while longer, but I suppose I couldn&#39;t beat him on my own.&#34;</font> with this, the Uchiha took a breath before rushing forward to finally join the fray. Admittedly with her impressively slow speed it&#39;d take her a moment still before she would be able to get into the mix.

But given just how nimble Katora was, winning wasn&#39;t likely an option. She&#39;d take a moment to survey just how many ribbons Chonamu had. She&#39;d now be standing firmly face to face with each of them. But who would she target first?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (Totally forgot to keep round counter going on my markers lol)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) never underestimated an enemy. 
      Overestimation was key. Despite not showcasing such thus far, he suspected the Uchiha might be capable of clearing the distance to him in one stride, which would spell trouble if they saved such like a Trump Card. 

Therefore...
     As the latest heavy-weight hammer of a punch came for him? The Fuma Student dared to dash CLOSER! Yes, he darts into their guard, slanting out the way of that devastating STRAIGHT! It doesn&#39;t even clip him as he, quite literally, ran two steps up their torso. 

Chakra Adhesion of the Wall Walking technique made such tactics possible. He used them as a human springboard, pushing off his second step into a full moonsault, gone flying backwards. He landed on his feet and used the momentum to skip himself even farther. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve spent a good amount of time observing while we&#39;ve tired each other out... so I think I&#39;ve earned a breather.&#34;</font>

You&#39;d be able to strike either of us at least once and before we can manage to hit you, I think you&#39;d pull that maneuver again, no?&#34;</font> she inquired.

Honestly. That no-throwing weapon rule crippled him the most! But, he would not complain.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong, Reilin. Unless... you&#39;re hiding some serious talent at Taijutsu? I&#39;ve yet to see you throw a punch. That&#39;s dangerous.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Suddenly, she reached for her flute and brought it to her lips. 
     <font color = white>&#34;...!&#34;</font> 
As the first notes flowed from her instrument, a melody filled the air, weaving through the trees and dancing across the rippling current. The sound harmonized with the peaceful ambiance, creating a magical tune that spoke straight to the heart. With every careful touch of her fingers on the flute, the girl breathed life into the scene, calling all who listened into a nod. The music resonated with joy.

She appreciated the technical skill, but the music felt slow and needed more emotional depth.

As Asuno finished and introduced her plushie project, Kohana smiled politely, though her mind was still on the music. <font color = white>&#34;Not bad,&#34;</font> she replied diplomatically. <font color = white>&#34;But honestly, the tune was a bit too slow for my taste.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afro,i will check whats going on over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) needed a moment to realize she suddenly got a bunch of money from her new friend. <font color = white>&#34;Wait are you sure about this?!&#34;</font> then quickly she had to turn around to talk to the blacksmith, she was very overwhelmed by all of these things going on. <font color = white>&#34;O-okay then!

<font color = white>&#34;Keh keh.. young man. I already told them about the supply chain issues. But do you think kids that still smell of milk can understand?&#34;</font> he chuckles</font></font></font>

With that he wanders off to find his brother.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...buying their horse will be very wrong.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Well shiit'

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So yer' a merchant that doesn't have anything to sell?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) tucks the flute into her back pocket in exchange for a pair of white dice. 
       <font color = white>&#34;This is a game I learned as a child and I used it to determine who would have leftovers between me and my late brother.&#34;</font>

The tone was upbeat despite the tragic news. 

<font color = white>&#34;The game is simple and the winner will model and recieve the very first edition of my plushie collection for free. I&#39;ll start to sell them afterwards, and that is assuming you make enough of a name for yourself to earn one.&#34;</font>

The dice are thrown into the center for the group to expect. The numbers were digital-and advanced. <font color = white>&#34;The game is called &#39;200&#39;. Everyone will roll the dice using &#39;200&#39;. The number you get will act as your next roll number, and it could range from 199-to-1, it all depends on your luck.&#34;</font>

With a soft laugh, she concludes. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll keep rolling &#39;your&#39; lowest number until you get to &#39;1&#39;. The last person to hit &#39;1&#39; will be the winner. Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Maybe we should be talkin' to that one over there.. I think they said their name was Junji or somethin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shooes away the willful kid as he turns his attention to Ogura <font color = white>&#34;You are correct young man. The supply chain won&#39;t be fixed for a couple of months still.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: inspect*
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'm a girl..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sorry to hear that flute girl..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It's okay, that is a story for another time.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But alright...guess i will play,i already know im gonna lose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her attention back to A&#39;suno, and listened. As she started to describe the game, the smaller, blue-haired, angry-looking girl recognized it as the same game that other children had been playing near the arena. It even had the same name. She wondered if it spread from Akihabara, or if it had just spread to Akihabara. Either way, she was ready to play.

<font color = white>&#34;Prepare to lose, Yurei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah, right
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Hey, mista'
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's hope this one isn't just for show..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the explanation of the game.
 <font color = white>&#34;Sounds like it&#39;s based on a roll of the dice.&#34;</font> Therefore in his mind, if he lost, it was only fate.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got this. Their gonna be sowing Mugen dolls until their fingers bleed. Ehahaha.&#34;</font> He laughed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares at the plump youth for a moment.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) ponders for a moment. <i><font color = white>&#34;Luck..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) reached into her pocket--

<font color = white>&#34;Actually, I don&#39;t have a dice. Can I borrow one, A&#39;suno?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hrnn
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So how's it work? We place an order an' then you come to our village to deliver?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) sweatdrops</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) flips a pair of cubes in the girl&#39;s direction. <font color = white>&#34;Here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: We can start at Shuye then work ourselves clockwise.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I can come to you or you can come to me. Either works.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I just need a name and what you need.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) caught the cubes and then, with a twirl, unleashed them onto the ground between them!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Terrible...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: I've seen worse! Good roll!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will grab the dice and roll</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Akimichi, Gosu.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks to Yurei, since it seemed they'd be going counter clockwise.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Let me know when ya' got some 'rmor
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: . . .

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) would take hold of the dice and allow them to roll off of his hands gentley.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) felt to the ground, his rolling luck was habitually low.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How much do sets of shuriken cost?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Back to me, then...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It's over.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: ... People can uhhh....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: See! Katora gets it!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: But I'm stickin' with 'Red'.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: ... Expect the unexpected... because you're... maybe not... hideous?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Hm, nah. Somehow.. that one feels too cool for you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Then I'll just call you black, Reilin.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You haven't earned it yet.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's fair Katora, honestly.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: That doesn't really work.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Shut up!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Not my fault your hair is a boring color!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'll call you 'Ideo' then
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No offense to every black-haired person present.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Which is just short for.. uh
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Idiot
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: I'll call you Hide... not hee-day.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Raaah! You're all still thinking about it too hard!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It defeats the purpose...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Rei-Li, Deo, Turo.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: And Kat.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, Tora sounds cooler.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Kat makes him sound like a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: And you're Tsu! ... Can I be Ven?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Tora works.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Do you not like Turo?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Both the same type of creature either way.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Turo is cool, but wouldn't it make sense if-- well... if he's Deo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, you have to be Ven cause Turo is too close to Tora and it'd get confusing.

  <font color = white>&#34;Haven&#39;t seen anyone doing any combat training.&#34;</font> The young man sat on the ground comfortably and crossed one leg over his knee.

  <font color = white>&#34;Who wants to spar?&#34;</font> Yurei would be the first to officially make a challenge on the platform, smiling with casual energy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: But 'Turo' and 'Tora' could be a cool team up name...

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hey Yurei. I'd be down but we already know you'd beat me haha.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: You never know.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: When I learn some jutsu I'll beat people up

     <font color = white>&#34;Any rules? Limitations?&#34;</font>

With that said, he made his way to the majorly vacant center of the arena. </font></font></font>

  <font color = white>&#34;A Uchiha. .I thought they were supposed to be real strong.&#34;</font> He seems to blink a centimeter before looking to Katora.

   <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a practice battle, I&#39;m not sure what you want me to tell you.&#34;</font> Yurei stands and crosses his arms.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Fair. Weapons allowed?
