<font color = white>&#34;Hey hey, chop chop wife, you want that allowance, you&#39;re going to have to work for it, wife. Get to making them sandwiches.&#34;</font>

He gives her a playful touch on the arm as if he thought he was being loving and romantic..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Ill take my buns toasted, extra mayo with bacon and chopped chicken.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Tomatos, and add a little pepper.

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: You heard the crowd!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: We want our buns toasted!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Toasty buns!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) yells: Toasted Buns!!!!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Buns...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Beef Bacon in between...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) looked towards the red eyed girl and scratched his cheek.
<font color = white>&#34;Er.. I&#39;m just makin&#39; sure he ain&#39;t sleepin&#39; on the job, that&#39;s all lady.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) salivates</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: What job, is that?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Mn...&#34;</font> The boy grunts in discomfort, someone is holding back. Or, worse yet: <i>somebody knows he&#39;s searching for them.</i>

Shuye&#39;s words pierce through his concentration just before he attempted to trudge deeper.
<font color = white>&#34;Mnh? O-Oh!.&#34;</font> He acknowledges Kunigami with a bow, clasping his hands together in the process. His eyes burn into the two-tone head&#39;s face for a second, just for a second though--a rare occasion on his part.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: OOOH  IDea...  What if we do like CHEECE TOASTED STUFFED TOASTED BUNS?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave them a nod and left it at that.
Now then...

...what's going on over there? He's finally free to focus on the chatter. People-watching and such. He took a seat on the arena's edge, listening in on this talk of sandwiches and holy matrimony(?). </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Eh. cheese, sorry I blanked out.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: All this food talk, someone's about to owe me a meal after this if it keeps going...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) drools a litte bit at Tsuneko's ideal.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Apologies... I had a reservation of thoughtlessless for a short time.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) waved her hand in front of the dark skinned not-quite-teen.

<font color = white>&#34;What job?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) closed her eyes, a vein buldged across her forehead -- though hidden by her bangs. Her irritation had reached its limit and although this boy didn&#39;t mean any harm she found his words to be truly demeaning. How dare he try bossing her around? That was her job.

<font color = white>&#34;You idiot!&#34;</font> she barked. With a clenched fist she sought to bonk the boy on the head. While she didn&#39;t really have any strength behind the punch, if it hit it&#39;d probably leave a lump on his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll never marry ya&#39;! Tha&#39; person I marry would know that -I&#39;m- tha&#39; prize damnit!&#34;</font> Reilin exclaimed. 
(D- Agi. Not actually trying to deal any damage so I guess E Str)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) placed a hand on his hip and tilts his head to the side.
<font color = white>&#34;The job ta be ready whenever an enemy invades the village, woman.&#34;</font> he told her plainly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept up her scowl, unamused.

<font color = white>&#34;He doesn&#39;t even have a headband. He has no job.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She's got a point! Sh- Er, both of the girls talking right now I guess.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) pondered if she should kick him into the moat, just to get revenge from earlier, but figured it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea.

Well, it was, because she&#39;d come up with it, but it would come with a degree of future revenge, probably.

<font color = white>&#34;Have fun with that. M&#39;gonna go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: NO for real......Whos making those sandwhiches.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No one is big guy. No one is...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was completely off guard as he was continuing to take orders and was decked with a &#39;powerful punch&#39; that sent him flying.

<font color = white>&#34;--Gaaaaaaahhh!&#34;</font>

He slams on the floor while skidding slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hrngh..Ouch..Y-you&#39;re the prize??&#34;</font>

He grunts as he raises up to his feet, rubbing the afflicted area.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay okay..I think I get it..Ill buy you an apron before you get to making the sandwhiches...And a hair net!&#34;</font>

(Damage taken!)</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Don't worry..she's making the sandwhiches!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..Ouch..what a punch..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) moves over and stares the Uchihue into the eyes!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a great prize, mhm mhm.&#34;</font>

Hmmm, sammiches sound good though.

The spider girl would side step away again as she stares up at the sky.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: The wonders of youth...but arent you a bit to young to be asking girls to become housewives.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) had a strong suspicion they would try to push him into the moat too. Weird that they didn't.
<b>The Fūma would remember this.</b> Perhaps he would go easy on her the next time the opportunity to throw blunt objects at faces arose. 

Either way, he continued to sit there, with a water bottle in hand. Idly taking sips. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: YeJie.... Who is that large Tuediean with the red hair and stave?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Too young? My paw said to find a beautiful girl and to marry her!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I don't know, Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: So I'm doing just that!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Eh hmm..That reminds me, I wonder if she has any pepper corn ranch...
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: Hey wife! You got any pepper corn ranch for my sandwich??
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) suddenly begins to sweat a little bit. It's a very delayed response, but he can feel Shuye's looking in his general direction. His eyes wander in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Mmmmm peppercorn.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) points, this time more softly.

<font color = white>&#34;Mn... Ho...u as.....des...ions....th.....tong....in?&#34;</font> He murmurs for only her to translate.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) is looking past Venturo, to the tall man with the staff-- which makes his subtle sweat and anxiety even more funny.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) smirked to herself as she watched the children bicker. The mood was certainly boiling up to something edging on exciting.

<font color = white>&#34;Do not let that slight go unansweared young lady! I will owe you ten ryo should you make him eat such words.&#34;</font> She would march closer, a fire burning in her eyes to see more vicious bonks be delivered</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) yells: Yer' paw should have relayed it a bit better. Now all the girls are just going to think you are a creep. But uh..Good luck!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) glanced over.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey. The One who fell just before the Finish Line, considered quitting, but powered through with his pride intact. What&#39;s your name?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Six Arms, what's yer' name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her head toward Meixun then, giving Venturo a moment&#39;s repireve. She spoke, but the words didn&#39;t make any sense to anyone else at first, then.

<font color = white>&#34;You introduce yourself deferentially. Then you ask what his &#39;rank&#39; is-- He&#39;s old, so he&#39;s probably a chuunin. Unless he&#39;s talented, then he&#39;s probably a jounin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I am Tsuneko of the Tsuchigumo clan!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) felt satisfied after lashing out. Through she still held her fist up before lowering it just as Tsuneko made a remark. <font color = white>&#34;See? She gets it.&#34;</font> finally she slipped her hands into her pockets and looked toward the Troublemaker. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not makin&#39; any sandwiches! An&#39; I ain&#39;t marryin&#39; you!&#34;</font> she shook her head.

<font color = white>&#34;I might have&#39;ta knock more sense into ya&#39; if ya&#39; keep this up!&#34;</font> she stated. Though at the mention of peppercorn ranch she narrowed her gaze. Almost dumbfounded at this character. She could hardly believe it. But she did have an idea.

<font color = white>&#34;Listen.. If I&#39;m even gonna consider marryin&#39; you.. Ya&#39; gotta show me yer worth it.&#34;</font> she pinched her thumb and fingertips before rubbing them together, a universal signal for &#39;money&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (somber looking girl that profile ass
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) slowly steps side-ways along the edge of the arena. Moving closer to the masked rock-thrower while keeping his eyes on whatever thing is happening in across the moat. 

Leaning his head to the side, he says <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s Utsuwa Hideo. You&#39;re... something Katora, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) 's hands clasp together, his thumbs beginning to fidget. He's confident that he's the one being stared at...
... Then he feels her direction change. Something grabbed her attention, and thus was his time to make his great escape.. but he'd have to do it in a way that was subtle. One that wouldn't draw much attention. He could start running, he could leap across to the platform in the middle...

... Then it hit him.

He'd just... start walking away.
Very slowly.

Bit by bit...
Not once does he turn his head, to avoid making eye contact.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Xun? They have a rank of my name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) continues to rub his cheek and listens to the girl and notices that sign.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh..I think I get it..So to marry you I must get money! Do not worry, I will buy your love someday. Remember the name, Kaido! Iwagakure&#39;s most crafty ninja.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. Katora. Fūma Clan. 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Reilin do you like Kimono?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Nice to meet you
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Hey guys, we're going to have to put a hold on those sandwhiches for a while!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Nooooooooooo my sammich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a light laugh at the happenings across the moat. 
<font color = white>&#34;Ha... Kunoichi are scary.&#34;</font> A statement made with slow shakes of head. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Kinda cool. In a cute way.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: The Utsuwa family, huh? Can't say I've heard of them. What do they do?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched Venturo slowly depart, then snapped her eyes back to her brother, wondering which to answer first. Finally, she decided.

<font color = white>&#34;No, they don&#39;t. I&#39;d need to look in the textbook to get the exact definition. Just ask his name.&#34;</font> She said, before calling after Venturo.

<font color = white>&#34;Goodbye to you too then.&#34;</font> She sounded annoyed-- insulted, even.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Right, Kaido.. I'll make sure not ta' forget. I'm Uchiha, Reilin. Wish I could say it was nice ta' meet ya', Kaido but it ain't.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ehh, Kimono are nice.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh I don't know if my dad wants us to talk about that sort of thing or not.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why do ya' ask?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was merely gazing over the boys head, she did give a curious glance down at the fidgiting but alas....she was set to see the brewing lovers spat.

<font color = white>&#34;How calm it has become....I was hoping for something more entertaining to pass the time with.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: That's fair. Every family has their secrets.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I mostly meant the job-related stuff. Like, say, shopkeeping, blacksmithing, construction.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) grins at Rellin.

<font color = white>&#34;You won&#39;t be saying that when I become the richest in the village and a really successful shinobi..You&#39;ll be dying to marry me some day, Rellin Uchiha..So much, youll take my last name and drop the Uchiha from yours!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Hm? I dont care spread our name far and wide boyo! I do find it strange they havent heard of my last name. Moniker might be overshadowing it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) put a hand over her mouth at the mention of dropping her name. To onlookers she may have appeared shocked, but in reality she was stiffling her laughter.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh- We're all shinobi, I think. I 'unno what mom did before she passed. Or what our grandparents do, if anything. But dad's super cool and strong. And I wanna be too.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Right, I can't wait
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) has a pang hit him in the chest. Wait. Was he misreading the situation? He thought he was due for some sort of pummeling...but those words.. they couldn&#39;t have been for anyone else.

His contemplation is evident in the way he stops in his slow trek away. Not only did he fail in his mission, but he failed as a friend. As a teammate. As a lover of all things Earth.
To the child, these feelings all amalgamated into something he couldn&#39;t properly understand, but one thing he &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; know for certain was that it didn&#39;t feel good.

He turns back around, non-chalantly as if he wasn&#39;t in the middle of sneaking just now.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh? What&#39;s up?&#34;</font> he says, putting on an act. <font color = white>&#34;I thought I saw another neat pebble, but no.. not this time. I wasn&#39;t going anywhere! We&#39;re hanging out, after all! ... Right?&#34;</font> 

Accompanied with his act was probably one of the largest, most genuine smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) taps his chin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) nods firmly and shifts his body out of a stupor. Moving over to the Iron Vassal.

But. Each step he takes he gets slower... And... Slower. Something&#39;s off, the feeling&#39;s familiar--he&#39;s felt it infinitely back when he was younger, though as of right now? The feeling is... Jarring: it&#39;s warning him not to move forward, but that warning clashes with the nostalgia.
He bites his upper lip, steeling his resolve--whatever this unbecoming feeling was, it wouldn&#39;t dissuade him from getting used to the people here; and what better way to start than with someone of high statue?

<font color = white>&#34;....&#34;</font> He glares at the Vassal, eyes melding as per usual, attempting to dig something out of the man uncomfortably. Uncontrollably even, it&#39;ll most likely be something he&#39;ll never get over.

He speaks with the same, odious vile tone he&#39;s always spoken with.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was not the type to so easily forgive. Her arms crossed across her chest as they had time and time again, and would time and time again in the future. But the tuck&#39;s a little tighter, a little more standoffish. There&#39;s a shift in her weight onto the back foot, and a fierceness to her furrowed brow. Maybe it was the red eyes making it seem even more intense. He had been caught. He had been seen.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not sure I want to after that. Maybe I should give you back your pebble?&#34;</font>

She went straight for the gut punch.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) ||
Shock. Lightning can almost be heard striking behind him... metaphorically, of course.
Anything but the returning of a gift.
<font color = white>&#34;W-Wait!&#34;</font> he stammers, <font color = white>&#34;Didn&#39;t anybody ever teach you that returning a gift is insulting?!&#34;</font> he asks, beginning to flail his arms about in the air, even doing a little hover dance in place. Oh yeah, he&#39;s shaken. Defeated, even.

<font color = white>&#34;Lemme make it up to you! I&#39;ll help you on your next homework assignment, buy you lunch one day, get you another rock! Anything but that!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Strong team mates are hard to find.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: We need teammates...?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Eventually. You will.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: W-Why though?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I plan and prepare for the future.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Past Graduation... once you're working beyond the village walls. 
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: You'd want to figure out who you work best with now. Right?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Indeed!  It's best to start getting to know people first and getting togehter to make teams, perhaps!  Uchiha's are VERY strong.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) received the kimono and was impressed by how nice the fabric was. Surely it was not your average piece of clothing, quite a luxurious. . . custom. . . piece.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll have to try it on. It&#39;s quite now.&#34;</font> by now her delinquent side had vanished and her more polite and proper side returned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) was a Tsuchigumo and thus accustomed to gathering silks and the like from spiders or even silk worms.  SILK IS LIFE!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Hrm... Seems kinda lame to swarm her just cause of her family name though. Right?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A name's just a name. You're right.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) would not mention how many silk worms were boiled to death in the process of silk gathering...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: No one cares about her family name.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: But I'm going to have to ask you guys to give my wife some space.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I mean, people from clans care about their family name.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) held her ground while he made his energetic display in front of her. The silence radiating from her was menacing, until she finally spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need help on homework. You&#39;re probably a slacker. I don&#39;t need lunch bought, I make my own.&#34;</font> Her eyes narrowed, just a fraction. <font color = white>&#34;And if I was going to return your rock... why would another rock persuade me not to...?&#34;</font>

Oh, she was cruel.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Best to focus on personal skill, but to their credit, the Uchiha are known to produce quality shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Means people are gonna target them though, right? That's rough buddy...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You're not wrong. Sounds hard, with everyone expecting so much.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: What an ulucky child....
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (these clothes don't come off v.v)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) gasps!
He could understand the homework part. Shuye definitely seemed smart, and on top of that, she&#39;d have him sussed pretty correctly as a slacker. He often used &#39;charm&#39; to get his expectations lowered. It figures as well that she&#39;d be able to make her own lunch as well...

But what got him this time, was the logic behind the rock. She nailed him.
... Until...
<font color = white>&#34;To help kickstart your new collection of Venturo-branded rocks, of course!&#34;</font>

The shock seemed to be completely gone. He was smiling at her again, unphased. Seemed all you had to do was keep to the topic of these different &#39;collectibles&#39; to keep him engaged and excited.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mooonn, Shuye! You can&#39;t stay mad at me, pretty please? Extra please with your favorite topping on top? Do you even like toppings? Ice cream?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) shifted his eyes towards the youth, who slowly moved closer to him. His staggered steps causing the jounin to be a bit cautious.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm..&#34;</font>?,he looked puzzled at the question.

<font color = white>&#34;I am not..even sure who you are talking about..&#34;</font>,he patted the boy on the head.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) she frowned now at the display of....begging was it? <font color = white>&#34;He has now shifted into being sad. I cant stand to see such a day be wasted on groveling.&#34;</font> She spun on her heel and leaped. 

Landing on a tree limp before bouncing further away to explore the village a tad.  <font color = white>&#34;I will be back when events of note have reared!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (I def need help learning to be a Tsuchi.)
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: So.. speaking of the future. What do you plan on studying, Hideo?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Oh- All sorts of stuff! Whatever makes me stronger and more like my old man!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was unamused by his burst of energy. She really was a bundle of joy and fun, huh? They say act your age usually to disparage immature individuals, but what about those that were TOO mature, too jaded for their age? Still, the ice finally began to thaw when he mentioned those last two words.

<font color = white>&#34;Ice cream. Yes, good idea. No rocks, Venturo.&#34;</font> She slowly dropped her arms, gently relaxing her shoulders into their more natural, sloping state instead of tight, raised, almost square. <font color = white>&#34;You were obviously going to try to sneak off and surpirse me with ice cream.&#34;</font> She lied, offering him an out after making him sweat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair. I know it must be incredibly difficult to tell, but my focus happens to be throwing weapons. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah I figured with those pebbles you threw... Pretty good shot, man.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) is now wearing the kimono and no she did not get naked in front of everything she totally just went home and came back.

Anyhow, she&#39;d twirl in place. <font color = white>&#34;How do I look?&#34;</font> she asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ha. I can't call myself good until I can hit a moving target from fifteen meters away, with a forest's worth of trees in the way.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'm a novice at best. For now.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Nice kimono but you shouldn't take things from strangers.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Brother
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) seems to have found some sort of gateway.. one that could only work a limited amount of times. He shoots an index finger into the air, almost a &#39;eureka&#39; moment coming up as she provides him the out, as if he had thought of it himself.
Foolish, truly.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes! And theeennn I was wondering what kind of ice cream you even like!&#34;</font>

He&#39;ll definitely still be getting her another rock.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I'm not a stranger.  I'm Tsuneko!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hmmm?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Play two hundred with me
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: That's Tsuneko, we've met before.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Nii-san
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Eh? Sure, come over here.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: That's why you turned back, because you forgot that it's Matcha.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Oh? Playing the timeless game passed down for generations worldwide?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I might join you.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Right! 
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: It's scary how well you know me, Shuye.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm I have a one win so far
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Do we have anything to bet with though? I'm tired of playing for sticks and cool rocks..
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A local champion at that. Scary.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Wait. You didn't get any ryo from that course?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Ooo big number
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I did but I don't have enough for my family's clothes
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) finally relaxed her expression, her features softening and eyes widening.

<font color = white>&#34;What are you waiting for?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Oh...&#34;</font> An uneven mixture of fear and comfort condensed itself into the boy&#39;s core. The man&#39;s pat gave Meixun confirmation that he has never met this man before, not that it would produce any anxiety. So where did the familiar feeling come from? The razors that hover above his eyes shut tightly and he once again... Focuses.

To prevent from being rude, he answers the mystery of who exactly this &#39;&#39;Iroha&#39;&#39; character is. Eyes closed and body completely bent on analyzing the Vassal&#39;s signature..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Oh, right! Okay! I'll be back!
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Thank dad!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: I'll wager ten on this game. Fair?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) suddenly takes off. He really was going to have to go find an ice cream stand.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Ten's fine, sure.

<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Himeki is simply too strong...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A worthy opponent to meet our end by.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ugh.. this is the end for me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) nods to the strange boy.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ha... a rematch would leave me with cobwebs in my wallet, so I'll surrender. For now.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed confused for a moment. Clearly, the language processor in her brain was working overtime.

<font color = white>&#34;--kind of. Wonderful means... nice, but that word doesn&#39;t necessarily mean nice. It&#39;s... more... wonder, awe inspiring. It doesn&#39;t have to be positive.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You have a visitor.

Two ice cream cones in hand. One arm more outstretched than the other.
One, evidently matcha flavored, somehow pristine with a waffle cone and all.
The other? A simple, definitely melting rocky road cone. Why was one perfectly fine?

<font color = white>&#34;I have the goods, Shuye!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) cocked his head to the side, beady-eyed.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I did! From the obstacle course, and that game of two-hundred.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I guess it pays to be involved.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) quirked a brow at her little brother, confused by what he meant.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) inches a little closer, a little nervousness beginning to creep over him. If this thing started to melt!

Meanwhile, in his other hand, he had bits of chocolate ice cream already melting onto his.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) leaned in, searching for the characteristic green color of her favorite ice cream. When she found it, she&#39;d reach out.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, thank you. I was worried you weren&#39;t going to come back, it&#39;s been so long.&#34;</font> Just a little, playful jab.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) looked even more confused at the boys use of jargon.

For some reason, the matcha ice cream seemed to be freshly distributed, so why was his already so melted?

He doesn&#39;t begin to eat it yet though, even still.
<font color = white>&#34;Y-you&#39;re welcome... Sorry it took so long!&#34;</font>
A deserved jab. He&#39;d have to take that.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Doing what?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmmmm

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) naturally expected to not have her own ice cream melted. I mean, what kind of jerk would get their friend&#39;s ice cream before their own? Still, as Shuye took the cone, she can&#39;t help but inspect it warily. As if...

There might be a pebble in there, for some reason. If there&#39;s no indication of any oddities, she&#39;d go for a taste. A few licks leading up to a bite of the top, then a bite of the crispy waffle cone.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s ok. Do you need a napkin? Half of your icecream is on the floor.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) remained silent for a further moment and then some. How limitless is chakra even? It&#39;s not like--well, he does have a reference, though not to an explicit degree. He digs, locking his fingers together to assess the recesses of this specimen.

There&#39;s no end, none that he can familiarize, nor does it feel seperate, like before. That&#39;s where the caution came from, he concludes--his eyebrows rise up, attempting to claw his senses out of the bottomless pit he so foolishly tossed himself into.
<font color = white>&#34;Hehn-Zhaung...&#34;</font> Bottomless indeed. Finally, his eyes return out to the world about him...

He bows once again, a silent thanks for a selfimposed anxiety--he hasn&#39;t touched the surface of Mugen&#39;s strength, though he can now recognize the presence of one.
His knees give in and he stumbles into his younger sister, bumping her forward.
<font color = white>&#34;Ahi--!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) finally takes a lick out of his. It would be cruel for him to play that kind of prank on a new friend, so... while not today, one day... she just may find something like that in something he gives her. He&#39;s pretty content now that he can enjoy his ice cream as well, despite the great sacrifice he made in order to get to this point.

<font color = white>&#34;A napkin would be-&#34;</font>

But then... an accident?!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) finds himself shoved and rocks side to side in a stiff manner.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) attempts to follow Raku&#39;s vision, a gaze that might lead him right to the person he was talking about.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over the slit eye&#39;d one&#39;s shoulder. <font color = white>&#34;Mm.&#34;</font>, he hums pointing to the iron vessel.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) got bumped into from behind. Shuye was not a very big or sturdy looking girl, so she's stumbling forward directly into the boy. It could be a disaster of calamitous proportions. Two ice creams? One of them almost melted? She yelped, lifting her ice cream hand high to protect it. Her other hand waved forward, trying to grab at anything.

Would it be his scarf? His arm? Nothing? Even if Shuye fell all the way to the ground, the ice cream would be preserved if she could help it!</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;He was..&#34;</font>?,the man said to nobody inparticular, before squinting at the razor lashed boy.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) would've loved it if Fortune actually did favor him, even a little bit. With that sequence of events though it's unfortunate enough that the rest of his ice cream wound up getting pushed further into his face as a result of the light flailing... and with it, Shuye may find some chocolate ice cream on her hand as well, a result of the melting.

Double the pain for Venturo, though... he's got an ice cream face.

Shuye otherwise is likely more fine, aside from the bits of ice cream on her hand from her coming into contact with him so suddenly.</font></font></font>

She&#39;d pressed it right into his face to stop her fall. It took a second to register, and then she pulled her hand bakc and looked at it-- then looked at his stunned face. It was almost funny. She looked behind her, just in time to gather that her brother must have fallen backwards for some reason. She then looked back at her victim--

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m-- I did not do that on purpose. He-- something bumped into me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

What was ice cream about to do anyways, kill him? Still, there was a tinge of sadness this scenario provides. He can no longer fully enjoy his ice cream with his friend.

He couldn&#39;t let that bother him though, and Shuye is met with a smile anyways.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s okay!&#34;</font> he cheers.
He&#39;s hurt.
<font color = white>&#34;I can just get another one... after I wash my face.&#34;</font>

It&#39;s not looking good for him at all. Marshmallow, chocolate ice cream, and tiny bits of nougat stick to his face as he speaks. His reputation would forever be tarnished!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) still fell, though quickly recovered due to the elder's assistance. He pulled himself forward, dusting himself off slightly while regaining some composure in his spirit. He turned around to what seemed to be a commotion he caused, though rather, something more interesting caught his eye.

Sweets, on an unidentified individual's hand. A tunnel vision wrapped around his golded hues as they dissolved to a stained darkness. Independent of any formula or focus, the boy lumbered over toward Shuye's hand before he was close enough to smell the chocolate. Melted chocolate with marshmallow? Well, the marshmallow flavoring wouldn't do him wrong, the boy is very much lactose intolerant--and Shuye should know that.

He creeps in for a bit--a lick. A lick of the white and brown display.</font></font></font>

Who let this kid get so nimble to begin with? Even worse how they were approximately the same size... where was your gusto, Venturo? Much like a tool, he is used as a buffer, and soon, it seemed he'd be sent on a ride into some watery depths. It's at some point in this whole exchange that he just accepts his fate for what it is, looking beyond the 'fourth wall' (AKA, at the three on the platform across from them) with a face that clearly asks where it all went wrong.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) noticed that his brother wasn&#39;t looking and moved in a race against time to grab the waffle cone.

   <font color = white>&#34;Just making sure it&#39;s not poison.&#34;</font> Yurei said, before passing it to it&#39;s intended recipient.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) hands reach out and the cone taps against his palms.

   - Or atleast that what would&#39;ve happened. 
Instead, Yurei swoops in to save the day and he slowly opens his eyes.
     <font color = white>&#34;...Thanks.&#34;</font>, he mutters with a sigh. His line of sight shifting toward the water bound group.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) attempted to scale across his sister like she were a tree, though it seems his endeavors were dutifly halted by Venturo&#39;s tool demeanor. The cretin stretched an arm amateurishly out to the slit-eyed youth, clawing at the male in an attempt to reach some form of sweetness... Only for him to be retched away by a moving Shuye!

Moments pass before Meixun renders himself conscious once again, soaked, and on top of his sister, who was in turn on top of the two-toned boy. He scratches his hair slightly, wondering why exactly he&#39;s in a body of water when he can&#39;t swim.
<font color = white>&#34;YeJii...&#34;</font> He poked his sister slightly, legs tightening up in anxiety on not knowing how deep the pool exactly was..

His voice grew harsher, though more out of worry than indignance.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) splashed into the water, unaware of the danger that her ice cream had faced so readily-- or how it had been heroicly saved by a third party. For now, she had water shooting up her nose. She blinked the water away from her eyes and pressed her palm into the stoney walls of the moat of the arena, smearing the sweet, melted mixture until it was lost in the water around them. She didn&#39;t try to hold on to her brother, since he was so thoroughly latched on it was impossible for him to fall off.

And then, being the largest of the three, Shuye reached out to grasp at Venturo and pull him toward the wall. She&#39;d half hoist, half push him out without a word. <font color = white>&#34;Get up-- and pull us...&#34;</font> She mumbled, out of breath over the whine of her brother&#39;s voice. If Venturo complied, she&#39;d use him to help her climb out. There was probably a ninja technique that made this trivial that they all knew, being academy students, but she was a little too flustered to remember.

She almost missed Mugen&#39;s nicknaming, if his voice wasn&#39;t so boisterous and deep compared to everyone elses around here. <font color = white>&#34;Do not call me that.&#34;</font> Shuye said, perhaps a bit too sharply when speaking to an adult, but her patience was thin from her brother&#39;s antics.</font></font></font>

He&#39;s moreso thankful that he&#39;d been given the opportunity to get some of the ice cream muck off of himself, though it wouldn&#39;t be perfect given how brief the splashing was.

As he&#39;s moved toward the wall, he surely gives nod and understands absolutely what needs to be done.

Like some sort of cartoon character, he... lifts himself onto the water, using the exact technique that was taught to them in class to get onto its surface proper, all while taking hold of Shuye&#39;s forearm to assist with pulling her up too.

<font color = white>&#34;One, two...&#34;</font>

And then, a harder pull. <font color = white>&#34;Three..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Dad asked for everyone's names and people weren't paying attention so he gave them new ones and then they got mad about it.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Were you talking about me?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Who was?

You know you can&#39;t have any! Stick to rice candy.&#34;</font> She chastised him, before wringing out her kimono a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Zhu, Shuye. Not Candy Brain.&#34;</font> She announced to the taller Mugen, before turning toward the boy who held her icecream. She can see some is missing, but for all she knew that happened in flight. She moved closer, a hand offered.

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for catching that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah he didn't actually eat rocks. Just a call back to earlier today...

   <font color = white>&#34;Mugen, Raku.&#34;</font>, he then looks to his brother. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s talking about him.&#34;</font> He looks toward both the razor-lashed boy and Venturo&#39;s direction.

   It wasnt&#39; really clear who he was refering to.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks down to her hand and then mindfully resists the urge to take another bite of the icecream.
  <font color = white>&#34;Are you wanting to give me more ice cream?&#34;</font> The treat is slowly risen to his face to take a lick, if even allowed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had no desire to actually eat rocks. However, money was now on the line... He raises a hand towards the not-related red-head and calls out,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept her soaked hand outstretched.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a jolt of pain ripple through his skull, though he was too comfortable piggybacking on his sister to recognize the pain. She was also speaking so forcefully, I guess she&#39;s upset at him worrying about the watersi--

Wait, rice candy?! Oh.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh........Sorry.&#34;</font> He muffled into her back before raising his head to meet her still placed elbow. The pain... Oh wait she hit him.

<font color = white>&#34;Owh....&#34;</font> His delayed reaction caused him to roll off of her back and onto the ground below.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Hehehe.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) would quickly take a knee by the water and feel about for a pebble....she was merciful and did pick one that was well worn down. Perhaps it would crack under pressure? 

<font color = white>&#34;You will go far I am sure. They will call you the Stone crusher of Iwa after such a feat my brave boy.&#34;</font> she cooed and prodded the childs ego. The women left aross the rift and held her hand out with the pebble presented.

That&#39;s easy money! You&#39;re just jealous you weren&#39;t fast enough to call dibs...&#34;</font>

With a sigh he turns back the woman and nods. Reaching out and taking the pebble from her. Staring down at it in his hand for a quiet second before tilting his hand back. The hand comes up and tosses the rock into his mouth.

A loud clacking can be heard as he repeatedly tries to bite it. After a final defiant bite, he spits it back into his hand.

<font color = white>&#34;Pthoo, nope, not possible. Worth a shot though.&#34;</font>

His free hand reaches out toward her. Beckoning her to give him his well earned ryo...</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah, I am making an example! This is how you get money!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) took her cone. There&#39;s a slight nod of approval that he didn&#39;t pilfer further from the gift she had received earlier. And all things considered, it was still not as melty as the icecream Venturo had brought for himself and ruined. She&#39;d first go for another bite of the ice cream, her teeth flashing as she chewed the coldest bits and fought off brain freeze.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s green, though.&#34;</font> She replied, playing coy while watching the pair of ice-cream safeguarding brothers with her vermillion colored eyes. She &#39;accidentally&#39; stepped on her own brother&#39;s shoulder with her sandals, too, since he was still on the ground behind her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Dad is smarter then you nii-san. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) tongue swiped across her own chompers as she imagined that it had to have pained him.. <font color = white>&#34;That alone was impressive almost stone crusher of Iwa.&#34;</font> she praised. 

The women reached into her lavish clothing and....produced ink and paper. She quickly writ out a letter of debt naming herself (Papiyas of clan Niwa) required to retun the sum of five ryo to the almost stone crusher of Iwa. 

It was an IOU. She passed over the paper as if it was natural. </font></font></font>

He didn't seem to complain, not just yet... Deeming it for the greater good after all.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stares down at the IOU blankly for a long time. He was not a smart boy. Tucking the pebble into his pocket; he takes the paper in both hands and holds it up to his eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;This... doesn&#39;t look like ryo...&#34;</font>

The paper is slowly lowered. Allowing Hideo to glare at the woman from behind the IOU.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks towards the young man being pressed on behind Shuye with a small tilt of his head. His luck had ran dry long ago by appearances.

  <font color = white>&#34;Not what I was talking about.&#34;</font> He clarified quickly without thinking. He was instead reliving a moment in the past, pondering on how it would have felt to instead eat the entirety of the treat she had lost.

  He wasn&#39;t going to spend what little he had on ice cream.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: You're stepping on him.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Throwing a mountain huh..ive never tired it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) the women&#39;s gaze blazed a moment. There are downsides to dealing with commoners. <font color = white>&#34;That is a letter of debt. Surely your parents have taken on debt before yes?&#34;</font> 

She held her tongue a moment....<font color = white>&#34;That is to say only a fool carries wealth on their person. A sure way to get robbed dont you think?&#34;</font> She pointed a digit at the paper. 

<font color = white>&#34;That paper will legally bind me to pay you. I would reccommendd you not lose it.&#34;</font> She smiled then at the youth <font color = white>&#34;That is unless you would rather take issue with my lack of coin now? Spilled blood to wash debts aside?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept her foot where it was, thinking about how to respond--

<font color = white>&#34;Oh.&#34;</font> 

She moved her foot then, and looked down at her brother. <font color = white>&#34;Why are you still on the floor? I didn&#39;t hit you that hard.&#34;</font> She mumbled, before turning her attention on the boys, and deciding upon a nonsequitor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Shuye.&#34;</font> They&#39;d probably heard. <font color = white>&#34;But I missed who you guys are, other than something about -- mugen?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) got up without a second word, she must be satisfied now--right? Yeah, right.
He wrings out the girl's sleeves while she converses, just to soften any hard feelings left behind of course.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) looks between the paper, and over his shoulder toward his father. Despite the boys passion for getting money his family was actually really well off. But he had no idea if they had ever messed with debts at all.

Finally looking back to the woman he sighs. Stuffing the IOU into his pocket as he mumbles,

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re good for it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Hello Shuye.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) smiles thrice given the shape of his eyes. It feels as though all he&#39;s been talking about of late was his name.

  <font color = white>&#34;Mugen, Yurei. A-and my brother. He&#39;s here too.&#34;</font> The juxtaposition of him and his sibling felt congruent in energy, yet their looks differed slightly. . .
As if only having one same parent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) face twitched. No matter.....<font color = white>&#34;You will get your ryo I assure you. I would not so easily burn a comrades trust when I will rely on them one day to see my ambitions soar.&#34;</font> 

She went to go and sit at the water&#39;s edge, tucking a single leg under her and letting the other dangle off the edge as she placed her chin in her palm and sighed. 

<font color = white>&#34;Still a match of wrestling would soothe this boredom I am sure. Has anyone seen the sumo battle before? What a sight.&#34;</font> She day dreamed aloud.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I 'unno... I don't think most people present would be good at that.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) steps forward sub-consciously as the word &#39;Brother&#39; had been announced. No matter how aloof he&#39;d found himself in the situation he eventually pulled his focus toward the two infront of him by the simple redirection of his gaze.
 
   <font color = white>&#34;Mugen, Raku.&#34;</font>, he calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: It is not about being good at it. But the mere act of trying that sets us mortals apart. As you have shown already, daring a feat the rest of us feared.  
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hehe, well, that's just how I am. Destined for greatnesss...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I will keep an eye on your rise. Persons of action shall rule this world

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) let her brother wring out the lingering water in the fabric. She was hiding it pretty well, but it was cold out here in wet clothes. She started to shiver and took another bite of her ice cream, nearly done with it now as it was mostly a waffle cone with a little bit of matcha instead of the other way around now. She reached a hand over to her brother and gently palmed his head reassuringly. Compared to her and Meixun, they didn&#39;t look as similar as they ought to. She turned her head toward the six armed albino girl and tucked her chin slightly, acknowledging her greeting and returning it non verbally.

Shuye didn&#39;t piece it together, though.

<font color = white>&#34;So what kind of ninja are you going to be?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: But you eat rocks..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Nuh-uh, I *tried* to eat a rock. Which I was- er, will be paid for!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks upward toward the sky. In constrast to his brother the question seemed to push him into a daydream indusive train of thought.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) flicked the last of the waffle cone into her mouth, the crunching of it into dust as loud as any spoken word.

It was the youth with slitted eyes.

The creature slowly began to paw at the ground whilst his gaze remain locked upon it&#39;s victim.

<font color = white>&#34;RRRHHHHOOOOOOO!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She&#39;s not particularly fast, or agile, or strong, or durable-- but what she can do is use jutsu very well! Handseals are weaved, until the girl transformed into a spitting image of the slit-eyed youth as she slowlyl manuevered towards the tree. That way if it charged her, it&#39;d gore the wood, and not a person.

<font color = white>&#34;How do you even calm a bull down?&#34;</font> Yurei would hear his own voice asking him.

  <font color = white>&#34;Oh, no.&#34;</font> He knew there was no reasoning, instinctively he knew there was no use talking down this animal. It was dangerous.

  <font color = white>&#34;Anyone been hurt?&#34;</font> He found himself wanting to ask that. Instead he just repeats,
  <font color = white>&#34;Oh, no.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) assessed the scene from up above. Quietly murmuring to himself while he stood on his branch.

<font color = white>&#34; <i>Hm. An escaped bull. Or is that a cow-- eh... unimportant. It probably belongs to a farm nearby. They would probably be upset if we were to harm it, but we can&#39;t let it gore anyone, so... hmm... capturing a bull. Don&#39;t have any rope on me... </i>&#34;</font>

During his contemplations, he used those sharp eyes of his to search the creature for any labels, either seared on by Brand, or hanging off it by tag, that might suggest who the cow belonged to. 

[Using Eagle Eyes, got any notable tags/brands that might suggest ownership?]</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) eyes the bull before rubbing her chin a little...

<font color = white>&#34;Huh.  I wonder...  Reilin...  I want steak or hamburger dinner...&#34;</font>

She states eyeing the bull...  It could be so tasty if butchered and cooked properly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a rise of bloodlust in the bull's eyes, it was on a rampage; following silently behind his sibling and fellow youth, Meixun arrives to seeing his sister transform right in front of him!

Oh, that's what he's fell behind on knowing--the basics. Well, no matter, there's some things you just have to have a knack for before you can begin. What he can do in the meantime... Is dig.

He positions himself directly behind Shuye's disguised form, and... Sits down, legs and arms crossed he sits on the grassy terrain. His eyes lid to a shut, forcing himself the embue the surrounding motions for a time. Even if there isn't any spike in chakra on the animal, he could atleast anticipate the severity of the being's strike.

That is, if he's able to annouce it in a timely manner for those targeted to react.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) As several people being to act, the instinctual beast does what he must do. He sees everyone around him as a threat to his position as the head breeding bull back at Ram Ranch.

With that he explodes forth towards the slit eye'd kid with incredible speed, not even noticing the replica formed by the girl alongside him. His intention was to ram his head directly into the kid's mid-section, but at the last moment he saw the copy that had been made and pulled up. This resulted in him simply plowing through the kid and luckily not trampling him.

The bull then examines the area for his next target.

(Light injury to Yurei, having bull roll for next target.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) steps back. He didn&#39;t see the need to get too close to the beast as is. Still, seeing such a rage filled animal charge down his kin and them jump into action was rather interesting.

   <font color = white>&#34;Be careful, brother. It seems dangerous.&#34;</font>, he obviously stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [clone+henge
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was keeping its attention entirely on how the bull maneuvered, since it was an animal--obviously its signature wasn't to fluctuate as explicitly as a human's. Though the location bias helped exponentially. Meixun's brow furrows slightly, recognizing that it was attacking Yurei's signature. Meaning that it would be vulnerable to any sort of sudden attack by those who were willing to do so.

Despite his lack of direct interaction with the current situation... Meixun is wearing red... Crimson red.

A crimson red silk shirt, still glistening from the time he was partially submerged in the water--if the bull desired to attack anything red? Well.
But Meixun isn't aware of this mythos just yet, primarily due to his sensory form, he continues to mark the animal's movements, waiting for a moment of opportunity to arise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) In this moment the bull was drawn to the clones produced by the transformed girl. They...spoke to him in an unnatural way that beckoned him to them.

A sharp turn is made and an explosion of strength ensues as the raging beast charges directly towards the clone of the girl.

Upon reaching the clone the bull simply runs <u></u>right through it<u></u> and slams into the mountain with tremendous force just as the attempt to mount the animal was made. The impending shockwave forcefully dismounts Yure.

The bull; however, at this point is jarred by his collision with the mountain and takes no further action this turn.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) folds his arms and watches intently. He almost felt as if he were playing the role of some sort of instructor of some kind and in his he leans into said feeling.

    <font color = white>&#34;A bull&#39;s weak point is in the center of it&#39;s forehead, Yurei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Massive Bull(The restored one-Kristuria) OOCs: (dw about tile movement. this more freeform than anything)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) landed on the ground, chest eating the grass as he stained himself with the earth. He couldn&#39;t really believe what he was seeing, no way this was just a domesticated animal.
  It was something further beyond. The environment sustained damage, people ran, but by the looks of it the bull had been clocked by it&#39;s own explosive power.

 Hearing the words of his brother, he clenched the green blades of grass and took a stand.
  <font color = white>&#34;Feelin&#39; dizzy?&#34;</font>

  Yurei would run forwards to drive home a flying drop kick to the bull&#39;s face, just like he&#39;d read about in books.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt)  <font color = white>&#34;Yeah... they&#39;ve got this covered.&#34;</font>

He was not going to give that creature a chance to charge him. He remained within the tree&#39;s canopy, watching the others do with the bull as they pleased. It seems no one had the means to secure it, so violence was probably the only option. Its owner should have kept a tighter leash on their livestock. They have no right to complain. Not after their lack of precautions set this dangerous creature loose on the population&#39;s common folks.

From his spot in the tree, the Marksman pitched a palm-sized stone or two at the bull&#39;s crown, looking to disorient it further. He&#39;s skilled enough to avoid hitting anyone other than his target. Especially with the Bull sitting stationary. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Massive Bull(The restored one-Kristuria) OOCs: (Roll that drop kick for me big bro)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) had managed to lure the beast! She perfectly executed her plan, and the resounding thud and crash of stone and horn particulate that echoed through the park from its impact filled her with a sense of pride. However, Shuye knew that this was now beyond her abilities. She'd given what she could.

She tucked her hands into her kimono like a character on the victory screen as Yurei -- and potentially others-- went to deliver the knock out blow.

It seemed a rock might get there before anything else, though!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) gets clobbered by the rock as the drop kicking man found himself sailing past the bull and into the frail red eye'd boy. 

The bull was shortly thenafter subdued and returned to his ranch. Those who took part in the apprehension of the animal were duely rewarded.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) is flying directly towards the frail boy near the mountainside, the heroes music playing behind him slowly losing pitch, slowing, distorting into a loser's theme in-where he would only manage to cause chaos.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt the animal's chakra wane significantly, indicating the animal was properly bested. The boy comitted the feeling to memory--should something similar occur with someone of more active circumstances. Regardless of his participation; he felt his pocket become a slight bit fatter once the group was rewarded.

Staring at the boon, he walked over to his sister, handing her the majority. What does he need money for? He can't do much with it, that's Shuye's job anyhow.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Iwgakure? Hmmm oh ye' Dog Piss

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) checked over her brother to make sure he was not hurt-- and, oh yeah, dispelled the illusion. Being a boy was weird. She received his gift, and nodded.

<font color = white>&#34;Exicting, dìdì?&#34;</font> She asked him. She touched her pocket to pull a rice candy, only to remember that their spill in the water would have surely ruined it. Oops.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) goes to hit the ground for cover, but is far too late. The kick landing square into his chest and plummeting him into the ground by surprise.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) already was munching on the soggy balls of sweetness before she even gave tijme to consider handing it to him. He nodded softly, pulling the connective stick from his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;.............&#34;</font> He was very obviously speaking, though atop of his already whispy voice and the fact that his mouth was full, it was unintelligible.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) takes hold of the cash loosely offered to him. He then falls into thought.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) lands on the ground and then stomps in around the boy&#39;s body to get closer to them.
  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I think I got caught up with the bull.&#34;</font> He said sincerely, aiming to help them up with a hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) grits through his teeth, but couldn’t hold no ill-will towards his fellow peer. His thin arm reaches up to take hold so he can be hoisted back up.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Mugen, Yurei. Since that&#39;s handled I&#39;m gonna head back towards the north-eastern side of the village.&#34;</font> He stated before muttering something softly to himself.

  <font color = white>&#34;You can be my friend, and my brother Raku&#39;s if he takes to you.&#34;</font> Yurei followed with a nod towards direction of the taciturn one.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) suddenly felt embarassed, her usually quiet brother quite loud and speaking in a tongue most of these people had never heard before. It was harsh, tonal. She looked to her brother, and the word she uttered is only one; easy to understand.

<font color = white>&#34;Mugen?&#34;</font>

She then turned toward Raku. <font color = white>&#34;--It&#39;s how we talk at home.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) rubbed his face.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) looked at the frail black-eyed boy with a suspicious glance. He shuffled away from the boy but began to eye him with curiosity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to Shuye and blinks rather absent mindedly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) raises his head to meet the other’s sight, with a curt nod after.

<font color = white>&#34;I, uh...just wanna say six arms is really cool. Bet you don’t ever have trouble grabbing anything huh?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) says: Boo and Zing.. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You must look up Xing. Not-- whatever word you said. I would need to check my dictionary for whatever that is...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) blinked alongside Raku, something he said tipped Shuye's nationalism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) looked down at his arms, taking them out of his hoodie and clenching his multiple fists and wiggling his fingers. A slight grin appeared on his face. He had to admit, it was a bit of a funny joke.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes... the Tsuchigumo are the most powerful force in Iwagakure!&#34;</font> the boy said with a serious tone but also the naivete of his age.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Eh em...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: The six arms are pretty useful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) couldn’t help but smile at that, he enjoyed the pride the lad had for his clan. He felt very similarly, though he was constantly scolded when he brought it up - many punishments later it was something he didn’t speak of too freely now.

<font color = white>&#34;Most powerful force, huh? I’d consider my family to be the same.&#34;</font> He felt conflicted - he wanted to show up the spider boy now....but he was also interested in his person.

<font color = white>&#34;Two powerful forces coming together down the road could make them unstoppable&#34;</font> His mind deciding the next course of words for him. After all, it would be important to make friends and allies.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6699>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) Kohana&#39;s eyes narrowed as she focused on the six-armed boy. Honestly? He terrified her, and she didn&#39;t hesitate to voice her thoughts.

<font color = white>&#34;Can you use all six arms to cook? That might be the best use for those extra limbs,&#34;</font> she remarked as she approached, extending her arms and awkwardly crossing them. She had no idea how to shake hands with a six-armed freak of nature.

<font color = white>&#34;What is your family?&#34;</font> She speaks to the frail kid. Her opinion of him? His family must abuse, bully, beat, and belittle him.

<font color = white>&#34;With first glance, the umm...Six arms are better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) looks up to the kunoichi who walked over.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, hello, I’m a member of the Uchiha clan - but mostly privately tutored by my mother&#34;</font> She held strict discipline rules ever since losing their father in the war. Just hints of it would be strewn about with the way he acted - shy and mostly meek.

There was another side to him, though. One that was starting to pull while he spoke with his newly acquired Tsuchigomo er...friend? Enemy? It still remained to be seen. The little boy starting to grow into himself bit-by-bit the more he would open up.

<font color = white>&#34;I’m Kenzo, what about you and your family?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: YeJii... If gentleman Mugen holds a similar spirit to Mama.... But he is of one, not of two...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) rose an eyebrow as the thoughtful girl joined the conversation. He was feeling uneasy being surrounded by a couple of two armers. They were... different. 

<i>Cooking?!? The Tsuchigumo were warriors!</i>

But before he responded, he was distracted by Kenzo's response. 

<i>Uchiha</i>

Yes... the Uchiha were a formidable clan indeed. The blood that ran through their veins was strong. But certainly not as strong and pure as the blood of the spider.

All of that being said, Okuno was intrigued.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (sorry got pulled away for a sec)
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Mugen, Raku has gone AUTOAFK*

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) pauses as she turns to stare at the boy with six arms and raises three of her own to wave.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) tugs at Shuye&#39;s sleeve once more, it&#39;s been decided amongst himself that it&#39;d be best if Shuye understood what he did. After all, she&#39;s known best for a while by now, it would just be in bad faith to keep his thoughts to his own.

<font color = white>&#34;....Huigui muqin de linghun yexu shi keneng de maamaa?&#34;</font> His words were a knife, not helping by the overbearing and visceral tone which surfaces as Meixun&#39;s neutral state.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6699>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) Kohana stares at the freak...

<font color = white>&#34;Awkward...&#34;</font> Her hand retreats!

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah....&#34;</font> The rejection did not happen if she did not adknowledge it!

Kohana nods respectfully to both, her movements precise and controlled. She introduces herself with the utmost grace, a testament to the strict discipline she has endured from her own mother. However, again not as bad as it seems this Uchiha&#39;s mother treats her own.
<font color = white>&#34;A&#39;lass I am not of noble blood as you both. I am Hoshino, Kohana.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (misread your RP about crossing your arms. whoopsies. we'll roll with it)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (BTW!  I'm getting the Tsuchi bow and those Tsuchi throwing weapons iconed.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) glanced at the retreating hands of Kohana. Perhaps she should be bowing to their noble blood instead?

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to recognize our families. I am Tsuchigumo, Okuno&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) bows with respect in response towards Kohana, remembering to keep his manners about him at all times. It didn’t matter who a person was, as holding respect to everyone would find you your own. At least that’s how he’d seen it.

He was careful though, not to see his mother about. It was late, but there was no telling when she would be out looking for him. If she woke, eventually she would come to find him.

A respectful bow to Okuno as well, as he directs to the both of them. <font color = white>&#34;Well met. Have you guys heard much about what to expect as Genin?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: The jonin I would assume.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) points to himself when addressing the somber-looking girl.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed to rouse out of a stupor. His words send a coursing torrent of anger through her. Not at him. It&#39;s at what he brings up. It&#39;s one of the things in her life that made her who she was; that loss. That absence. It&#39;d filled her with the need to take up that role as best as she could, along with the role she already had of being an elder sister.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know.&#34;</font> She answered, in the more common tongue. <font color = white>&#34;I hope not. I hope she has moved on.&#34;</font> It was a mature take. One whose sincerity she struggled to actually hold. She missed her. It was hard to wish well on what you didn&#39;t want to lose when it slipped through your grasp. She almost left it at that, before remembering who she was talking to.

<font color = white>&#34;But if she hasn&#39;t, then you will find her.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: The struggles of a big family. Sheesh.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) asks: Being a man with six arms. Could you not make a mean stir fry?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) bows to his fellow Uchiha, <font color = white>&#34;I also expected the rest of our clan was snoozing. I don’t think we’ve met before now?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) says: I don’t often attend family events, not until I’m a Genin mom says
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) let out a sigh. He would indulge the cooking question.

<font color = white>&#34;I think if I tried I could make the meanest and most angry stir fry ever cooked! The timing of all the ingredients could be absolutely perfect with all of these arms.&#34;</font> he said, gesturing all of his appendages... eh em... arms... around.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (That's the second Tsuchigumo including me.  Which means there's still 3 more to come.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) folded her arms before chuckling. She looked toward Kenzo and could appreciate how formal he was. Though she didn&#39;t reciprocate the action. It was clear she was a bit more rough around the edges than him.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll be Genin soon. Then we can do whatever tha&#39; heck we want... &#39;least I will.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) grew a big smile on his face. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever we want, that’s right.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) turned around to his cousin Tsuneko, shrugging slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Wow, that sounds amazing!&#34;</font> she exclaimed, her tone filled with genuine enthusiasm. Perfectly timed ingredients in a stir fry? You could become the ultimate chef! We could franchise my parents&#39; restaurant and become disgustingly rich!&#34;</font></font></font>

It's a good thing he's so well attuned to this feeling, because, well--he's completely null to the more explicit physicality of emotional states.

He doesn't know that she's only affirming him to quell his prodding, though he accepts her answer nonetheless. He remains the hug for a while, not letting her loose until he feels her signature relax a slight bit. Until then, a silent embrace is all he can provide.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-Views.Saturn) says: Indeed. I can feel the ryo already. But first I have to figure out this genin thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) returned the hug, wrapping both arms arouind the smaller boy for a long while. Maybe half a minute, before she finally gently stepped back while pushing him lightly until her hands firmly grasped on his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;I, sleep.&#34;</font> She announced, dramatically-- like the title of a play.</font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re.. a higher-up?&#34;</font>, he questioned in an everpresent, gentle-yet-flat tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) didn’t seem to have his attention elsewhere much, so he figured to entertain the boy for a while.

Most, if not all of him, was relatively concealed. Under the cloak was some kind of padding akin to armor - and not only did he adorn a hood with it, but a facemask and mask.

<font color = white>&#34;In a matter of sorts, I am. Masaki is the name. Placed back home by the Shogun to watch over Iwagakure - another envoy from Amegakure was sent back home as well. I got lucky to return to mine, as they did with theirs&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) peers over from beyond the mask and redirects his attention back across the way.

<font color = white>&#34;He did gift us some of our most powerful. Only power can do that&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Yet, they aren't named in comparison.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks upward toward the sky as thought as contemplation plauged his expression. He parts his lips to speak, a certain ethereal haze present within his eyes.

    <i><font color = white>&#34;Dust from creation. Dust in decomposition. We are that which we begin no matter in which we fall.&#34;</font></i>
     <i><font color = white>&#34;Paradise to a commoner is that unacquired. But, what is Paradise to that who&#39;s acquired it all.&#34;</font></i>

He&#39;d seemingly mutter to himself in a trance before allowing his daydream like state to subside and focus in on Masaki.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I'm done with my meat-cutting for the day, I was hopin' to get into somethin' less dull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) walked up behind the white-haired person, peeping in to see what they were reading without invading their personal space.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Are you the son of a butcher?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn&#39;t appear to care much for the approaching youth, and simply continued to study. It quickly became apparent she was was reading about everyone&#39;s favourite topic of treatment methods for various kinds of fungal infections. In this particular instance, stomach infections, and all the not-so-pleasant symptoms, and how to quell them.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Fraid ah ain&#39; known t&#39;be much fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) shook his head, medical studies were an interesting topic. He began to see different roots praised for their antifungal properties and ailments which could be caused by an infectious encounter with them.
 Truth be told, he had no real idea what he was looking at, but caught the gist.

   Turning around to face north he speaks out while sitting on the ground.
<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s like a general goods man, has his hands in different things. Some of the meat will go to our home, some will be sold.&#34;</font> Yurei describes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn't look particularly happy with the topic, but what could she do. Hunkering down, and learning it was a simple requirement if she wanted to excel, even if studying definitely wasn't a fun occasion for her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crossed her arms. She thought about whether to keep asking him things about it, but instead shared about herself--

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m a vegetarian.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: So what you eat plants?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Well, not just plants. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...Actually, yes, just plants. I guess fruit are technically from plants. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) wrinkled her nose as the dust storm rolled on in, and called it a day for studying.

<font color = white>&#34;...Oughta get a pair o&#39; goggles.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: .... so dujsty.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: I get it, does it get boring?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Ugh, my eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Not to me! You can use a lot of different toppings.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked distant--

<font color = white>&#34;You don&#39;t want to know what too much meat does to you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shields himself from the raging dust and begins to make his way off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns, equipped with a straw hat on his head and another in hand. In a swift motion he'd look to offer the other to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes the hat and then places it on top of his head to wall the dust from his face.
  <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, Raku, what a surprise.&#34;</font> He stated with a smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods and parts his lips to speak once more.
  <font color = white>&#34;I spoke to a higher-up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Did they give you orders to get us hats?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: They said we may have the power to surpass the Shogun.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: The Mugen clan is that strong?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm not sure..
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Are we a clan?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Kind of, but kind of not.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: To be able to surpass the Shogun, you'd have to be stronger than strong.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Why would you even want to do that? 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: i kinda like the idea of peace area to meet other people in the future.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Not real sure.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I feel like the Shogun is one-hundred years old.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I was told that even he can bleed.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: And just as energy recycles, so does power.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I don't think I want power, Yurei.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) nuzzled his mouth lower into the collar of his hoodie as the dust storm raged across the village. Just another day in Iwagakure.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Mmh...
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: M'gonna be back'n a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Don't really get it myself. Maybe they were talkin' about the village, or themselves.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) kneaded some chakra in his mouth before opening his lips and depositing a golden coin-shaped object. He began flicking it between all thirty fingers.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) yells: It's still storming!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) returned! Now wearing a pair of goggles so she wouldn't have to squint.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It storms quite a bit...it's really annoying. I can't see shit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) shot a quick glance at his peers talking before shrugging and returning to his coin.

<font color = white>&#34;We have to be comfortable in it. If we&#39;re used to it, our enemies will have quite a hard time attacking us here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What if they wear goggles?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Doubt they could even make it through the front door.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Thank god it's over...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hello, hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) head flicks upward as the sandstorm subsides. <font color = white>&#34;Mm..&#34;</font>, he hums to himself as he&#39;d became lost in thought. Eventually, he&#39;d tuck away the straw hat in his void like confines and began to make his way off.

   <font color = white>&#34;Library.&#34;</font>, is all he says to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How's it goin'?
