<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) heads back off the bench and to the area he tended to see all of the others. A few people seemed to be hanging in the street, and a few off to the sides.

Seemed like business as usual to him, though he was unaware of something might be going on. He waves to the group and stands idly by. Just in case there was a gathering for a reason</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) smiles and nods toward the old man. Raising a hand up to pat him lightly on the shoulder while saying,

<font color = white>&#34;I feel a ton better. Thank you, old man.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) simply unveiled three-hundred ryo, counting each individual bill arduously in front of the young Uchiha.
Well--actually, on top of her head. <font color = white>&#34;I would expect you of anyone to understand the weight this... <i>demurral</i> entails.&#34;</font> One hundred Ryo.

The Zhu slowed down his count, moving further and further into a more visceral tone when he spoke, <font color = white>&#34;There is value within these mere paper marks. Indeed, such an amount--I believe your tongue for it would represent... Divinity? Roughly of course, though I would be astonished for you to recognize such a phrase.&#34;</font> One-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;Merely, in a triviality--it would represent a net gain for you, would it not?&#34;</font> Two-Hundred.
<font color = white>&#34;Just a simple game that you have succeeded in many a process.&#34;</font> Two-Twenty-Five. <font color = white>&#34;<i>What is to prevent you from....</i>&#34;</font> Two-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Complete and utter dominion?</b>&#34;</font>Two-Seventy-Five.

With twenty-five ryo in hand, the boy places it a the Uchiha girl&#39;s nose.
<font color = white>&#34;Defeat me. That provides one-thousand Ryo. And any form of assistance you would comprise.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm here for you all, youngster.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: So- What's even going on over there...? Meixun are you really gonna risk being her slave just to keep gambling?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) turns his head toward Meixun.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) took another sip of something and knocked himself right out! The liqour bottle was now emptied and Tooki can sleep soundly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) was astonished and completely taken aback for a moment. Was this boy, no this insect really counting his money on her head?! Of all places. This was nothing but utter disrespect. Who could assume it was otherwise. She grasped at the money, balling it tightly in a fist before thrusting it back into his chest with a bit of force. The Uchiha returned it. Her anger was prevalent and she hadn&#39;t even bothered to hide it.

She&#39;d continue to press into his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.....&#34;</font> she tried her best to contain her anger which resulted from the blatant condescension he&#39;d just exhibited. <font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t just a gambler. Maybe I didn&#39;t represent myself well enough. I&#39;m bein&#39; nice right now. So be happy. Happy I ain&#39;t Kickin&#39;. Yer&#39;. Ass and takin&#39; yer money after using my head as a table for your money.&#34;</font> her finger jabbed into the boy&#39;s chest with a few of the words she&#39;d uttered. 

<font color = white>&#34;You might just be the dumbest smart person I&#39;ve ever met.&#34;</font> she scoffed. <font color = white>&#34;Now then. I&#39;ll gamble with ya&#39;. And when I beat ya&#39; and if you can&#39;t pay up. Well, I&#39;m gettin&#39; my money from you.. from Fubuki. From whoever there is. But don&#39;t forget who yer&#39; dealin&#39; with, alright?&#34;</font> 

She&#39;d calmed herself down by now and withdrew her hand from his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s have some fun. I wanna take my mind offa&#39; that ugly execution anyhow.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Don't bet, Reilin.

<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) asks: What's this? Something interesting is happening?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) nosily peeps on the on-goings.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) beckons the beige-haired youth over and gestures across the road.

<font color = white>&#34;The blueberry is a gambling addict. He&#39;s trying to sell himself, and money he doesn&#39;t have, to keep gambling and try to the girl in front of him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (try to beat*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I also take no responsibility for his addiction. That game of two-hundred awoke something in him and it's not my fault.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I blame Reilin, honestly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) rubs the back of his head watching his kin blow up. He wasn’t entirely sure what was going on beyond the gambling. However. Using his cousins head for a table wasn’t cool.

He clenches fist and shakes a little, but Reilin had herself handled. Even within their own village it seemed there might be people to look about. That was kind of a worrisome sentiment.

But...surely the all of aspirant meant no disrespect? But he didn’t say so either. The boy, for his first time, was truly conflicted on whether to get angry or keep calm</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;I refuse, Raku. Unfortunately, this is no mere sport.&#34;</font> Not anymore, at least.

The boy unveils the set of cards, Human, Animal, Plant. He reveals the full amount to the Uchiha girl, prior to connecting the stack back together--handing it over to Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;As per usual, Tsuneko roles as the mediator--a non partisan. Should she rein the victory? The bout is nulled, Should she be victorious alongside one of us? The victor is the challenger.&#34;</font> Sure, a simple set of rulings, nothing&#39;s quite changed.

<font color = white>&#34;... <b><i>Xieji</b></i>. Eleven bouts.&#34;</font> A sudden deathmatch, winner takes all.

Who will reign supreme? Meixun&#39;s pride against Reilin&#39;s own? Meixun&#39;s devilish temperament against Reilin&#39;s fury-driven luck?

It is a challenge of.... Well it&#39;s probably not <i>that</i> important, they are just kids settling their petty differences.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Eleven? So high?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I suppose it's a large sum.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro)

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry kid, this one is for all tha&#39; marbles. I ain&#39;t lettin&#39; anyone get in the middle of this.&#34;</font> she said. Though she put on a brave face, she couldn&#39;t help but feel nervous. There was truly no telling how this would end.

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for helpin&#39; Tsuneko.&#34;</font> she said graciously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ah, draw.

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Null, victory of Tsuneko.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I guess yer' right. We should enjoy ourselves

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) used his left hand this time, pointing it at himself.

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Eleven bouts, if you were to win totally, you would require a minimum of six victories.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) scoffed, clearly the girl was attempting to con him. I mean, she did win a few solid bouts, all he had to do was look back on them and...

<font color = white>&#34;Yes yes. You won the fourth and fifth bouts pretty swell, however whenever we arrived to our sixth bout, to which Tsuneko gracefully interrupted my v--&#34;</font> Wait.

<font color = white>&#34;S-Sixth.... Bout...&#34;</font> The sixth bout? Didn&#39;t he choose animal? An--

<i>She won the sixth bout</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What did I disrupt?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled a shit-eating grin. Looking directly toward Meixun. She relished in her victory, soaking in his expression right now as the realization had dawned on him. He&#39;d lost. He&#39;d lost without even knowing it. Admittedly she too was a bit air-headed and hadn&#39;t even realized she won. But to lose whilst unaware was an entirely different thing.

She decided to draw a final card but did not flip it up this time around. She merely placed it down face down and ended her turn.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game.&#34;</font> as he hand pulled off of the card she turned it at the wrist, palm outstretched. <font color = white>&#34;You owe me a lot of money.&#34;</font> she said, still grinning and awaiting her deposit.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Good luck getting it, Reilin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) Five-Hundred Ryo. Down the drain.

For what, exactly? He didn't really <i>want</i> the money. Only the victory, but he couldn't even afford that much. His brain was circling indefinitely: the character for six, dancing about his head, collapsing on his thoughts with a paperweight keeping a stack from falling--though the stack is stacked too high, the paperweight only uses the stack as a diving boad and knocks it over. Translating every piece of paper with one singular character.

<b><i>6</b></i>

Two-Hundred Ryo, a crumpled mess--caused wholeheartedly by himself, returned back to its rightful wielder.

And....And now....

And now.... The remaining three-hundred.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled softly as a sum of money was placed in her palm. She uncrinkled the mess of it and instead of feeling happiness, she was confused. Her head fell to a tilt. <font color = white>&#34;I must be losing my vision.. Or I can&#39;t count properly.&#34;</font> she said. She lifted the money to hold it up to the sun but with all the sand, dirt and debris flying about it was hard to see fully. Nevertheless it was painfully obvious; this was not 500 ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Is this going to transform into 500 in a moment?&#34;</font> she asked, lowering the money now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: T-T-T-Tha....Is T-wo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I warned you he was betting with money he didn't have.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Two...Two-Hu.....

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: This is even less than you counted on my head.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why are you holding out on me?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Told ya, good luck collecting your winnings.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: He'll pay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) wore the slightest condolence in his eyes, for the dark side of gambling throwing someone into the red so rapidly and mercilessly. He gave slow shakes of head to the scene. 

<font color = white>&#34;Gambling is truly a dangerous vice.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It really is- Oh, I didn't even see you Katora. Hey.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Good evening, Hideo. I'm surprised you didn't join them.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Got tired of losing ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Just wasn't in the mood
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair, fair.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) How could he have been defeated!?

Actually

<b>BANG</b>

The boy knocked himself in the head, sticking out his tongue, Gon style.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry. Forgot one thing. I&#39;ve never won a single time I&#39;ve partook in such a challenge.&#34;</font>

He unveiled the final remains of the Ryo, smacking Reilin on the head playfully.
<font color = white>&#34;I would&#39;ve suspected a bloodhound such as yoruself to be able to recognize the stench of a proper sum... Ah well, suppose not.&#34;</font>
He still has the audacity to goad? Well, of course he does.
<i>He lost, he doesn&#39;t have anything left to lose anyhow.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hehehe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) side eyes Reilin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Suppose that settle's that, then.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Did he ever pay the remainder from the previous bet?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Youuuuuuu.....
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Meeeeeeeeee....
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Feels like I'm watching a crime.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Financial Murder. In broad daylight. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I believe the term is.... Extortion..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Its a crime he commit against himself, really.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s glee quickly returned to her. She added the remaining 300 to her stack of cash and thumbed through it to validate that it was all there. Once it was, the Uchiha tucked it away neatly in her kimono for safe keeping.

Though her smile had not faded just yet, she looked at him expectantly and without saying anything. Wide-eyed and staring. She heard his most recent words and this was her reaction. An unwavering stare, eyebrows risen in arches.

Finally breaking her silence. <font color = white>&#34;As I clarified before we began -and- you agreed. I get the 500 -and- you become my subordinate.. Did ya&#39; foerget?&#34;</font> she asked. <font color = white>&#34;I believe -your- response was... &#39;Should you retain the victory.&#39;..&#34;</font> her fingertips found themselves instinctively creating a finger-pryamid. Villainy.

<font color = white>&#34;Did ya&#39; forget? Huh? Did ya&#39;, did ya&#39;?&#34;</font> her brows rose even more, if that were possible. <font color = white>&#34;I guess -I- forgot about the initial 30 you still owed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. It's why I stay away from high-stakes gambles.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: A-Ah.. Subor...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (who took a bigger L. The prisoner or Meixun? find out next time on Shinobi Breaker Z)

He makes a mad dash for it, a maddeningly mad dash for it. So mad of a dash that the dust storm seemed to hold a horizontal vortex where Meixun once stood.

<font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Tomorrow! I promise you&#39;ll be allowed to... Aah! We shall discuss it further tomorrow!!!</b></i>&#34;</font> He screamed into the storm while fleeing.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) slicked his hair back, to uncover his ear. Almost believing that he&#39;s misheard them just now.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) hadn&#39;t expected this turn of events to unfold. Meixun made a run for it! And a fast one too. Much too fast for her to keep up with even if she wanted. Though she didn&#39;t mind, he&#39;d have to come around sooner or later. 

<font color = white>&#34;Right. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be seein&#39; ya&#39;, Henchmen #1.&#34;</font> she called out as he disappeared out into the storm.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m gettin&#39; pretty tired though. All this winning at life as got me feeling exhausted!&#34;</font> she yawned.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: T-That may be more important you already think...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: .....
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Apparently part of the graduation is going off to fight rogues or something...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yeah? Sounds challenging.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Getting some insider details from your Dad, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: He mentioned it during the uh... class.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ahh. I might've missed that bit.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It was uh, hard to pay attention to yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: For sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Lot of moving parts...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like that dudes fuckin' head- Yeah I'm not sleeping tonight.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a solemn few nods to that.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Sooooo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Back to squads and stuff. What're you good at Katora? Besides throwing stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I plan to learn some Ninjutsu. Raiton, probably.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Throwing and raiton huh? Good combo, I think.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: How about you? Have you done the chakra-paper-test in class yet?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Ha, did it a long time ago!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: What'd you get?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Doton and Katon, just like dad and Himeki.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I might study some taijutsu later too. Not sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Or throwing stuff. All good choices...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Mm. Never a bad idea to dabble. 
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Sounds like you kids have it all figured out. A solid duo
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Maybe. How about you, Papiyas? Given your future any thought?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: I know you have your Kenjutsu... but will you branch out?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm not sure I'd call us a duo though.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I second that. Finding suitable squadmates demands a bit more thought.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Not that I don't like you Katora- You're cool. Weird, but cool. But yeah it takes a lot more thought than us just being the two guys who have an idea.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Gotta interrogate our classmates and really give it a think.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You'll be trusting one another with your lives, after all. There's a lot to consider.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Exactly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (sorry gaming)
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I will be a sword saint. I will make the budda blush with each swing of my blades
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Anything else....uneeded.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Dedicated to your craft. I can respect that.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (costs me 89 points to go my build. Thats without OED. Cores and mostly 2 handed is full build.)
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: ....Where am I?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Iwa again.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Thought you could smell us old man
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Man, I've never been up this late. Is it always this quiet?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: More or less. But there tends to be a high point
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Oh yeah? When's it gonna be you think?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: At any point....but its truely up in the air. My life has moved so fast it nearly feels like it could all be condensed down into afew days.....or perhaps I am rambling hahaha
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-No, no, I know what you mean.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Could always peek at the gates or up where the business from earlier took place. Surely some Shinobi are lingering about
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: The gate, maybe. But... I really don't wanna see the stage again for a few days.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) nods her head. She could understand the feeling. <font color = white>&#34;They say all return to heaven. Even the bad are recycled. So not something to fret about.&#34;</font> 
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean the guys soul isn't what I'm concerned about...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Oh? Hmm....I cannot say I understand your worries then.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Y-You don't have a problem with watchin' a guy get his head bashed in, and then sent flying? And a your classmates covered in his blood?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) hummed again. She stroked her chin as she gave the boys words some consideration. She had hardly dwelled on the events, afterall she knew what she signed up for. 

<font color = white>&#34;No I cannot say it is that suprising. I have seen death tho not so.....graphic.&#34;</font> her voice trailed in a moment of thought. 

<font color = white>&#34;I signed up to be a Shinobi, once in history it was the custom to sever your kills heads to prove you had done your job. All is mandated by heaven, ultimately how one dies is irrelevant. What matters is what we accomplish in this mortal plane.&#34;</font> She smiled then. Surely the lad would now understand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stared at the woman for a few quiet moments. Trying to process her funny words. Not really understanding most of the spiritual jargon though due to being an idiot. But he did at least understand <i>part</i> of it,

<font color = white>&#34;I &#39;unno man... I think the way you dies matters a ton. If it&#39;s slow and brutal and humiliating that kinda fuckin&#39; sucks. Don&#39;t you think?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Like- dying on a mission is one thing. But being put on display for a bunch of kids?!
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I may call you children but.....what do you think happens to someone if you actually hit them with one or two of those paper bombs? It will be much worse than a simple beheading. Truely if you dont behead them soon afterwords it could be very terrible. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Like I said a mission is one thing- But being an example like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: They should've like... Stabbed him in the heart or something. Not beat him up a ton and then sent his head flying like that...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: My sister didn't need to see that...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I disagree....once word spreads it will keep you and your sister safe from harm. The fear will grip those in the shadows thinking of harming us.  
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'd rather not live in a world where everyone's just afraid of one another...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Then you prefer strangers carrying the headband of me, or your sister? The truth is I doubt just a killing will stop us from being attacked if we venture outside the village.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Seems like everyone is sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I never said any of that! Just that friends are less likely to attack you than people who hate you.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hey Chobina. We're just talkin' about the 'class' earlier.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Oh I wasnt there!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: What happened
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: My dad beat up a prisoner really badly and gave a speech about strength being important. Then Kitsumi cut his head off.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: The samurai?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I 'unno. Never saw the guy before.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh, well they shouldnt have done bad! Sucks that they died tough. Death is so scary.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Right?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Finally someone else fuckin' agrees! I swear half our class is like, psychopaths or something. No one seems to care that the dude's blood sprayed the entire front row.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Everyone's just like 'oh death is cool and fine and doesn't matter haha.' And I'm like... Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: It does take a scary mindset to not be off put by death. Even though we are child soliders. death is still scary.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: You need to have a screw loose for this kind of work
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and lets out an exasperated sighs. Mumbling to no one in particular,

<font color = white>&#34;I swear some people even fucking enjoyed the whole ordeal...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Dying on a mission is one thing. You can at least know you did your best. That your squad is trying to avenge you or whatever. But a prisoner like that? In such a brutal way? It's just messed up man..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I don't like that the beast is doing to my dad...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: He wasnt always like that?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head again, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve <b>never</b> seen him get like that before. And I&#39;ve really pissed him off plenty of times. He even had this like... steam or something coming off of him and this weird red chakra...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Scary
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Makes me glad I'll never be picked to be the next vessel.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I can say the same thinking back to my own family.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: You can?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Yea... they were trying to make my family a vessel but he didnt like that and ignoed the rules. So they killed him when he rampaged.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Daaamn... My condolences.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (I was gone 2 secs! A val match started)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Valorant player spotted
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Hello Chobina...

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Hey Papaya~
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I hope dad doesn't make that kind of mistake either.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: We will have to grow stronger together to prevent it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Heh, was already the plan! Just another reason to make it happen though.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Mhm~
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Talk of squads was discussed earlier
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Oh, yeah. What kind of stuff are you planning to do Chobina?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Be great, throw rocks, help my friends and get strong!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: No way you wanna throw rocks too?!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean technically my thing is throwing mountains but-
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I bet I can throw mountains eventually~
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I hope so. It'll be lame if I'm the only one who can!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I am known as the rocks thrower.~
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: I knocked a samurai out with one!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No kidding? That's pretty awesome.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I was meaning to inquire about his sword....I had forgot
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Yea it is~
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Maybe next time Papaya
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Papiyas....
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Do you not like the nickname?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: You know- I never asked. Is Papiyas your given name, or your family name?
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: Given. I am of the Niwa family.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh, good to know.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: In truth...I dont know your or your fathers names
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh- Yeah I was hoping you just heard my name get shouted around or something haha.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm Hideo, he's Mugen, and we're Utsuwa.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) says: Mmmm.. A little tired, and baffled. I need to pay more attention to what's been going on.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh you sound like your abit aloof
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Whats your name?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) asks: Hmm.. Maybe. I'm Suzaku. What about you?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) placed her hands on her hips. <font color = white>&#34;Im Chobina Akimichi. Its nice to meet you.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh, you look like you're kinda related to Reilin, Suzaku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) brought her balled-up fists to her eyes, rubbing them gently as if the morning light was too much to bear. She blinked, trying to focus, and as her vision cleared, she found herself squinting at Chobina.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you too, Chobin.,&#34;</font> she said, her voice still held the softness of sleep. She lowered her body into a formal, polite bow, a gesture of respect that seemed almost out of place in the haze of early morning.

Rising slowly, she hesitated, her mind drifting to the conversation she had overheard earlier. Her face adopted a puzzled expression, and she bit her lip, nervousness flickering across her features. The corner of her lips twitched as she struggled with the question she felt compelled to ask.

Fingers twiddling, she finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, <font color = white>&#34;Is it true someone was beheaded?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) I nod my head. <font color = white>&#34;I wasnt there thankfully, but I heard about it. It was pretty day but thats what criminals get.&#34;</font>

The cubby girl was tired herself but she was head to bed rather than waking up. She had a bit of time to spare though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was trying to forget everything that had happened the day before, but the moment someone brought it up all the bad memories came flooding her at once, emotionally overwhelming her. The girl put her hand on her stomach while avoiding looking at anyone, her gaze fixated on the water in front of her.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, they executed a prisoner and made us watch, but that wasn&#39;t the worst part. It was right before that when things got ugly. It still makes me feel sick thinking about it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah... It was a bit more than just a beheading...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) yawned into her palm <font color = white>&#34;That is so. Such acts will keep us safe, as I was explaining to Hideo here.&#34;</font> she gave the boy a wink. As if they shared some secret. 

<font color = white>&#34;I have considered taking up the practice myself. If we behead anyone who faces us then noone will question Iwagakure when we step outside our walls.&#34;</font> she yawned again and looked up at the sky.

<font color = white>&#34;About time I rest however....good day children.&#34;</font> she say and give them all a bow before making her way to a bench to snooze.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I am so close to getting a katana...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: How much more do you need?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Flame in the eyes, determination, etcetera. Not actual flames. No... you youngsters with elemental ninjutsu would be troublesome.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just three-hundred left.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: C'mere Fubuki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked up to Hideo. <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (also i gotta run an errand and will brb for 15 mins)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) reaches into his pocket and produces a very crumpled wad of, what was probably, three-hundred ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Here, get a super cool sword.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at the wad of money and immediately shaked her head while waving her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;No, you don&#39;t need to do it really! I appeciate it but like, it&#39;s a lot.&#34;</font> Fubuki spoke quickly due to being flustered, it was an unexpectedly cool moment from Hideo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and gestures with the money again,

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, spending money makes me happy.&#34;</font>

Lowering the money slightly he smiles. How blessed was he that getting money was his primary goal solely because spending it made him happier... He, however, does not miss an opportunity to be slightly snide,

<font color = white>&#34;Even though you&#39;re sometimes mean and lame. You <i>do</i> need a sword so you can actually fight and stuff. All I need is my dad to stop being lazy and teach me jutsu.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Aw, Hideo's being noble.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm always noble!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched her head while thinking about it, she couldn&#39;t even jokingly bully him. So many people had already helped her and she couldn&#39;t help people back. Eventually she caved in and sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay fine. I accept it if you insist. But for my next katana I&#39;ll try to make the money on my own -- and if you need ANY help, you ask me. You got that?&#34;</font>

She stepped forward and put her hands on her hips, looking at him seemingly upset though her face betrayed her intentions, which were just being serious about her promise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (GRAHHH)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) nods his head and hands her the money, <font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;m immediately calling in my favor; be less mean to me.&#34;</font>

With that handled, he spins to face the old man. Using his still out-stretched hand, now freed of money, to point at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I totally heard you say us having elemental jutsu would be &#39;troublesome&#39;! I&#39;m gonna learn to throw fireballs <b>and</b> mountains and it&#39;ll be the complete opposite of troublesome! It&#39;ll be... helpful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately nodded and grabbed the money, putting it alongside her stash. Just enough for the katana she had ordered.

<font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;ll only be mean if you&#39;re mean to me though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Damn, I guess that's fair.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I appreciate the donation but I won't become a punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have my word I won't start shit though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I would never treat you like one! I'm usually the punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Heh, true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Trust me man I may laugh and smile but it tooootallly sucks most of the time.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If it makes you feel better, I was always joking. Sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, I figured. Thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think Tsuneko may be the only one that actually means it... I 'unno.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nah, she's messing with you too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I don't think anyone actually hates anyone else here.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hrm, I hope so.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) rested his good eye on Hideo while the other glances at Fubuki. He&#39;d let out a troubled sigh as he thought about his days of fighting against ninjutsu.

<font color = white>&#34;Helpful how?&#34;</font>, he questioned as he removed a glass from his sleeve and quickly took a sip.

<font color = white>&#34;You youngsters are something else.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I 'unno I figure throwing mountains could probably help someone somehow. Lemmie get there first. I'll worry about what I do when I'm there, when I'm there!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, very true.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw the man look at them each with a separate eye and couldn&#39;t get that mental image out of her mind. It just might be more traumatizing than yesterday.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, what would be helpful then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Maybe someone will ask me to relocate a mountain range or something heroic like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like, literally carving a path through the mountains or something. That'd probably be super helpful.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Took much plate shifting with cause an earthquake.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'll make the earth stop moving, easy.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hey, I'd be the one carving through the mountains with my sword.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Swords.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fair. But I bet I could just like... rip chunks out of the mountain super easy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Carve a valley with my barehands...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like diggin' through sand at the beach...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) asks: My idea of being helpful is selfish. I would make sure I'd use ninjutsu to protect the crops and livestock! How could I sleep with a full stomach if there's no food?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah but that's like- obvious stuff! I thought wanted unique examples or something!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm a simple man.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: My way of being helpful will be cutting down anyone who attacks us.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) had a delusional smile on his face as he remembered the cheers of the crowds that gathered around him.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Ahh, yes...

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Mm, the small stuff is usually glanced over until those things are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh I guess that's true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I guess all the small stuff would probably be good training too right?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Damn right, if you're going to reach your -goal- then you're gonna have to leave no stone unturned.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think it might be literal stones when it comes to doton training.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, I see what you did there.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Say, Old Man Tooki, what kinds of stuff did you do when you were 'cleaning up the streets'?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was full of energy and brimming with taijutsu mastery.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was gaining experience left and right, finishing fights fast.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) swiftly sent two strikes Eastward. Loud pops from joints, muffled by cloth, bounced from off the mountains.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had only the vaguest understanding of taijutsu basics, if even that. So just seeing two punches performed was enough to convince him.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Woah, he actually does know stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: What a time it was to be alive... I think out of fifty, there's only been two farms that were too much to save.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Whoa really? What happened to them?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Too much ninjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: I was completely outclassed!

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I need ninjutsu...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: At that point, I think I reached the peak of taijutsu. Swiftness helped me avoid certain things to close in.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wonder how fast I have to throw a mountain for someone to be unable to just... avoid it with swiftness...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Depends on the person.

Then she&#39;d turn around and quickly fit the stick through the hole. She used no strength but if someone was truly peeping then she&#39;d be able to find out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: But this practice makes a weakness of mine a strength.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp, I&#39;m gettin&#39; in tha&#39; water.&#34;</font> the teen said. She decided to change inside, though. Folding her kimono and putting it away before returning in a towel.

The girl took a dip into the water, swimming around freely.

<font color = white>&#34;So who else is lookin&#39; forward to becomin&#39; a Genin?&#34;</font> she inquired.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) used her free hand to move one of her raven locks behind her ear before commenting.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: one day..il become a genin..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would lightly take off her boots..and long socks..as she rested them besides herself. She found herself sitting down and crossing her legs enjoying the waters warmth.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up to the Uchiha, monotone ever-present as he spoke.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) couldn&#39;t help but snicker at his remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Well that&#39;s one thing ya&#39; got in common. Can&#39;t fight ya&#39; on that.&#34;</font> she continued swimming about. <font color = white>&#34;But your personalities too. Both of ya&#39; talk in that same dull tone. Not much fer&#39; words and got an answer for anythin&#39;!&#34;</font> she said which was followed by more laughter.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) began to think once again, a dull matte finish overtaking his once glossy pupils.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) flipped another page. <font color = white>&#34;And you talk a lot for someone who has nothing to say.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Instead she wished she was in a river or ocean or something that flowed.

After hearing Ume speak she turned her gaze towards her. <font color = white>&#34;Heh, I got lots ta&#39; say. Ain&#39;t you been listenin&#39;? Juss&#39; from this conversation I met you an&#39; Bookworm #2. Learned about yer&#39; personalities and...&#34;</font> she paused, swimming a bit closer to the edge.

<font color = white>&#34;I decided. I like Raku more. He&#39;s a know-it-all but he&#39;s not as stuck-up.&#34;</font> she said with a wide grin. She knew Ume wouldn&#39;t care anyhow.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) nodded, and turned her page.

A newfound sense of distance formed between the hot springs, a place often overlooked but particularly busy today. It didn&#39;t matter to the quiet, frail boy.

He removed silky fabrics before walking out to the male area with a towel and shorts on. The reticent young boy slipped into the water, placing a palm onto the sand used for decoration. He would start practicing imbuing it with his Chakra.

After accomplishing that, he would shift it around without weaving a single seal.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Why was he on his underwear?

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Bow and arrow kind of bow, not the hair bow kind.  How much do bows cost?

The reticent young boy exhaled in a raspy tone, closing his eyes to concentrate on the chakra previously imbued into the sand.

<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Thank you for welcoming us into Iwagakure. Your village is much cleaner than Amegakure.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) turns to the old merchant.

<font color = white>&#34;This is...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) shifts his stance slightly at then mention of samurai, he still had to look into that.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) peers over his shoulder at the aloof aspirant for just a moment as if he were pinged.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) gestures to Asuno.

<font color = white>&#34;This young talent wanted to meet the head of your military for a business proposal.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) casually sat down in the chair after leading the group into the manor. A tired expression clearly present on her face.. Someday she&#39;d get her tea shipment.. Someday.

Looking up towards the group, she&#39;d listen along quietly as they introduced themselves and what they offered. Subtle nods are given in response as they speak.
 <font color = white>&#34;Greetings, Jungi, and Yuu.&#34;</font>, she&#39;d state with a more pleasant tone than her expression would suggest. <font color = white>&#34;I am Kitsumi of the Shingen clan.&#34;</font>

Giving a pause for Mugen to introduce himself, she continues on.
 <font color = white>&#34;Have you come today specifically to take orders from our aspiring Genin? Or is there something else as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would more so remain silent during this talk...seeming more serious than she usually was...similar to a few days ago..if one might recall..mm They stared on with a blank expression...while...

Just taking mental notes, she acted a fool for the students while they were around..but...probably not for important discussions like this...mm</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) glances to the side, his eyes falling on the duo, inviting them to speak their name. They seemed to be a pair, however he could not be certain.

His attention then given to the two men standing before them, nodding as they each introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Mugen, of the Utsuwa Clan and Iwagkaure Jounin.&#34;</font>,he said leaning onto his staff slightly, exuding and aura of confidence and stalwart strength.

<font color = white>&#34;Head of millitary affairs would be me and my compatriot, Kitsu&#39; &#34;</font>,he grinned.

<font color = white>&#34;You havent come to declare war on us now&#34;</font>?,he laughed to himself.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m joking...please tell us your proposal our crafters are not half as renowned as Akihbara&#39;s, we are all ears.&#34;</font>,he folded his arms awaiting their answer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) was calmly gazing at the back of the old man's head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) was drinking water until he almost spit&#39;s it out. He was a samurai in training. He was not ready for the smoke.<font color = white>&#34;Guh good one.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) uses Soichiro&#39;s shoulder for leverage and stands.
           <font color = white>&#34;Hi,&#34;</font> she says, chiming in where Junji left off.
<font color = white>&#34;...my name is Asuno, and I would like to play a tune for you all. I am thankful for your time here today.&#34;</font>

The youth retrieves the flute from her side and carefully inspects the golden pipe, a routine developed over time.
                      <font color = white>&#34;...this performance is called, &#39;Thank You For Your Attention.&#34;</font> 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1jJCH32OU] 

With a calm expression, the musician closes her eyes and places her soft lips upon the flute. As she exhales, a melody dances from the instrument, filling the room with light, metaphorical music notes. <font color = white>&#34;~..~...!&#34;</font>

The music stopped, and the girl bowed.
                <font color = white>&#34;I am here today to expand my art portfolio..&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I would love to sell my art dolls to the world but without proper models and influential figures, the brand will be unknown and a failure. No one will want a no-named doll in their collection.. and so I come here today, to meet the most popular and most influnetial shinobi in the land in order to craft a doll in their image.&#34;</font>

The blonde pulls out a doll, made from a Amegakure student. <font color = white>&#34;Here is an example.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (drop ur rp first old head
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) grunts after the musical performance, <font color = white>&#34;Well...ain&#39;t that something!&#34;</font> He her a head nod, 

<font color = white>&#34;Back to the topic at hand, &#34;</font> You&#39;ll find that we&#39;re all able to make weapons and armor but each of us is unique in our own way, thus we might all have a diffrent proposal for you to think over, still, even though we might have an individual purpose, the over-arching goal is the same, to secure an agreement between your villiage and Akihabara!&#34;</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) smiles, the music resonating with him, as his head swayed the tune easing any tension left in the room carrying it away with the melody. Mugen placed a hand on his chin as he continued to enjoy the proformance.

<font color = white>&#34;Bravo..thank you miss Asuno&#34;</font>,the jounin said giving a small round of applause, his head tilting to the side as she expained her reason for coming to iwagakure.

His smile which had already been plastered on his face, grew to stretch from <b>ear to ear.</b>

<font color = white>&#34;Ha&#34;</font>!,he exclaimed as he slammed his fist into the desk, the sound of the collision echoing through the large room.

<font color = white>&#34;My daughter wanted a doll of me, i was scrambling my brain thinking of how i would get her one, you lady Asuno are a life saver&#34;</font>!,the jounin declared, before clearing his throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahem- yes sorry...back to the topic as hand indeed.&#34;</font>,his full attention back on the old man.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Sorry about that!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (One sec lemme catch up
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) clapped her hands in appreciation.
    Watching a plan work to perfection was akin to completing a marthon. 

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s great. I wanted to show you a sample, but it looks like my doll was ripped in the process. Forgive me.&#34;</font>

The woman drips a hand into her backpocket. <font color = white>&#34;All I need from you is three angle shots and atleast a day&#39;s worth of time. The Akihabar Merchants can return to hand deliver your item...&#34;</font>

She pauses again, and looks around.
   <font color = white>&#34;..you are the most popular and influential shinobi in the land,&#34;</font> she says with a hint of doubt, brows risen. 
                      <font color = white>&#34;..right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: There are a couple of terms we Akihabara Merchants have.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) blinked a few times listening along quietly. This is where the dolls had come from? Well, at least it made sense now.

Letting out a sigh, she would begin speaking.
 <font color = white>&#34;Unfortunately we&#39;re a bit.. Lacking, in terms of &#39;famous&#39; Shinobi at the moment. Aside from the three of us here. Lord Tomoe, our Tsuchikage, has departed to your village along with an escort that consists of.. A large amount of our troops.&#34;</font>, she said with a nod.

Looking over the group that had come once again, she releases a small chuckle.
 <font color = white>&#34;Though, I suppose there&#39;s no harm in allowing you time to make your dolls. So long as the other merchants here are taking orders for our up-and-coming Genin.&#34;</font>

She directed her attention back towards the three in the center of the room.
 <font color = white>&#34;And to answer your question, yes. There are few more notable than Mugen and myself.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Narusari, Yuu(The old merchant-MyG) OOCs: (did my say get eatne?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Not for me)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) scrambles to her seat, <font color = white>&#34;Understood miss! Please direct me to whoever is available and fits the description! After the meeting of course. That&#39;s all I had.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [i see it!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: In the future, I believe it would wise to also employ the use of your shinobis when it comes to requiring protection for our caravans.
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: That could be arranged, though there would need to either be payment or an exchange of goods.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: We also require the ability to come into and exit your lands at our leisure, this ability would cover our escourts as well. We of course would submit to all of your rules and laws
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Rip Mugen)
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Mhm.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (-_-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) mulled over the thought for a moment. Allowing anyone free passage into the village was often something that took a long and tedious process to approve. However..
 <font color = white>&#34;Sure. So long as you submit to random luggage checks, just to ensure the safety of those inside.&#34;</font>, she said with a nod. <font color = white>&#34;Likely not everytime, and maybe never. But, it is the price for free access without needing someone escorting you around the village.&#34;</font>

As she finished, she leaned forward, placing her elbow on the desk and resting her head on her hand.
 <font color = white>&#34;Aside from that, you&#39;re merchants so allowing you access to deal with our forces is only beneficial.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) rubbed his chin.
<font color = white>&#34;Yes our Shinobi are more than capable..&#34;</font>,he noded.

<font color = white>&#34;There are security concerns and open border would incur yes, not long random inventory checks but we would have to supply limited seals or talismans only to be distributed to offical merchants of this trade agreement..&#34;</font>,the mans mind was working out all the issues with the deal, that could threaten the safety of his village.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (*not only 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) nods his head in agreement, <font color = white>&#34;We are nuetral in all manners, I assure you no Akihabara Merchant would knowingly allow his or her trade to be hijacked by anyone with ill intentions. Still, I understand to make sure we are doing what we say we are and nothing more.&#34;</font>

Yuu rests his other hand on his cane, <font color = white>&#34; I&#39;m old enough to have seen a war or two in my life time, nasty bussiness!&#34;</font>

Yuu shakes his head, <font color = white>&#34; We request that we be left out of all wars concerning you and your allies and enemies, bussiness must go on, if a Akihabara merchant is caught between you and and enemy, we request that our merchants not be harmed in the conflict so long as they do not attempt to interfere in the fight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) twirled his fishing pole while the old man was talking and he realized he would have to get stronger soon. The world as he knew was not safe.<font color = white>&#34;If war happen&#39;s I have to prepare my survival guide. Don&#39;t worry old man. Once I complete my training it&#39;s up for evil doers!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nodded along in agreement. Merchants were akin to civilians, just people looking to make a living off of their trade. There was often little reason, or tactical benefit, in harming a civilian-- Let alone one that also benefitted everyone.

Turning towards Mugen for a moment, she&#39;d nod a single time before shifting back towards Yuu.
 <font color = white>&#34;That is fine. As long as the village of Akihabara remains neutral in any and all conflicts, then they will be guaranteed safety from the forces of Iwagakure.&#34;</font>, she&#39;d state flatly, pausing for a moment after. <font color = white>&#34;However.&#34;</font>

She sat back up, placing both hands on the table in front of her. It was rare, if ever, to see the Shingen Jonin speak in a serious tone or even give much thought and care to what she was doing. The one thing she would never slack on, though, was the safety of those around her. Their Tsuchikage being a shining star of an example that she wished to follow.
 <font color = white>&#34;If at any point that neutrality is broken, there will be consequences to pay and the village will be seen as an enemy. As well, if there are any conflicts within our borders, your merchants are to bring it up to either Mugen or myself, should Lady Tomoe not be around. Any hostility will void all neutrality views.&#34;</font>

She paused for a moment again.
 <font color = white>&#34;This doesn&#39;t mean our Shinobi will bring harm to any of you, and if anyone tries unprovoked I will handle it personally.&#34;</font>, she vented a sigh, leaning back into her chair. <font color = white>&#34;Is this clear?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) need not say anything, only letting the weight of his chakra press down on the merchants and the seriousness of his aura speak for him. The jounin nodding towards his partner a sign of his full support and backing of her statement.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Reasonable
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) offered a smile and thumbs up.
 <font color = white>&#34;Cool!&#34;</font>, her youth shining through. <font color = white>&#34;All is good then, yeah?&#34;</font>

She stretched herself out, pushing against the chair to lean back on two legs as she did.
 <font color = white>&#34;Whew! Meetings suck.&#34;</font>, she continued, a small <i>thud</i> echoing out as she stopped stretching. <font color = white>&#34;Is there anything else?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would form a reassuring small smile.as she formed a unsure look before raising a hand to cover her mouth. Coughing a bit....

T-that was..sudden...but then she heared something about meetings sucking and she spoke there after. <font color = white>&#34;definately..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;Do you all make Tonfas?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Am I forgetting anything?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Oh, let me get those photos and we can go back home!
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: ..and that guy wants Sofas.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Tonfa? That's doable.
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'd like to make an order.
