He&#39;d take another deep breath as he threw a jab into the air and crossed it with a punch into the air.

<font color = white>&#34;Can&#39;t stop training!&#34;</font>

Confidence oozed off of him as he stood proudly as if he was besting an invisible enemy infront of him. The small flames from the nearby bonfire created a shadow onto the wall next to him as he continued to throw punches and kicks into the air, shadow boxing himself for a few more intense seconds until he quickly dropped to the  floor, doing a few burpees before standing back up and throwing more punches into the air. A sense of power and pride was all that overcame him as he continued his workout. He used the back of his hand to wipe his brow until dropped down and started to do crunches.

Every last fiber of his being was under immense stress, but.. It was something she was had to work on being able to handle with more training. Within him flowed the power of determination. Being for a family without any bloodline prowess or kekkei genkai he was going to have to work hard in order to stand up to the those who would oppose him in the future and for his own survivability.

He&#39;d swith to doing push ups in quick succession, heavy pants escape him as the massive drain on his body began to finally take a toll for his lack of stamina. However, he refused to allow himself to fall. His arms drove into the ground, as he started to push toward his upward limit. Each push up became progressively harder.

After a few more passing moments, he collapsed to his elbows, panting heavily as thick beads of sweat fall from his brow and coated the snow beneath him. A chuckle escaped him, followed by a hearty laugh. He&#39;d roll onto his back as a mist of breath in the cold air escaped his lips and he gazed up into the sky.</font></font></font>
