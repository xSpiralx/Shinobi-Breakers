<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) pulled out a fish of her own as she stared towards it. She&#39;d take a few seconds of simply gazing at the fish before starting to copy the teacher as she devoured it all bar the bone which would be deposited into a nearby trashcan.

However astute eyes would notice that whilst the fish she had taken out was raw, every bite would be charred and mostly cooked as they entired her mouth. The Hyuugas would clearly notice her pumping katon attuned chakra into the fish to flashcook it.

<font color = white>&#34;Now I&#39;m a real woman, like sensei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: I heard that, y'know?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yawns while trotting down the road.
He glances over to Kamiya, standing next to his sister.

<font color = white>&#34;You.&#34;</font> He scowls ot the both of them, though mostly to Kamiya for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: You looked at her weirdly. I didn't appriecate that.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) giggled at Sakuya&#39;s words. She approached Hajime and drew her nails down her cheeks, drawing blood--

And then, Shun&#39;ichi appeared.

<font color = white>&#34;What?&#34;</font> She spat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: A true women it's it whole I've been told.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) paused. 

Her limited attention span was drawn to the events taking place nearby. Aversion, repulsion, and every sickened emotion in between creased and wrinkled her face, watching someone eat a fish of all things in such a animalistic manner!

<font color = white>&#34;Gross. Fish are gross! Don&#39;t you know where that thing&#39;s been, Maya?!&#34;</font>
She waved her arms frantically in protest!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares.

His eyes widen upon seeing the illogical behavior of Kamiya, who draws blood with her own nails. 

<font color = white>&#34;Umm... Kamiya, does that not hurt...?&#34;</font> He asks, though the sheer display has him weirded out, incredibly so.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held out a single seal, disappearing.

<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you hanging around that thing, sis?&#34;</font> He initiates.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) looks to Maya as a fish was withdrawn from somewhere and stared at, <font color = white>&#34;Wait, that&#39;s not good for you--&#34;</font> The Hyuuga grimaced as the Gorumba&#39;s mouth opened to chow down - only to relax all of a sudden and exhale. All tension flows away, like that ryo bill in the river would have if not &#39;saved&#39; by Hanako.

She was puffing flames to cook it at the very last second... Scary, but... Not as poisonous as it could have been. The fish probably had scales and everything though, gross.

<font color = white>&#34;...I think fish isn&#39;t for me anymore.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) removed a napkin from her pouch as she began to delicately dab at her lips in order to clean them of any fishy debris before turning her attention towards Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;This river, I caught it myself...&#34;</font>

A simple answer to a straight forward questio as her head cocked to the side in a curious manner.

<font color = white>&#34;And it&#39;s a fresh as it comes, orphans can&#39;t be picky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) swiped her eyes over at Hajime. The cuts aren&#39;t particularly deep, but she bled softly from the rake all the same. It doesn&#39;t take long for it to roll down to her jawline, and then drip to the cobblestone beneath.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course it hurts.&#34;</font> She replied, before moving to face the ugly, green-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m going to hurt you really badly.&#34;</font> She promised to Shun&#39;ichi.</font></font></font>

It was indeed a pin bone that she had swallowed, a sharp end had lodged itself within the base of her esophagus and needed to be dislodged.

However she was too weak to dislodge it herself, causing each weak dull thump to just cause her to choke loudly.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I knew it! She&#39;s choking, I&#39;ll get it out,&#34;</font> she claimed before reaching to still Maya from Hanako in order to pull her upright, <font color = white>&#34;Let me.&#34;</font> She straightens a hand out into a palm...

He had seen it happen before..! 

<font color = white>&#34;No pain, no gain..&#34;</font>

After garnering the necessary momentum, the young orphan jumps onto Maya&#39;s stomach to deliver a drop kick with the force of gravity behind it, performing the most violent heimlich maneuver possible..!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got you..!&#34;</font>

The fact that the Hyuuga was trying to save her had ignited his competitive spirit, and he wished to do so, instead. </font></font></font>

A saviour who knew what was wrong, her attempted murder by drowning was adverted for now as the strike PERFECTLY dislodged the bone as it ejected from her mouth with speed, flying through the air in a perfect arc before landing innocently on the ground in front of them.

A gasp of air entered her lungs as she began to violently cough for a few seconds.

<font color = white>&#34;T-Thanks... damn fish bone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Are you sure? You ate pavement really hard!

His eyes were spinning, though. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) released him, if only because he insisted he was fine. 

<font color = white>&#34;Untrue! Shopkeeps don&#39;t mind when the ryo&#39;s a little soggy! They just.. narrow their eyes and stare at you a lot. It&#39;s probably because the sogginess makes the numbers harder to read?&#34;</font> She shrugs! A hand came down, offering to yank him to his feet. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would watch the Senju and Kaguya both strike the bastard child of a Senju, he was doomed. Though, the one being struck was being a jerk. He honestly didn&#39;t care if it didn&#39;t escalate further than it had, and all the while another girl was saved from a fish bone.

<font color = white>&#34;And the day was saved, thanks to the Hyuuga.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) An overbearingly smug grin hooked upon the corners of the Hyuuga&#39;s lips and tugged wider as she witnessed her perfect strike dislodge the fish bone straight from the source. It surprised her a little, but she would never admit that. As far as anyone else knew, this was planned and she was the most skilled academy student.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahaha! You&#39;re welcome. Nothing comes close to my clan&#39;s techniques after all,&#34;</font> she proclaimed, side-eyeing Hajime after he had failed to compete and was now being dragged off to heal underwater. Or attempted to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) The backhand, caught him off-guard! The Senju sibling was definitely quicker than the Kedoiin, which forces him to bite on his tongue fiercely. <font color = white>&#34;Owhhhhh! Sahu--&#34;</font> Followed by Kamiya&#39;s own violent outburst, though, he wouldn&#39;t give the girl the satisfaction of hitting him.

Blocking the girl&#39;s attack, he continues to whine with a damaged tongue, <font color = white>&#34;Buh, Kahiha sarhed i&#39; &#39;he ot&#39;er deh!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) accepts the yank!

He rises to his feet with her aid, a tad wobbly. He threatens to wobble in all four cardinal directions and fall again, due to the previous impact.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow. Can you guys stop spinning, please?..&#34;</font> He requests, before side-eyeing the spinning Hanako as well, with a faint flash of spite.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Hinoue.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Could I speak with you in private?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) relentlessly attacked, delivering another kick. He seemed to think this was some sort of game--

It was not, as the blood poured from her own rakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) noticed Hajime&#39;s unsteadiness.

A swirl that carried him east, north, west, south! Hm! Clearly the remedy for such things was to spin him in the opposite direction, as to unwind the factors that made him dizzy in the first place! So! She grasped him by the shoulders and spun him clockwise, akin to a kid being prepared for their turn at a pinata. 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s okay! I&#39;ll just.. unspin you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I'm a medical professional. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) was not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) arched a brow inquisitively as the veiny protrusions spreading from those fainty lavender orbs would gradually soften and lose their prominence - no longer visible against skin. She wondered what could have prompted this request, but she doubts it was anything bad after witnessing her greatness just now.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... Alright, sure,&#34;</font> she obliged, <font color = white>&#34;Lead the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Oh no.

<font color = white>&#34;W-wait..! Unspin..? Wah..!&#34;</font>

The unspinning has the opposite effect and he finds himself teetering even more, until he threatens to collapse right onto Hanako..! A hand rises to cover his mouth, as well.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) recognized that shade of green. Why-- that&#39;s the same shade of green she took on mere moments ago, watching Maya chomp on raw fish! She frantically circled him, intent on escaping his potential spew range!

<font color = white>&#34;Ack, abort, abandon mission! It didn&#39;t work! It didn&#39;t work!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) pulled a chair out of her pocket and took a seat on the bridge to watch the commotions until something else happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Seeing that the situation has escalated beyond any hope of peaceful resolution, Sakuya joins Kamiya in taking decisive action against Shun&#39;Ichi. She launches into a coordinated assault, seamlessly blending their movements into a relentless series of kicks and stomps. What unfolds could be likened to what is widely known as <font color = white>&#34;being jumped,&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) collapses to the ground, and though he keeps his mouth covered for a few moments, he soon breathes a sigh of relief.

He had avoided death itself. Or the death of his self-image for the foreseeable future.

Only after a few moments, does he tilt his head backwards while lying on the ground to finally realize that the fight was still ongoing.

<font color = white>&#34;W-woah... They&#39;re jumping that kid... &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hm??
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Nah, they're just helping him out. Probably. He's clearly choking.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) passes off the fish.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: No, no... They're stomping him out...
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Hm? Just a normal day at the orphanage... kids have to be strong enough to protect themselves.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Like, when you talk back against the big kid in the orphanage..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: H-hey..! Cease this stompening!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) received a bunch of fish. She released them back to their natural habitat. 

They lifelessly float away on the current, dumped back into the river. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Goodbye, fish. Go back to peeing in the ocean, as Kami intended.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Class time...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: In a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I wonder what will be thrown at us today..
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) felt a twinge of audacious spite creep up on his shoulders. To which he&#39;s forced to answer with his own deftness.
First order of business, getting away from Kamiya--she&#39;s the stronger one of the two, if his memory serves him correctly, so getting away from her would prove advantageous, forcing him to only deal with Sakuya.

He&#39;s never won a fight against her, though today&#39;s the day he might be given the chance to try.
Kamiya is evaded this time, with Sakuya being blocked. He uses Sakuya&#39;s weight to bounce away from the dynamic duo and more toward the riverbanks. The bell sounds, however, he knows the kids won&#39;t relent; and he doesn&#39;t plan on doing so either.
<font color = white>&#34;Coh&#39; aht meh... Bich&#39;s.&#34;</font> He states, as long as Kamiya&#39;s interrupted by Sakuya, he&#39;s safe, somewhat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Hey, hey! Two on one isn't fair..!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) delivers the line that had gotten him stomped out at the orphanage many times.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) was on his ass. Was she lying about him being faster? It seemed like it...

Just as a punch is about to be thrown to his cranium, though, the dancer twisted her body away and cartwheeled to a standing position.

<font color = white>&#34;I head the academy bell. You&#39;re lucky.&#34;</font> she said, to the fat-tongued boy. <font color = white>&#34;You will apologize to me after class or you&#39;re going to keep getting this.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t a very hard demand to meet, luckily for him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya stopped her assualt. It was time for class.

<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be inconviencing us like this Shun.&#34;</font> She shrugs as she readies herself to leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) breathes a sigh of relief once he sees that yet another stomping had been averted..! No doubt thanks to his efforts, as he had told them that stomping was wrong, and to cease. Clearly, this was a victory for him.

He rises to his feet after a few moments, still a bit wobbly, but he smiles regardless.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;all wanna&#39; head to that lesson?&#34;</font> He asks, before his gaze focuses upon the one referred to as Shun.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, man! You alright?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, shoot. I'm gonna be late! 
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: You're gonna be early.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: It's okay to be a little early, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. wait. I still haven't turned in my application. I can't be late.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Turn it in..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm safe.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No! I like the immunity! 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: You wanna' be immune to graduation, too?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: If I turn it in, they'll start keeping my lateness on record--
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. I'll turn it in the day before I graduate.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's the perfect crime.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Huh. Smart...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Nope!
