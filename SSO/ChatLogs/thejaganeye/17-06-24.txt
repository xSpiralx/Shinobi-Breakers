<font color = white>&#34;Oh, thanks for the heads up.&#34;</font>
They said, resting a hand on the shoes he had stolen from the boy as it seemed the blame got shifted to one of the Shark clan.
<font color = white>&#34;When i see them i&#39;ll ask them about your shoes&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stuck his hands behind his head, frowning. <font color = white>&#34;Nah, it&#39;s okay. Shoes come and go. Those were just special. One of a kind, in fact. I can&#39;t fault them for it. Probably thought it was a fish... I&#39;ll get them back someday.&#34;</font>

He pushed a rock with his foot. <font color = white>&#34;If you see them though, let me know. I&#39;ll make sure to go easy on you if we ever spar.&#34;</font> He cracked a small smile. <font color = white>&#34;Maybe when my hand&#39;s better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

The boy could remember how much his father&#39;s rage when he lost a round in blackjack, and how frequently he went out drink to cope with his failed winnings. 

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, sorry... I try to steer aware from anything that feels like gambling&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;How about a game of hidden?&#34;</font> Where someone counts and everyone hides.&#34;
he suggested after releasing his chin as his hand fell down to his side.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Too easy for me.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: My name is Hoshigaki, Onisame.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Hopefully we can get placed in the same class. "Onisame, I'm Kryu of the Hozuki clan."
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Would be nice to have someone to train alongside.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: Aye.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) asks: Hozuki.. Your clan also uses water, doesn't it?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Mhm, thats right
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: What do you want?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) asks: Is there anything to want from you, old guy?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your tongue is sharp but your teeth are not. You will be made example.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) folds his arms, appearing rather sheepish once his developmental flaw had been pointed out. The prepubescent sharkling looks down.

<font color = white>&#34;H-hey.. My teeth are still growing. You don&#39;t need to tell everyone else about that..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) takes a few steps closer to the blue-skinned boy. A blur is made before the sound of a thunderous smack occurs.
The boy had been slapped by speeds far greater than they could perceive.

<font color = white>&#34;<i>Silence.</i>&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) feels the sting of a thunderous slap echo across his face. Its sheer speed sends the preteen unconscious before he could process what happened!

All of this, just for greeting his superior... Was this, the feeling of discrimination against the blue-skinned folk?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You are learning.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You do not address me as old guy.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You call me Commander.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: Nngh...
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If you understand then nod.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) opens half an eye lid. It just barely fixes his vision onto the Uzumaki. 
  <i><font color = white>&#34;C-Commander..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) looked upwards from the ground. His head moving as slightly as it could.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Come with me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) takes some time to get up to his two feet. He silently follows behind his superior.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) gestures a hand toward the blue-skinned boy. <font color = white>&#34;Beat him. You may take his shoes too.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) yells: ...?!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) looked confused as he manage to fall into a daze. <font color = white>&#34;Oh no this time of day the current isn&#39;t strung.&#34;</font> he replied.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) diverts her attention from the now shoeless reserved youth. Her eyes rest on the blue-skinned boy, primarily towards the shoes he adorns.

     <font color = white>&#34;..You ready?&#34;</font> she inquires.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) jumped up to face the stature of the crimson-haired vet and gave a salute. <font color = white>&#34;Eh... good day sir!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good day. You may refer to me as Commander. Nothing else.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) sprinted forward towards the hoshigaki while launching a senbon toothpick in his direction. Hopefully it was enough to throw him off-guard as he begun his assault.

Advancing on the hoshigaki&#39;s position he&#39;d bellow, <font color = white>&#34;Just give use the shoe and we can end this...what size are you?&#34;</font>

Another toothpick was fired at the hosigaki&#39;s ankles. If he was lucky it would strike him in the bunions.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice, looking between his friend to his cousin. A crazy predicament. Though, she looked to not be inclined to join the scuffle - so he saw little to really <i>do</i>.

Though, this kid beating on his cousin gave him a sour taste in his mouth. With that at the least - he felt as if it was on his shoulders to at least try to deter this. His poncho being unlatched, Jinbeisame sighed, his mouth opening to speak, <font color = white>&#34;D&#39;you need help handling that little one?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She gives her friend&#39;s glance a returned side-eye, though a smile quickly flashes onto her face.

     <font color = white>&#34;He should be fine! If he wins, then I&#39;ll probably have to do something. If not, well..&#34;</font> As per usual?

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: That little.. That just means he tried ignoring me earlier!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: You've gotta show me where!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sure, he should still be over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) continued with his pursuit with the intent of closing the distance. It wasn't like he wanted to engage in combat. Infact it was under the order of the jounin to collect the shoes. However anyone absent when the order was given would have lost the contexts of the fiasco. 

Sprinting forward in sporactic manner, another flick of the wrist had sent another toothpick forward. If only he'd learn some suiton jutsu... maybe then he'd be able to bring this foolish chance to an end.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) waves towards the two stationary ones further back. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got this,&#34;</font> replies the preteen sharkling to Jinbeisame.

Once again, he side steps the incoming projectiles while in motion towards the water. Instead of hitting his ankles, they touch the ground. <font color = white>&#34;Hozuki boy. Lay off me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Are you running?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) would have moved even closer to the water, dodging yet another toothpick, by the time the call to cease would surface.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) yells: Oyi!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) assumed the position of attention and gazed at the jounin commander and formed a salute. Pausing in his tracks as a dust cloud trailed behind him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) shakes his head. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not running.&#34;</font> The boy dives into the water nearby. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m swimming.&#34;</font>

He hesitates no further, sinking to depths only his kind would reach before any further commands bellowed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) looks between the both of them. 

Oh. The shark-kin is swimming away. The Commander smirks.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Oyi!&#34;</font>

The pursuit after the hoshigaki would die down as he faded into the distance and depths of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Sir may I make a request of either a kunai or senbon?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
