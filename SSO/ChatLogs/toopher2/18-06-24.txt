<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) asks: Could you please point me out the direction to the village's academy?
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: I uh.... have no idea I'm afraid! I'm looking around for it myself, bit bad at directions tehe!
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) asks: Cool. Want to look for it together?

As the words 'scissors' left her mouth, her hand slammed opened showcasing the fact that she went with... ROCK!

But, would the other person have gone on 'scissors' or would they have said go?!? Most importantly-- did she win?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#333333>Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) would never dare to fail in such a challenge. It&#39;d take all of his willpower -- trying to figure out which card the black haired teen would bring up to the fight, a overwhelming task for him, considering how little he knew about her.

Yet, time was running low and he had nowhere else to go. He wasn&#39;t so sure about his analysis, but that one whom he talked about reminded him of a scissor the most --- delligent and head-on, yet flexible.

With that, he&#39;d bring the power of rock to bring misery to the one he aimed to defeat. He&#39;d call forth his moving with a battlecry:

    <font color = white>&#34; ---- ROCK!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) asks: I guess we go north?
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: Alright, sounds fair.
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: That settles it, then.
<br><font color=teal>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) thinks: Did he go on go, or scissors?!? I was too excited!

<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Well... there's only one way too tell!
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) asks: It has to be right?
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) asks: Did we make it?
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Look at all of these just lying around. It has to be the academy!
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: I mean --- look at those scrolls. YEAH! I was thinking the same.
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) asks: Unless... it's a trick? Maybe this is a fake academy! After all, where is everyone?
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: That is fair. If it were an academy, there'd be a lot of people running around.
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: Let's go deeper into the building. Perhaps they're hiding from us?!
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Maybe it's a double tra- yeah exactly!
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) asks: Surely they wouldn't use so many scrolls for a fake?
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) asks: ...Or would they?
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: Maybe...
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: I say we go deeper.

<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) asks: Perhaps it *is* a real academy?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) her eyes continued to dart too and fro, ocasionally glancing back to make sure the youngster with her was still okay.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: Let's move like this.
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: Yeah! One step at a time.
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: Right.
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) asks: Ready?
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: On your move!
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Be careful!
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: Sorry! Too many places to keep an eye on.
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) asks: You ready for the stairs?
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: We are almost there!
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: No one following us so far --- climb it!

At last, the duo reached for the first man they managed to find inside the building. Atkin's senses grew weary, breaking the back-to-back formation with the black haired teen so the two of them had the Amegakure's Executioner as their target.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shanin(The black haired teen-Toopher2) OOCs: (Someone's gonna get a chuckle out of seeing two smooth brain scenes into that LOOC)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) blinks a bit, tilting his head to the side. His body was hidden behind multiple layers of clothing. It was hard to tell exactly everything he had on, and the mask....the mask in which covered his very face. Not even eyes could be seen through the very slits. However, they would hear a deep growl, followed by a deep sigh. When speaking, a rich but dark and deep voice would protrude from the mask. Albeit, it almost sounded hollow due to what he had covering his face.

<font color = white>&#34;This is not the Academy. You&#39;ve stumbled upon the Kage Mansion, hence the Kage Manor you have trespassed into....&#34;</font>

He would state, before looking towards the two.

<font color = white>&#34;Trap? I am not here to harm any of my forces, rather oversee their growth within the first year.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: .................
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) would look towards her new friends with panic shining through her eyes... before doing the only logical thing after finding out you had trespassed on the Kage&#39;s manor...

&lt;b&gt; BANG! &lt;/b&gt; Her knees hit the flooring tears in her eyes. <font color = white>&#34;Please don&#39;t disbar him from the academy it was an accedint! It was my fault, I braught it being a fake academy first, and how it was suspicious, so I goaded him into going further! Y-you can disbar me instead!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shanin(The black haired teen-Toopher2) OOCs: (sadge)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#333333>Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) felt the world falling upon him, as the MINUSCULE chance that that very man was one of the guards of the Kage Manor, and the two had had the brightest idea of invading it uninvited --- were the two of them to be taken as a menace by the man?

Atkin would bring his face back to the black haired teen, cursing that very rock-paper-scissors game that got themselves there.

   <font color = white>&#34; --- CURSE YOU, NORTH!&#34;</font>, he said so while facing his partner in crime.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Amegakure's Executioner(The executioner-CConlin216) OOCs: (Alright, reading now. Had to set up profile.
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: NO! We are both guilty!
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: B-bu-
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: Only if... I had paid more attention to our backs!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) although she didn&#39;t stop kneeling, and the tears kept bubbling in her eyes, a small happy smile appeared on her face before falling. <font color = white>&#34;No - no! I was the one who thought we should continue after thinking it was a trap.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: ARGH! Only if we had gone south instead.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) would listen to the two, before tilting his head to the side. He found the duo to be quite whimsical and even...ammusing. He would head over into another room, before grabbing out his papers. Looking through the roster of the Village, before pulling out their Shinobi Records. His voice, still coming through as that dark, deep but rich hollow tone that they could both so clearly hear.

<font color = white>&#34;Atkin....and Shanin. Students of Amegakure?&#34;</font> He would question, before continuing on.

<font color = white>&#34;Neither of you are going to be punished. I could give a flying fuck that you have stumbled in here on accident, or on purpose. What I need you to do, is only one rather simple thing.&#34;</font> He would say, before pausing for ever but a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;What is it you wish to accomplish in your life as Shinobi? What is it, you seek to become upon your journey to that of being Capable Genin in my Military Force?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) the tears shined even harder in her eyes as the man said they wouldn&#39;t be punished - but they did not fall! <font color = white>&#34;I enrolled because I was told I have lots of chakra sir... so I wish to become a strong Ninjutsu using shinobi so that I can protect Amegakure, my friends, and comrades! I want to grow strong enough that my friends don&#39;t have to look out for my back in fear, and instead stand side by side me... sir!&#34;</font>

All the while she was still kneeling on the floor, a guilty look slowly fading on her face as she grew more and more impassioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) increases their chakra by Full - 9 / 9.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#333333>Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) grew amazed by the forgiving nature of that very man. To think that they&#39;d invade the kage&#39;s manor and leave with every single limb that they first came with? Crazy!

After hearing that they weren&#39;t doomed, Atkin would bring his face to Shanin once again, showing off the biggest smile he&#39;s achieved to this day.

It didn&#39;t take long until Atkin came to his regular self, confronted by the question directed at him and his partner. After all, they were only looking for the academy to begin with.

   <font color = white>&#34; --- Very much, sir! The two of us were looking for a way inside the academy, but it seems we have strayed from the right path. Please, do guide us onto the right way!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: I fear I don't have such a perk as hers, but I will provide to them on my on way! I have been studying really hard ever since, and my creativity, historical knowledge and logical thinking shoukld be crucial in the battlefield.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Atkin(The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) OOCs: (I will provide to the team*

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) would look towards Shanin as she spoke, nodding as he heard her telling him about how she had some great reserves that were to be noted. As well as the fact she wished to become some type of Ninjutsu Specailist. As for Atkin, when he spoke, his visage would focus on him. The masked man waiting and staying quietly to let the duo speak.  It had seemed one of them was...smarter than your average shinobi. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hm...very well. Since you both answered my questions with pure honesty and integrity, one shall forgive this little mishaps of stumbling within my room.&#34;</font>

He would nod, before moving closer towards the two, his dark deep voice turning that to nothing but a whisper.

<font color = white>&#34;The next time it happens though, you will be unable to train due to being in a coma for a weel. Do we have an understanding?&#34;</font>

He would question, if they both nodded yes, he would simply proceed to show them to the Academy.

<font color = white>&#34;As for our meeting of today, forgive me for being absent within the first couple of days. I was out of our village, handling some important matters.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Yes sir! Thank you sir!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) Would hurriedly stand up.</font></font></font>

<i>Swoosh, thud... thud...</i>

The set of wooden Shuriken succesfully imbed themselves into Higane's right shoulder, left leg and right arm.

Not a single sound exits her mouth.

He would then change from a flat open palm to more of a gripping hand gesture. Those around him would see for just an instant each individual finger light up purple. The second after, the palm was slammed against the boy's stomach, sealing his chakra usage.

Before making his way to the Central Point of the Village and finally, heading up the staircase, right to the Academy. Once there, he would turn around and look at both Atkin and Shanin.

<font color = white>&#34;This is where our Academy is located. I hope you both remember our little arrangement and keep it in mind. I look forward to checking up on your progress of training soon. Don&#39;t let me down Atkin, Shanin, alright?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Should he notice Shanin not bowing at the man, he&#39;d push her back to it. He couldn&#39;t risk the Amegakure&#39;s Executioner&#39;s changing his mind.
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) would bow towards the man instead of doing a kneel this time.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) asks: Who is the person that we should seek for to get to train?
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: I don't even play the guitar, by the way.
<br><font color=red>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) nods towards the two. Before looking towards Atkin.

<font color = white>&#34;You can seek out the Jounins, or even the Chuunins. However, I hear The Commander; an Uzumaki looking Veteran is in the process of training anyone that wishes to seek it. Show whoever you go to, the utmost respect and follow their methods, whatever they may be.

Failure to do so, is a failure to learn how you are going to deal with me when I handle your trainings and send you on missions.

Am I being clear enough?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Sir, yes, sir!
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: UNDERSTOOD!
<br><font color=green>*Amegakure's Executioner (The executioner-CConlin216) says: Now, I am going to leave you two at it. If you need anything, you know where I will be.
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: Right! 
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Yes sir!
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) says: Yeah... what a first day.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at  Higane,and how they took all these wounds for their clan head

<font color = white>&#34;Higane,snap out of this.please.&#34;</font>He will say,with most likely 0 chance they to be heard,afterall,they seemed to be controlled by something,somehow.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) would lean in and whisper slightly. <font color = white>&#34;I.... really hope the first thing we do isn&#39;t hand to hand combat.

<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) yells: Whatever it is, you'll manage through. Said that, I'm actually the bookworm myself. ARGH!
<br><font color=green>*Atkin (The pale, frenzy youngster-Hadouki1) asks: Anyway --- I happened to catch your name by that man's mouth. Shanin, was it?

<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: Right, nice to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) asks: Should we... go down?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) was looking forward, but her peripheral vision was still locked onto the Commander.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: What's going on?

Ethereal golden chains materialize and shoot to keenly coil around Sogeki, the black-haired boy, and the stern boy.

They are held high into the air.

<font color = white>&#34;A mess. My soldiers will know order.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: ..An incident happened earlier..

Looking at the massive group gathered. He would contnue downwards, til he was standing at the base of the lightpost as well. Next to the apparent grandson of a true hero.

A muffled <i>clink, clank</i>

Parts of her black kimono have small torn pieces which expose the skin.. Small trails of blood drip down the three points of injury.

The young Hyuuga, quietly looks around, seemingly assessing the situation once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn.. chains..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Higane...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) descended gracefully towards the ground, the rush of air and the exhilaration of movement surrounding him. His keen senses and eagle-like eyesight allowed him to anticipate every detail, every motion around him, as if time slowed down. With precision honed through rigorous training, he prepared to land.

Just as he was about to touch down, an unexpected surge of chakra-infused chains wrapped around his limbs with startling force. His descent halted abruptly, twisting his body mid-air. Sogeki's eyes widened in surprise as he realized he was suddenly restrained, suspended in the air by unseen forces.

The chains held him firmly in place, suspending him above the ground. Sogeki's muscles tensed instinctively, his mind racing to comprehend the situation. Frustration and defiance welled up within him, yet he knew resisting now would only escalate the confrontation further.

Caught in the grip of the chakra chains, Sogeki's breaths came quick and controlled. He grappled with a mix of emotions—frustration at being restrained, respect for the Commander's authority, and a burgeoning sense of understanding the consequences of his actions.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) was plucked mid punch from his trajectory and hoisted into the air. He was far from pleased. He struggled against the chains, spouting insults and vulgarities. He didn&#39;t understand why this injustice was being allowed or why the commander himself was hurting Higane in that way. 

It would be fair to say he was quite ignorant to the nuances of the Hyuuga clans traditions. Even so, he wouldn&#39;t be happy with them regardless. He stopped struggling and narrowed his eyes, looking down at the Uzumaki. <font color = white>&#34;How dishonorable...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
