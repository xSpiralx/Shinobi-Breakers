<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) Nodding to each as they introduced themselves he pulled out three scrolls and handed them to each student. He then took a fourth one out and revealed the information inside it.

<font color = white>&#34;These are signup scrolls. Please fill these out and have your parents sign them then bring them back. If you do not have parents then sign the second line that states so.&#34;</font>

He points to each section

<font color = white>&#34;The first section is simple. Just your name, age, eye color basic descriptors. The second section goes over what you will be doing while at the academy. The third section is a waiver that states any harm recieved during training courses is not to be used against the academy. The fourth section states that this course is made to raise shinobi of the village and what that entails.&#34;</font>

He smiles once again and rolls the scroll up.

<font color = white>&#34;Feel free to fill these out in your spare time but know that school starts soon so don&#39;t take too long.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yoru Hoshigaki (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nods his head as he grabs scroll from the instructor. He could read just enough but it&#39;s not like he truly understood what many of it meant, but he was told enough.

<font color = white>&#34;Great! Signing up!&#34;</font> He bit his forefinger before writing his information down on the scroll. Just the basics as asked.

Name: Yoru
Age: 12
Doing: Learning!

He held his hand out for Shion to grab it back.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) takes the scrolls and nods.
<font color = white>&#34;Thanks.&#34;</font> he said.
<font color = white>&#34;And how soon is soon?&#34;</font> he asked the jounin as he returned back to his teaching partner. <font color = white>&#34;Like in an hour?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) says: I can start teaching as soon as I have students but I believe the year starts sometime later today. I would say try to get the l scroll signed in the next 6 hours.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) went ahead and begin to fill out the paperwork, it was quite simple as the man had stated. 

-Yoshimitsu, 15.- 

Took him a bit to think over the doing part, was it asking him what he wanted to train in? He would stop and ask.

<font color = white>&#34;Umm, for this doing part is like what we aiming to learn?&#34;</font> He asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shiroimu, Shion(The warm man-Limb) OOCs: (also I am a chunin)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) would give a nod before going back to fill it in.

-Taijutsu/Kenjutsu-

The male would finish up with how he looks and then sign his name. After which he would turn the paper in.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) takes the scroll from yoru and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;If you needed a pen I could have offered one. Should have kinda handed those out was not expecting a scroll this quickly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) tosses the scroll back to the chuunin. If he had paid attention, he would have noticed Tajin did not bring out any writing utensils thus leaving the scroll blank.

<font color = white>&#34;Yokai, Tajin. Twelve years old and I plan doing whatever is needed most of in the village. My mom said she agrees with all the terms and the conditions of the school so no need to bring anything home.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only look at Nunya, as he would shake his head. <font color = white>&#34;Why would we know, when were not yet full shinobi?&#34;</font> he would then turn to the Inuzuka that was also the police chief, giving him a nod.

<font color = white>&#34;Well nice to officially meet you chief, names Himotachi, Sora, and this one is my brother Takuma.&#34;</font> they would point to the Ambitious one who had been a bit quiet till then.

<font color = white>&#34;A pleasure to meet you chief and aye, you seem quite straight forward.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) scratches the back of her head idly as she wondered what the heck was going on currently...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stares blankly at the barking dog. He would tilt his head slightly inquisitively, as the man spoke to the dog, almost as if he understood it.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...You speak dog?&#34;</font>, he asked, his eyes settling on the animal once again.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) has decided to take a walk from the compound of his clan to the Kage manor where he was supposed to sign up for the academy and figure out what is going on in this village nowadays. Since he became of age to join Shinobi ranks, Gosame was really excited and eager to meet new people.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what my boss would say to this...maybe I should wait for him?&#34;</font>

He would think while walking with his hands firmly placed at back of his head. Step by step he was slowly in front of the manor where he wonders what this group of people has gathered around for. In a friendly manner he smiles and joins them.

<font color = white>&#34;Erm...hello. I am Gosame and I am looking for someone to sign me up in the academy?&#34;</font>

Tall boy inquires, his skin was slowly turning blue as well due to their pigmentation that Hoshigaki get once when they become of age.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods towards people that replied. He wonders about what to do next since the Academy head was not around which was rather unfortunate.

<font color = white>&#34;I see, well then I will have to go with secondary option....unfortunate.&#34;</font>

Gosame smiles to those that have introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to have heard at least one name...its nice to meet you Sora.&#34;</font>

After saying that with quite friendly tone, Gosame repositions his hands into his hoodie pocket since his hands were slowly going numb.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) says: I thought he said his name was Yoru Prey...
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's how I took it
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: That'd be a weird last name.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looks confused at everyone repeating prey. Were they not understanding the word?

He nodded at the muscle head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Everyone else is prey! We just protect these prey.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Hey uh...I dont like being called prey.
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Geto, Takeshi - for anyone who didn't catch it

<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: ?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would shrug his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Right sure....I suppose.&#34;</font> honestly alot of them were quite interesting, but quite a bit out there as well as he would move towards the building sitting down on the sidewalk, leaning against it, as he opened up a bag and took out a book to read.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hm....I mean if you think like that, it could help you fight like you were prey....adrenaline shortcut maybe
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I am not an illusion? Is prey confused?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) sighs and shakes his head, ignoring the further comments of Yoru. This certainly was an interesting group of people, but he had no time for games. He would head to the front of the academy and wait for an instructor to arrive.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where did everyone go?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) was confused a little bit by the arrival of Yoru. He did not know how to teach his kin about the conversation and proper etiquette of other Shinobi in the village that they protect.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh...well....prey is something we hunt down and play with or hunt down and eat....but I am sure that Yoru doesnt mean it on a bad side.&#34;</font>

Gosame has begun to explain, he was wondering just why is Yoru constantly calling people prey. Was he not taught how to talk properly in public? Regardless, he didnt want to be a smartass and call him out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) would cough a few times Yoru&#39;s smell was crazy bad <font color = white>&#34;Hey.. This has to be a crime.&#34;</font> he says his eyes watering a bit.

His hound Kane would Bark at the Smelly teen.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only chuckle. <font color = white>&#34;Why do you think that I am all the way over here chief?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) looks to Gosame with a nod

<font color = white>&#34;Ah I get it...that&#39;s okay, if he treats his enemies as prey, he&#39;ll get along with me just fine!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: If he does not, big boss will put him in place.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only nod to them before turning to the chief. <font color = white>&#34;So, chief whats one gotta do to join the police force anyways, figured I would ask and see what happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's a good question
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Bad side? Prey is prey. No good or bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) stretched her arms over her hea, <font color = white>&#34;Huh.. where did everyone go?&#34;</font> She&#39;d wonder.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Everyone is here, few people left but thats about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) asks: Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looked at the hound, tilting his head.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, prey? Hungry? I&#39;m not prey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) looks over to sora. <font color = white>&#34;To join the force.. The minimum requirement would to be a genin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;We have a long path ahead of us, especially to become Genin. That one is really important.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read his book as he listened to the chief, when his question was answered. <font color = white>&#34;Well that is good to know chief, I might have to join when I am able to then...I think that with my skills I might be a great addition, but of course that also remains to be seen.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: My name?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Yep.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) tilted her head to the side as she eyed the sharp-toothed kid.
     <font color = white>&#34;My name&#39;s Reimi..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) gives Sora a heads up <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods in understanding.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Hoshigaki Gosame. Its nice to meet you Reimi.&#34;</font>

He says with wide and happy smile, he came here to meet new people and sign up to attend the academy and become Genin to begin with.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I knew she lied.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Reimi makes more sense.
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Obviously did you really think Nunya was their name?
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Do I look stupid to you
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Never said you did
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Nunya sounds like a prey name.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: fits well.
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: You probably prey on boys
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: I do not have a preference on gender.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Damn...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: A question though. Did anyone sign up at all? Because if not....we can just camp the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue reading as he flipped to another page. <font color = white>&#34;I believe that is exactly what we are doing currently Gosame.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I signed up!
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: Same.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: I think I signed up?

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Thats awesome! I cant wait to sign up as well.
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) asks: Yeah, who with?

<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where is it?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: With the instructor, prey.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would point to the big building everyone is infront of.. <font color = white>&#34;This is the accademy, but it was empty when I was inside just a bit ago, still it is good to know a name of someone to look for.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) points to the building next to them with his index finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Apparently, according to the people that have been signed up already that is the academy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: I'm on my way then!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: Thanks!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Here I am again
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But there is....nobody inside I think.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: Where is the instructor?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) looks to the academy and back then blinks.

<font color = white>&#34;What in the...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Least no one was Gosame when I was in there last, and no one seemed to come in and out that I have seen, I can easily go look again
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Indeed it is still empty
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: We all have to train hard in and out of the academy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (im sorry but uh Allies within 3 tiles of a Sarutobi are bolstered by their leadership, gaining +5 to strength, speed and stamina.

<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hai we will.

<font color = white>&#34;Yoru...one day you will call someone prey and they will beat you up. Be careful.&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Prey will always be prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: And prey must someday fall
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods towards Yoru, he understood him completely. Other villages were prey but not their friends.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: I havent seen pops yet but....I am not sure. If you calling people prey causes issues you might have to stop it.

He then looks off into the distance for a moment. 

His hound too would tilt it&#39;s head and look back at his brother from another mother for a moment. Mosai would simply nod his head causing the large hound to run off.
