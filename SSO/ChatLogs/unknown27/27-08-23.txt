<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) quickly finished his meal as it wouldn&#39;t take long for his next bowl to come up.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not pitying you. Like you said, you&#39;ll pay me back, so this is ain&#39;t charity.&#34;</font>

Despite his initial smirk, at the very least his tone wasn&#39;t demeaning. <font color = white>&#34;That aside though, nice to meet you Hajime.&#34;</font> Tapping his chopsticks against one another as their introductions were over, the chef came up and finally served them their food.

It was good to see the other boy digging into the food rather than flat out refusing it. <font color = white>&#34;You should take it easy.&#34;</font> He slides a cup of water near Hajime&#39;s bowl.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ah, a cereal thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) does not take it easy in the least.

He&#39;s chowing down on the ramen as if it were the last noodle dish on the planet, shoveling food into his mouth faster than what he could chew it and he eventually finishes it off with a massive slurp from the bowl..!

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, man. That was great...&#34;</font> He admits, patting his stomach a couple of times before he rises to his feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Really?&#34;</font> He asks, glancing back at the young Uchiha.

<font color = white>&#34;Most of your kind would not say so.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was digging in on his ramen as well after sliding that water. Man, he really loved this place, not really the most nutritional food, but damn! It was great! A little after Hajime was done with his own, so was Yuuto. He sure could eat well despite being young.

<font color = white>&#34;Most of my kind?&#34;</font> Raising an eyebrow at the bright boy, the Uchiha smirked again. <font color = white>&#34;You sure make it sound that we&#39;re all the same.&#34;</font> He placed his chopsticks on top of the empty bowl.

<font color = white>&#34;Work hard as much as you want, but when you gotta eat and rest, you should very well take it easy. Just being serious all the time doesn&#39;t work out.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: You do look alike!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Like, a lot alike.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I can't afford to take it easy.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Most of use weren't gifted with what you guys were.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Us, even.
<br><font color=green>*Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Haha okay, okay, it's fair to say that we do look alike.
<br><font color=green>*Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: And well, you say you can't afford to take it easy. Let me ask you then, what you do?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'm going to be Shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's what I'm going to do.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Better than you, too.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i wonder how many points we can get in a day
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) nods a couple of times.

Clearly, he was assuming that the Uchiha would become one, as well.

He wasn't wrong.

The orphan rises to his feet on that note, before stretching both arms to limber up a tad. As he stretches, the tattered nature of his clothing which was full of messy patchwork is more prominent. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) froze for a moment, wondering if he should take this seriously or not... but after a few seconds of consideration, he couldn&#39;t help but have another silly smirk on his face. <font color = white>&#34;Now that&#39;s fun.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;If there&#39;s one thing I can say is that I would like to see you trying.&#34;</font> The orphan had assumed right, after all, what Uchiha wouldn&#39;t want to be a Shinobi, born and raised to fight, there was no other path for them.

Digging in his pocket, he slapped a coule ryo bills on the counter alongside with a tip for the business owner. <font color = white>&#34;Thanks for the meal, chef.&#34;</font> He got off his chair and turned to face Hajime again.

<font color = white>&#34;But hey, if you say that you wanna be a Shinobi, better than me even, then you must have a talent. Carre to share?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: T-talent?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You all really do think the same...
<br><font color=green>*Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: Are you gonna tell me you don't have something you excel at?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) shakes his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Shinobi don&#39;t reveal their tricks so easily.&#34;</font> He deflects. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) became a little more serious now. His smirk retracting slightly. <font color = white>&#34;Now that I can respect.&#34;</font> This other kid sure was fun. <font color = white>&#34;In the academy, we&#39;ll end up competing anyways, so we&#39;ll see what the other is capable of then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah. I suppose we will.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I won't lose to any of you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yanashi, Nago (The odd ball-LewdPetRock) Was bored enough to observer the interaction...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) declares his intent..!

He eventually takes steps to walk away, in determined fashion, for a few paces. Until he realizes that he had no idea of where to go, and switches location haphazardly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watches Hajime as he turns his back after declaring his intent. <font color = white>&#34;I wouldn&#39;t be so worried about other people yet.&#34;</font> He already had his eyes on Hajime. If anyone was going to compete with that optmisitc boy, then it would be him.</font></font></font>

He already looked forward to the day the academy would come. <font color = white>&#34;Until then, things are gonna be so  boring...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shisho (The sturdy youngster-MidnightStroll) wandered the village as if she owned it entirely. With a smirk on her face, she approaches the overconfident boy, and aims to give a prompt slap on the back. <font color = white>&#34;Borinng?! How can things be boring!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gets smacked in the back out of nowhere. The sensation lingers like a burn on his back for a moment as he hisses in pain. <font color = white>&#34;Damn, hold back on those slaps.&#34;</font>

Rubbing his back, he sees the officer approaching and stands a little straighter. <font color = white>&#34;Oh, yes, ma&#39;am..&#34;</font> And with that, he would get going.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) pauses for a moment, does she not notice him...? This lady&#39;s a Shinobi, no? If so, then she should be able to realize her precious weapon is about to be swiped away from her at any given moment! Shun&#39;Ichi hesitates, turning over toward his sister once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, that girl&#39;s a Shininijobi or whatever, right?&#34;</font> He aims to clarify, since Sakuya&#39;s been outside longer than he has, perhaps she was present whenever Komo demonstrated some sense of skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: Never needed one? You're tha strong?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t seem to care about the formal attire of his cousin, not even their young age. It should be pretty standard for Uchiha&#39;s to have some geniuses every now and then, and he was curious as to what Kohaku was capable of.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh trust me, I spotted quite a few promising... if not interesting, people already.&#34;</font> If both Kohaku and Batsu followed his gaze, they would see him glancing at Might, Try and then at both Hajime and Shishorama talking near the police officer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) eyes did not change from his normal blank, bored expression. Was this some kind of prank? His cold black eyes merely looked at Try, unblinking.

<font color = white>&#34;Support? Uh...Are you feeling okay?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: OH YEAH!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: ou're not that strong are you?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Never better Raihara. Why?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Yes, legends of the village would say I have a hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Cuz today starts our shinobi adventure! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) delicately shakes his hand with the appropriate amount of strength. She took great care not to actually harm her future comrades and classmates. It was her duty to protect those weaker than her, and she&#39;d uphold that belief until the bitter end.

<font color = white>&#34;When I win, I&#39;ll treat you to some food after.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: No reason...Nevermind it.
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: It looks like it.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: We should meet some of the other students.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) Kohaku didn&#39;t look much younger than Batsu, wondering just what he meant by feeling out of place. It felt natural for the Uchiha himself to finally become apart of the academy after the years of waiting. He&#39;d nod toward his clan member though, a head nod that usually gestures a greeting.

The statement about passing though the academy would resonate with him though, he&#39;d already expected the academy to be something he could easily maintain as his parents had made him study for as long as he could remember.

<font color = white>&#34;Pleasure to meet you Kohaku and yes... We will indeed exceed in this years academy.&#34;</font> he said, smirking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: But there are so many.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) asks: Do you want to have a hard ass head too? Or you just wanting to give it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) clicked her tongue, and idly produced a book from within her garment. Adding a pen to the mix, she began to scribble down on a seemingly blank page. Mysteries upon mysteries were written, surely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Well, I can introduce you to a few.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hummm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) scoffed at the declaration that he&#39;d beat herself and the other one. So, she did what anyone else in her position would. Push his buttons even harder.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... I&#39;ll just verbally agree to beat you then, I wouldn&#39;t want to touch your hand...&#34;</font> Her nose upturns just a tad, as though she would have caught something being too close to him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) stepped up to Kohaku and put his fists on his hips as he stared intently at the Uchiha trio just... breathing... waiting.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Already making friends?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (dont mind my fists on your hips)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stands behind Try, his cold eyes just examining the three students before him. He would not make any introductions.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Medical Nin are quite excellent at giving hard ass he-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) reachs out and touches Shun&#39;Ichi green hair without permission. <font color = white>&#34;Is this natural?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) covers her mouth... She forgot she was with children.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had no idea that he had been held back on.

He simply figured that despite being part of the Senju, she was a girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;No way. I don&#39;t accept hand outs.&#34;</font> 

Despite Hinoue&#39;s clear reluctance, he steps forth and raises a fist towards her, to seek a fist bump. Defiant eyes lock onto her own. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ...And I'd never lose to you, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: ....... Don't worry about that! Answer my question, is that sword girl a ninshija?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (Does this game function like most nrp)

<font color = white>&#34;You... can simply say hello, Try.&#34;</font> He was very much as interesting as his cousin stated him to be, how refreshing and out of the box. A chuckle escaped him, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Uchiha, Kohaku... How are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) had found themselves engrossed, reading over the orphan&#39;s shoulder. Who would&#39;ve thought a novel like this could be so attention grabbing?! She wanted to see if the hero would successfully save the kidnapped heroine!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m done with that page. Turn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yells: Ah--- She got away!

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You should really try to be a little cooler, Try.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Positivity is good for the morale of others, so that's a good thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) cocks her head toward Kohaku as she hears her name being mentioned. "You wanted to talk?!'</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) spared a glance over toward Komo. Upon realizing that the older woman was insistent on tomorrow&#39;s start date, she clicks her tongue. Stepping further down the path, she turns her attention out toward the gathering.

<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) saw Might Try approaching that the Hatake kid from before. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> He extend a fist for a bump. <font color = white>&#34;Hatake, Raihara, right?

     The main character's training montage would continue, but would they be successful?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Her statement seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as the optimistic one rapidly approached with a fist held out, intent on connecting some type of gesture that was evidently foreign to her with the confusion crawling across her visage. So, what could she do except from taking an offensive stance?!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to fight me right now?&#34;</font>

Legs set further apart, bending ever so slightly at the knees as all digits furl upon both hands - only for the index and middle to extend in an untrained stance. Unique to her lineage.</font></font></font>

Far from impressed with her polished combat stance that had been handed down across generations, he seems shocked, apalled even. He leans back a tad, as if now -he- were the one who could catch something from her.

He turns to face Kyoko on that note, and takes a step away from the Hyuuga, turning his back towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll play.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, milk-eyes, what&#39;s the game like?&#34;</font> He initiated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I doubt it's gambling. She's an officer of the law!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) feels a twinge in her heart, forced to recoil at the girl&#39;s statement. Somehow, she made it sound a lot worse than it actually was..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, this was a fine day- Though they weren&#39;t nobles he&#39;d hope for the two to fair well in the academy, it&#39;s not that he looked down on them. It was simply instilled at a young age he was to protect them, simply because the nobles were born with strong traits and nothing more. Mental conditioning was strong in this one, though he wasn&#39;t ruled by it.

<font color = white>&#34;I do, too... Just don&#39;t push yourselves too much, hard work is fine until you pull a muscle. It happens to everyone eventually.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

After all, given the circumstances, he figured most folks around were probably younger than him.

Still, he managed to conjure up a sheepish grin in return, refusing to let rudeness take over. <font color = white>&#34;Kaoru.&#34;</font> He replied, giving a brief introduction..</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) attempts to take a step forth, as he was the first one who answered a question. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) All the students gathered infront of the Konohagakure memorial, the woman reached behind her to grip her hand against the &#39;weapon&#39;. A fancy stick with several tags around it.
  She pulled out an attachment, a small spade like object that she wiggled into place on the top of her staff. The tool now resembles a hoe.

<font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Konoha&#39;s academy course. Ya&#39;ll be training to be shinobi that defends the lands of Fire, we shinobi are the heartline of this nation - Just like farmers.&#34;</font>

 Komo tosses her hoe hard towards the dirt behind the students, piercing and parting the dirt with force.

<font color = white>&#34;Instead of feeding mouths, we shinobi solves and prevent those farmer&#39;s problems from interrupting them making harvest.&#34;</font>

A hand extended facing the handed tool, as it suddenly came back to her grasp. <font color = white>&#34;To do that, we practice and master the use of all life force Chakra. Before we git to all that...&#34;</font>

The woman places the hoe back to her rear, facing the memorial.

<font color = white>&#34;This memorial is what we call tribute, tribute to all the shinobi that has succeeded their limits for their nation, some giving up their lives for you to even breathe and be born. The Will of Fire. If you disrespect this, you&#39;re disrespecting your births. Ya&#39;ll remember that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

His focus then shifted to the Tribute memorial... and he became a little more serious, even though the situation between Shishorama and the other Hyuuga was anything but that in his eyes.</font></font></font>

As the explanation went on and once a position of leadership was offered with a stick, he just scrunched up his face and thought that was a little beneath him. He didn't want to just flex his strength around for a stick, so he stood back on that.</font></font></font>

For the present, he opted to be an observer and follow instructions without much fuss. But he knew deep down that this wasn't a stance he intended to maintain forever.

He held fast to the belief that everything will fall into place when the time's right. So long as he does his part and does it well.</font></font></font>

Wondering if he should also step up, but he wondered what the Headmaster really meant by elements... What was involved? Most whom stepped up were more durable or stronger from looking by a glance.

Wasting no time he jumps up upon the side of the mountain and grabs onto the rocks. A quick glance was given to those who stepped up as well, some girl with white hair and a kid who's name was...Try? That didn't matter, now was not the time to get distracted.

focusing back onto the rock he'd start his climb, his first real moment of the academy. determined not to make a fool of himself the young man doesn't focus on being fast or first, but on consistency. Maybe he wouldn't get to the top first, but he was damn sure going to get there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) pointed at the mountain.

- <font color = white>&#34;All I have to do is beat it up, right?&#34;</font>

Momoko instead moved back and walked to the nearest lake, kneeling close to it, getting a handfull of water and splashing it across her face. She got up, dusted herself off, took her sandals off, set them aside, and looked right back up at the TALL mountain.

Momoko held her fists back, and started to accumulate momentum. . .

Beginning to utilize the infamous Super Peel Out, Trademarked, catching up with speed and boosting at high-mach towards the Mountain! Her hand shot back,

dramatically reaching out towards the rock, with a blitz effect covering up her POV, flames erupting out of her fingertips, GRIPPING on one rock-hard surface!

Momoko started to punch the mountain&#39;s walls, beginning to climb at a ridiculously fast pace, surpassin-

no, wait, she hasn&#39;t even gotten one meter above the ground. Momoko is scratching the surface at comically high speeds and going nowhere, because physics decided they&#39;d specifically fuck her over.

She looks like a feral cat trying to get over some curtains.</font></font></font>

He moved over to his sister, <font color = white>&#34;Time to make up for having me miss my chance last time.&#34;</font> He hinted, eyeing the woman&#39;s blade once again.

&#39;<i>If I can stomach the shock from touching her blade.... I can probably...&#34; The boy&#39;s mute-red hues kept a close gaze, calculating his chances.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) looked at her brother.

<font color = white>&#34;You will throw me up. Then, I will catch you from the top.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Towa (The ashen haired girl-ZenchuZaaRachu) would instead watch for a short while. She wore glasses and held books close to her chest. And darted her eyes across the field upon seeing most of her peers climbing the rock.

She decided to give it an attempt, definately soon.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn't want to use his strength to get a stick but climbing was another thing entirely. He thought that he might as well go ahead and see what he can do when it comes to climbing. He was pretty strong and agile, but beyond that, he lacked in almost every other aspect.

Patting his hands together, he was a bit confused of how to go about it at first, and figured he would just jump for the first big rock he could see. Easily managing to make use of his upper body strength to pull himself up... only to dangle for a few moments trying to find a proper foothold for his feet... well that was a bit embarassing.

Still, he found a spot after a few tries and afterwards, it was bit like smooth sailing till halfway up.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;You should throw me instead and I will catch you.&#34;</font> He doesn&#39;t want to slip and fall to his doom. She was prone to sweat.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) narrowed her gaze momentarily, before assuming a careful stance. Her arms are read to grab at his own, and her legs are bent to roll her frame downward to catapult him upward.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay.&#34;</font> The girl replied, bidding him to get a running start.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) gave up trying to climb using her hands.

Momoko walked away and instead approached the closest tree - aggressively kicking the base of it.

A conveniently large-sized tree branch fell off, stabbing the floor beneath her. She is NOT using her brains nor is she trying to use teamwork at all, she's just bashing her face first into it and hoping it works.

And by that, she's now going to use the stick as a trampoline, aligning it just right. She read it in comics, certainly, it can work.

Momoko jumped towards the wall, kicked off it, and dived straight into the stick.  . .

<i>tic</i>.

Only for it to snap like a twig, anticlimatically resulting in nothing happening.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) locked his fingers together with his palms facing upwards and turned his back to the cliff. He didn't need to be the first one up to the next stage of the mountain; this wasn't a race. This was a group effort, and every group needed an anchor! He scanned those gathered for who might take the launch.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) shrugged, that was as good a plan as any he supposed, so he hopped onto the cheerful lad&#39;s back. All they had to do was... get over the mountain by any means.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kohaku of the Uchiha by the way, I hope you&#39;re good at climbing... I am not.&#34;</font> The boy affirmed, knowing his strength lies with using his chakra.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Climbing rocks isn't so hard if you plan it out before you start.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Push with your legs, don't use your arms to try to pull yourself up.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: And use your core to keep your body close to the cliff!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) began pushing his sister over between the mountain and Komo.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mooon, you owe me anyway, just help me out witth this okay?&#34;</font> He begs, taking another glance at the Chuunin in hopes she doesn&#39;t walk off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) || Climb up that mountain? It looks more like a plateau. How in the world is he going to do this? And more importantly- How is he going to get the others up there as well? 

He watched as everyone grappled with their own approaches, attempting various methods to conquer the vertical terrain. And then, as if a puzzle piece snapping into place, an idea took shape in his mind. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, the cogs of his mind whirring.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm. . .&#34;</font> He mused aloud. A lightbulb flickered above his head as an idea finally kicked in, he projected his voice even louder.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, folks!&#34;</font> His tone raised, hoping that everyone would heed his words.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s take turns giving each other a boost, and then use the human chain we create to pull up the stragglers. We&#39;ll make it together that way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: But I don't have any chains.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is glad this was so readily accepted. The pale student moves himself back, as close to the water as he can manage without risk of slipping and falling in before suddenly charging forward.

With the running start he will draw closer to his sister before anticipating where she holds the flats of her palm, awaiting the leverage to send him skyward with a press of the foot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With utmost confidence, Shishorama stands tall and unwavering before the formidable mountain. She flexes her fingers, producing a satisfying crackling sound, and rotates her neck to loosen any tension before taking a determined step forward. Despite being presented with a daunting task, she took it upon herself to undergo it. 

Shisho charges towards the towering rock formation. As she approaches, she reaches out to touch its rugged surface, feeling the rough texture under her fingertips. Though the task seems daunting, with nothing but her own strength and unwavering resolve, she sets out to climb it, determined to conquer the daunting challenge.

With a steady pace and an unwavering smile, she ascends the mountain, pushing herself to her natural limits. The sweat on her face and the strain in her muscles are clear signs of the effort she is putting into the climb. Nevertheless, she refuses to be defeated by the physical toll and makes her way to the top.

<font color = white>&#34;ARGGHHHHH!&#34;</font> The intense young woman <b>ROARS</b> at the top of her lungs once the pinnacle had been reached, claiming her victory among the students that remained at the bottom of the rocky formation. 

<font color = white>&#34;HERE STANDS, SENJU SHISHORAMA! SUCCESSOR OF THE WILL OF FFIIIIIIRRREEEEE!!!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) , with his hands still linked together to provide a boost and his back to the cliff face turned and looked to the late bloomer. <font color = white>&#34;Great idea! I&#39;ll boost you up first, then you can help pull them up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) asks: What do you need me to do?
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: Alright, that's one- There's two.
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) asks: Anyone else want in?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I can push or I can go up and pull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) struck with perfect timing, suggesting that these acrobatic feats were practiced often-- or else, the pair shared some instinctual link, giving them the sort of frame-perfect coordination required to achieve this. Either way, in one graceful, fluid motion the girl rolled and the boy was boosted, propelled by both palms and feet high into the air; he'd be able to make it up for sure.

The dancer, for her part, is quick to get off the ground and brush the dirt from her clothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: In>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) stared at the bloodly samurai that just snapped a branch from the tree. She points to the ground before speaking.

<font color = white>&#34;If ya&#39;ll get hurt or something, just use nature&#39;s bandaid. Rub some dirt on it.&#34;</font>

She said, as she examined the other groups. Some were trying to work together, not a bad plan. Probably the most easiest way to complete a task, however it depends on the core strengths of the members for it to be a success.
  Komo would step her way around the groups of academy students, plugging her ears when she made her way by the Intense Senju, watching him head to the top of the mountain.

  Clan strength was truly something else...

She watched as others adopted the samurai&#39;s tactics, using their surroundings to climb such a object.

<font color = white>&#34;Resourceful.&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: Either role works, just that I'll be counting on the physically strongest to reel in the rest.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) Although the Uchiha hand't found a good spot to continue to climbing, he managed to see one just out of reach. He had an idea of what to do and wanting to show himself capable, he tried to get to it straight away...but... there was some hesitation as he would need to jump and be airborne for a moment, if he missed, he was screwed.

The fall wasn't THAT great though, so with his heart speeding up, he took a deep breath and made a leap, hands shooting forward eagerly, almost desperately for the crevice that would allow him to continue on.

Afterwards, he had to take a few deep breaths to calm down and continued on! Now he wasn't as a fraid as before, and just as he was about to reach the top, he heard Shishorama's screams of excitement.

He was just a bit too late for it. Well, next time!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) looked up towards the cliffside with a gulp.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow.&#34;</font> he says softly, tugging at his collar. They&#39;d look around to the others, looking for reactions perhaps. He had hoped to see others as worried as he was, hoping to not seem TOO out of place with his fear of heights.

<font color = white>&#34;O-okay!&#34;</font> he said, marching towards the mountain now. He studied the rock&#39;s face with intensity, planning his way before actually even trying. They saw nooks and crannies that would potentially fit his hands and feet. After awhile of putting together a strategy, he&#39;d move!

One hand stretched up first, his foot following after as it placed itself in a crack along the rocks. Not even ten feet up he&#39;d look down, eyes becoming wide as he saw the ground below.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh...&#34;</font> he sighed, looking back up now. contiuing the climb with a slow pace. He wouldn&#39;t rush it, just knowing he only had to reach the top and wasn&#39;t asked to do so with haste. Finally, he would grasp a hand on the top of the cliff, pulling himself up to the top shakily. 

<font color = white>&#34;I-I did it!&#34;</font> he&#39;d roar, looking down the cliffside before fainting, falling on his backside from the fear it had induced!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I can pull then.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll go up first.
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I can pull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Climbing climbing climbing this was turning out to be easier than expected, but then again what kid didn&#39;t like to climb on things? Despite this being labeled as official training it was nothing new to the young kid. He had spent many days in the past running around the village and climbing to places he probably shouldn&#39;t have.

Reaching out with his hand and pushing up with his legs, a boundless stamina allowed the kid to continue up the mountain with little trouble, it was only about passing the halfway point did he hear Shishorama yell out....damn she had beaten him. Oh well, it didn&#39;t matter. 

Reaching the top of the first track he looks back and only now realizes how high up they really were....perhaps this was a bit different from the school yard. Regardless he yells down 

<font color = white>&#34;Right I&#39;ll help anyone else up &#34;</font> he offers to the ones below.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I like pulling things.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: . . .She clocked out again.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: More and more of you are getting to the top... Maybe this mountain isn't tall enough.
<br><font color=red>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yakeru(The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) OOCs: (continuing*)
<br><font color=green>*Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: Now... how do I jump that high...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is launched and that, folks, was all that she wrote. His slight frame coupled with quantum mechanics and some other shit leads to him getting to a pretty solid place on the mountain. Yet, with a particularly large rock he will have to cling to in order to hold on.

His arm is over the base of it and all of his strength is used to keep himself there. Thus, he turns, <font color = white>&#34;Jump now.&#34;</font> Otherwise it will be for nothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#884250>Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) gives a beaming smile and turns towards the mountain, not entirely paying attention to formalities <font color = white>&#34;That crevasse will make a decent spot!&#34;</font> he states excitedly, not wanting to expend too much energy for when he comes to collect others.
 He beings to climb using the crack, leisurely climbing as he hums a tune..  Untill he starts to stagger a bit quickly checking up on the Uchiha on his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Make sure to hold on as tight as ya can!&#34;</font> He shouts and before long.. with a few near stumbles, but a generally calm climb, the two make it up beside the others at the top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Hey Shishorama, how about we go down there? I wonder how far up we can help boost someone up if we do it toegether.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Oh, good idea!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: It's my duty to help them up!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That is correct.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) starts to climb down... well, that oughta be easier than climbing up, surely... right?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: Hurry.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Half the task is getting up there, the second one is getting the rest of the class there too.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: You heard Sensei, if one fails we all fail.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: ...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clapped her hands, the noise a resounding acknowledgement of his words. She's got a target to leap to and intends to make it there. A quick look around found her a branch, and the little eleven year old wielded it with impossible strength as she took a step back and then ran forward. Her pole finds the sandy ground of the river bank and lets her careen forward. Deftly, she jumped from it, and one small arm found itself reaching.

She grabbed at his wrist, thudding into the mountain harshly. 

That should have hurt, but she didn't make a sound. Moments later, she's found herself some footholds, and they've got a signfiicant headstart on the mountain.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) put his plan into motion. Leaning his back against the wall and adopting a squatting stance, he formed his hands into a makeshift platform, ready to serve as a human springboard. This would give the more physically capable members, the Samurai and the Youth a chance to utilize their strength not just to gain height, but also to secure a grip on a ledge, providing a sturdy foundation for their climb.

If the pieces fell into place as hoped, the Samurai and the Youth would lift him up next, a sequence that would repeat as they ascended. His own role came next  using his position as a link, connecting the chain formed by the others. Depending on their willingness and ability, either the Youth or the Samurai could be the anchor and hook.

He acknowledged that not everyone would be on the same wavelength as him, so he proceeded with those who were on the same page. His personal charisma might influence some, but he understood its limits.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (does anyone know if there's a doc with the combat rules
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: so we got to get up there...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Just hold up a moment, we'll be right down there to help ya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;--&#34;</font>

Shun&#39;Ichi shot his sister a scathing glare, mouthing inaudibly an <i>I&#39;ll do it myself</i> in her general direction before taking a glance to the mountain.

Three problems would arise, well--two and a half problems. First, there&#39;s no chance he&#39;s proficient enough to climb the mountain with these heavy clothes, and he doesn&#39;t have spares to replace them with--so no chance in a quick change.
Second: Komo&#39;s sword being flowed with some sort of chakra, being completely unaware of how chakra functions, the punk&#39;s simply going to have to go through with counteracting that... Somehow. 
He spits in his hands, rubbing the saliva together in order to produce an adequate amount of friction for the rough mountain walls to feel less abrase. In any case, the half problem comes to what Komo&#39;ll do if he&#39;s successful.

Assuming he&#39;ll even get close to grabbing her blade from the top of the mountain.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, climbing, that&#39;s easy... Yeah...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We're starting a chain.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We'll boost up and pull others up.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: You guys can be the next level up.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Oh! Nice idea.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Those who lack strength can get the most help.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The stronger ones can come up after!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Get on the chain you three on the back.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) clumsily rushes down the cliff face. After reaching the half-way point, she slips on a rock and tumbles down a flight. With a loud oof, the girl splatters against the stone ground. Bleeding from her skull as she was, she eagerly hopped to her fellow students and extended a steady hand to whoever might be needing assistance!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll help you! I&#39;ll help all of you!&#34;</font> She beams proudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) sat down and thinks. It was ethier let someone carry him up there or just fail.<font color = white>&#34;Uh  guess I sit here and wait..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll hang out in the middle until we get everyone up.

<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: That second ledge will be a little bit harder.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Leans down now and lays flat upon the mountain to steady himself as much as possible. Taking off his coat he quickly ties it to a nearby rock to anchor himself. Once all the set he leans over to the two white haired students below him.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright just get to me and I&#39;ll help pull you up&#34;</font> he calls down to them. It was a good idea Try had to help others out, and he could see even now the others were coming down to help as well. The class just might make it to the top.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We can go together.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: Fine...
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: We should dig up some dirt and push it against the cliffside for slightly higher ground to start with.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Remember! It's not a race but a team effort!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) Momoko dusted her hands off, took a few steps back, and hopped once - The momentum of her fall being used to start a jog, and soon a sprint, running straight up into the Bloomer's trampoline -

Getting leverage to LEAP up high into the next 'floor'.

Her hand reached out to the Overconfident Kid, trying to hold and hang to him!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) get's lifted up and followed the busy browed guy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) doesn't allow her to thud at all, in actuality. When she's snatched onto his extended hand, gripping him by the wrist the boy seems to swing with all of his momentuous strength (which wasn't much) and hurls the pale haired girl higher.

Oh baby, it was ice climbers time.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: We'll get there together! Yos!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) continued her observation of the students making their way to the top, some finally realizing the second part of this lesson. However, this exercise could be a little tough for the first day; but many of them already proved her wronng.
She held her staff close as some even got a few scratches along the way.

Komo's eyes were like an eagle, peering at every situation that could happen. Her thumb rubbing against the hilt of her staff - Red staining her thumb print as well as the hilt's steel end.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was kneeling by the edge together with Shishorama, just waiting for the first person that would be sent that way. The moment the first one came, he immediately reached out to firmly grab the hand of that samurai and pull them up on the second floor. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, now let&#39;s boost you up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) holded the tie. This was going to be ethier fine or a rough day.<font color = white>&#34;Damm be careful man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) opened an eyem,

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh okay...&#34;</font> he gulped, looking back down the cliffside before trying to climb back down. He aimmed to join the student made totem pole, trying to allow the others an express route up the cliffside along the others.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t let me fall!&#34;</font> he says, gripping onto the stone&#39;s face.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) safely landed, now instead, keeping the grip she had. She looked down at the Bloomer and the Dweeb -

Stretching her hand out to them, leaning in to the edge of the cliff! She's going to catch anybody that springs up to her height.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) is caught off guard, flying upward with a hefty momentum. Arms and legs scramble as she makes it just short of the edge, both arms grabbing onto a rocky outcropping. There&#39;s even more scrambling, as her grip shifts from two arms to two legs wrapped around the out-jutting, earth spike. She hung upside down like a monkey, arms both held out to catch her brother.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re going to the top.&#34;</font>

She could easily make it there from here, after all.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) took the boost step the late bloomer offered, planting his foot between his linked fingers before stepping up and taking the added height. He reached up and grabbed handholds in the cliff face with his rough and calloused fingers before peering around for a good route.

Thankfully, other students had already made the climb so he was beginning to see the path best to take. With a final cinch on the scarf at his waist Try looked down to the chill kid. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s just one step at a time.&#34;</font> He then began to work his way up, careful not to get too far from the chill kid in case something happened.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: To think I'd learn a lesson here! I need to put that in my notes!
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I have hands.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) nods. <font color = white>&#34;To the top,&#34;</font> A unanimous decision, born from an already understood agreement that they did not need to be first. Simply that they needed to get there. So he will prepare himself mentally as she hangs from a point of leverage.

He jumps, pushing off of the large rock and closer to his counterpart. His hand extends, ready to grip.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) shook his head. Grabing the scarf he just followed his lead. Simple right? He did not look down just for his sake. Looking down would made it worse for himself. Literally he could not give up even if he wanted to. He was locked in with the busy browed. No going back.

<font color = white>&#34;Are we there yet...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Oooo, we're close buddy!

<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: right...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) climbed up another few paces. He reached the midpoint between where he was previously and where Momoko and Shishorama were waiting with their hands outstretched. 

The dweeb was dirty and sweaty now with trickles of the stuff running down his temples and forehead to his masculine and handsome eyebrows where they were swept aside from his eyes as evolution intended. Try rubbed his head off his shoulder to scratch and itch and felt around for a hand hold he was confident in.

Once he felt secure he turned and looked down, breathing hard but feeling good. With one free hand he reached for the chill young boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) dug his palms into the mountain, feeling a rush of wind coming from the Kaguya duo gave him an idea... He let off a short hop, pinching the wall further as his legs stood parallel to his arms; he wondered if he could quickly switch position to dart up the wall backwards. Besides, given the amount of people congregating about, he can properly formulate a distraction adequate enough for him to compensate for his sister&#39;s lack of support.

He quips to himself on how quickly he darts, gaining a sense of confidence in his plan, he watches Komo&#39;s weapon as if it were prey, greediness hinted throughout his eyes, before he knew it, he was directly underneath the solemn youngster, accidentally grabbing ahold of the character&#39;s leg and losing some balance.

<font color = white>&#34;Shi--&#34;</font> He curses, quickly utilizing the youngster&#39;s weight to his advantage and flipping onto the first protrusion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod holding on as he was carried up- The distance from the ground got wider as the lad climbed, <font color = white>&#34;This would be easier if I could use my chakra to scale this thing.&#34;</font> He stated while looking down, while this happened he&#39;d just focus on molding his chakra for practice... No point in doing nothing while he was being hoisted into the air... One mountain side scale lead to another as he just looked down from above.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder how i would&#39;ve got up her without much climbing experience...&#34;</font> As he would eventually wonder how to help the others, <font color = white>&#34;Now how do I help them make their ways up here...&#34;</font> This would be easier wwith rope, maybe holding out his hand to help peole over the edge would be enough?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Once you can reach me you can reach them.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) caught him. There&#39;s no preservation of momentum, though that may have been easier. What followed was an almost impossible display core strength. Her legs remain hooked over the rock as if two heavy weights.  There&#39;s a look of focus and strain on her face as she used the power of her core to swing him back and forth, building up power with every sway until she&#39;s nearly teetering off her perch...

And then he&#39;s hurled skyward. As she freed him, she used this same momentum to mount the cropping she had wrapped herself around and jump to the next platform.

<font color = white>&#34;Watch out!&#34;</font> She called, to anyone who might be in the way of her flying brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watched the brother and sister, unable to help it, he nodded in admiration. <font color = white>&#34;Well damn, that&#39;s cool as hell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) eagerly awaited Try and company&#39;s approach. She was able to use this time wisely to regain her composure and strength enough to assist them when the time came.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re almost there! You guys are doing really good!&#34;</font> She cheered them on happily.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hey. We should fashion some rope together if we can.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I've got this scarf if anyone.. hn...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: else has something...

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: - I think the person behind me is wearing a scarf!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) caught the Bushy Dweeb with one single grasp, firmly holding him with little to no difficulty. Her muscles bulked, tensing as she grit her teeth, launching her head back to fully PULL him right down!

Now she&#39;d stretch her hand out to the chill young boy, alongside the bloomer.

- <font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mon. Jump. Do it.&#34;</font>

- <font color = white>&#34;If you ever, fall, just don&#39;t.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Wah!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) was coincidentally the unfortunate victim in the sibling duo's way, though his miniscule weight and strength would prove null to their cause, instead counteracting his own attempt to stay on the platform and knocking him airborne, tumbing down the mountain in a mixture of curses and whines.

Back to square one.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) gulped, slowly untying his scarf before handing it over.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t rip it.&#34;</font> he says softly, passing it along.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Im gonna go a level lower, dont fall!

Still it was almost like the punk was trying to pull him. Reguardless as his wrist was grabbed he&#39;d start to pull up bringing the Punk with him. only them to get knocked down...damn <font color = white>&#34;Push with your feet&#34;</font> he orders before turning to the side. 

<font color = white>&#34;Grab. My. Hand.&#34;</font> he calls out to the punk</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Come on, you can do it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) watched as the siblings slingshotted one to the skies, it seemed. She quickly held out a single handseal as her chakra engulfed her feet. Komo seemingly disappeared out of sight, merely to reappearer to the end destination of the flying boy.
  Just the first day, she wasn't intending in doing paperwork to explain why one of the students was in the hospital wing...

The Chuunin would appear inbetween the punk with twin scarves and the pale red-eyed boy. Extending her arms towards each of them in the attempts to prevent such a collusion.

(Shunshin.)</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Easy... Ya'll can't be going in reckless.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is certainly lacking in the department of core strength. No, his talents lie in the more acrobatic side of things. The impossible angles, the ease of access in which he could fit into cramped spaces, that sort of thing.

But as he billows through the air, momentum carrying him high, higher and to the highest peak their combined abilities could bring the both of them, he tucks and rolls into a standing finish when the time to land came.

He&#39;s covered in gravel and dirt but he was here. <font color = white>&#34;Can you jump?&#34;</font> He calls down to his sister! From this high even she would need some sort of miracle to simply clear the distance.

--, he turns to the cheerful one. <font color = white>&#34;Can you dangle me?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: I will hang and catch my sister. If you can.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) watched as it all went according to plan, more and more people are following his idea! This pleased him. Only a little. It expedited the exercise and made it a lot more orderly, that's enough for him.

With him being one of if not the last to get up, he proceeded to. . .Walk away?

He needed to make some distance, is all. He simply needed to 'wind up' before he begins moving.

<i>TAP</i>  <i>TAP</i>  <i>TAP</i>  <i>TAP</i> <i>TAP!</i>

He builds up a massive amount of speed, running swiftly towards the cliffside! And with a mighty leap, empowered with all that momentum he's gathered, he attempts to grab onto somebody's hand if they can reach him in time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) diligently scoured the area for any item that could aid her in her mission. Suddenly, the wandering child offered a scarf that caught her attention. Grateful for the unexpected gift, Shishorama tightly wrapped it around her hand. She then proceeded to lean down the treacherous cliff face and extended the scarf with all her might, hoping that Try would grasp onto it so that it would help them advance.

<font color = white>&#34;Come on, Try!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: Y-you can do it!

She had little time to stew over it before being approached by one of her likely classmates. She eyed him up--

<font color = white>&#34;You know gymnastics?&#34;</font> She asked, suspiciously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) sighed.

He had put his faith in the person.Trust or will of fire. Whatever worked he moved quick to be lifted.


<font color = white>&#34;Never again...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) saw the bloomer leap and swiftly reach out, with her own arm swinging like a fishing hook to firmly grasp his wrist, the type of shit you&#39;d see in Action Movies with sequences exactly like this.

A vicious, potent and strong arch from her arm, similarly to a clothesline, intent on not only grappling the bloomer, but also throwing him to her in one single go with the arch it was doing!

There is only little difficulty to her grasp, as she LAUNCHED the man right up to where they stood!

Nowhere near dirty enough to handle any semblance of defensive measure that staff may permit to him!
Meaning, he's stuck, so close, yet so far away.. Once they touched ground, Shun'Ichi slipped from the Chuunin's grip, adjacent to his target. He had, involuntarily, successfully scaled the mount--however, his test was far from over...</font></font></font>

His feet dug on the dirt beneath him as they adjusted themselves, and his grip became firm. Alright, he got it. <font color = white>&#34;Oh, and the name&#39;s Yuuto.&#34;</font>

With a smirk on his face, he wondered if this was about to surprise her. Anyhow, taking in a deep breath and holding it in, he launched her with as much strength as he could gather.</font></font></font>

So... he started to make his way down to meet them.

<font color = white>&#34;If you guys want, I can try to make this fast and try to launch you up there. What you think, want the boost up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) &#39;s eyes widened, it truly was a staff, not a sword.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: It's not about needing help, it's about a teamwork.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: What he said!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Mmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: And we already started this a while ago and established a system to help. It just makes it easier.
<br><font color=green>*Tategama (The sarutobi kid-Dissolutechris90) says: This guy gets it.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Get Kurorama and Hanako first. It's kinda' my fault they're late.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Err.. I've never climbed a rock before.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) put his back to the wall, a little distance away from it. He crouched on the ground and adjsut his feet, both his hands were brought up. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll try to launch you as far as I can, make sure to grab the wall and continue climbing or go for Shishorama.&#34;</font> He was pretty strong, he didn&#39;t know how far they would go, but better than on their own.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: The task is laid out for you, how you get it done is how a shinobi completes their mission.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: Okay okay... I'll be your lackey for three days if I fail! How's that sound?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) turned and reached up on the cliff face for any sort of hand hold that would bare his weight even as he slid the fishing rod over his shoulder. He then took a step up, digging the toe of his sandal into the stone face and turning his foot so that he had more surface touching. With a hop he reached another hand-hold and began the systematic climbing of the cliff. He was warmed up now but he was also a little fatigued, so this was just as hard, if not harder, than the first level, and the stakes were much higher. 

Slowly, but surely he worked his way up to the next level. The distance was farther than before but the group was counting on him. Shishorama even cheered for him and let him make the climb first! She trusted him!

The youth winced and hissed as his forearms started to cramp up and his hands went numb with charlie horses but he continued on, stopping only to shake his hands when he felt confident he could hold himself up.

Once Try weakly pulled himself over the top he laid flat on his stomach and took big, gasping breaths for air.

A long moment later the fishing line and scarf were lowered down to the chill boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) doesn't grab her on the way up, no. She had been fired off with much too much force to try and slow her down. He could only watch as the pale girl shoots up and over him, to which he turns and waddles in place, determining where she would fall.

Her lightness worked to his advantage in this department. It was very simple to ease her falling into a simple motion, swinging himself around with the excess inertia and planting her firmly on the rocky, cliffside ground.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh boy, maybe this means we can breathe for a minute.&#34;</font> he says in a hushed tone, watching the group begin to stratigize their climb. They&#39;d then think about the climb he was about to embark once more, having to face his fear of heights head on.

<font color = white>&#34;O-okay...&#34;</font> he mumbles, turning to face the cliff&#39;s edge once more. He&#39;d look around for those helping the others, aiming to use their strength to aid his efforts.

<font color = white>&#34;P-please don&#39;t drop me.&#34;</font> he gulps, sweating as he continued on up.</font></font></font>

She looked to help Yuuto ascend himself, but noted that he had gone all the way down to the bottom again. With a sigh, the dancer realized just how long this exercise would take and laid down on the rocky mountain top in exhaustion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Cracking his neck he walks up to the mountain once again, digs his hands into the earth and starts to climb. It seemed his efforts to help were largely ignored, ah well it didn't matter. He had his rest and with that he was off. Grabbing rock after rock he'd push up with his legs and scale the mountain just as he had before. Unlike the others he didn't need help.

Slowly but surely he'd make it to the top, that's all that really mattered to him right now.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) used the fishing line and the scarf to climb. Using his stamina , he focus on the task at hand. He did not need any distractions. To complete the task and forget  all the nonsense behind him. That was the easy enough to do. No hesitation or worry.

Climbing up carefully using the fishing rod and scarf he noticed that this was not bad after all.<font color = white>&#34;This was too much excerise jeez...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

As she stated as much, she took some generous steps back. <font color = white>&#34;Oh-- and slippery. I apologize in advance if I slip and knee you in the throat, nose, and or forehead in the process! The Officer&#39;s to blame. She took us everywhere-- even through a river-- trying to find this place!&#34;</font> 

One self-deprecating chuckle later and she&#39;s ready to give it a go. From the edge of the river, she fell into a sprint, her sandals clacking and crunching across the sediment, leaving a trail of wet footprints in her path. 

<font color = white>&#34;CatchmeCatchmeCatchme--!&#34;</font> 

She skips a jump, expecting the confident boy to give her the boost she needed to go flying up the elevation-- and to be perfectly honest, she had zero idea what comes after that, since she got a bit distracted! Wait-- there&#39;s a fishing line? 

If so, she&#39;d reach out to grab that and or the cliff-side. Whichever came first!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Two fishing lines then!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: Why are you surprised?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We can really speed this up.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: I'm pretty. Who wouldn't help me?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) looked downward once more, watching the others help each other before wandering over to help Try and the other Lad. He could at least pull with the bit of strength he DID have, even if it wasn&#39;t a lot.

<font color = white>&#34;Let me help, too... I&#39;m not the strongest physically but I&#39;m not useless at pulling.&#34;</font> The Uchiha stated, he got up easy but he was going to pull his weight in this exercise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) follows suit, but... The problem still lies in the fact that the punk never got the chance to swipe the Chuunin&#39;s staff... Oh well, there&#39;s always next time, plus, his sister isn&#39;t around to be shocked or poked with it, so there&#39;s no fun in taking it now.

Well, assuming that Komo won&#39;t allow him to even consider grabbing the staff unless he gets through the &#39;&#39;<i>teamwork</i>&#39;&#39; bit, he inhales sharply, calling out to the two siblings.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey! I&#39;m coming up after yah!&#34;</font> The Boy unveils his scarves, placing rocks between them to form a sling, he spins the scarves about before launching them up, <font color = white>&#34;Grab &#39;em and dig em into the wall!!&#34;</font> He commands, he wasn&#39;t able to gauge their prowess, but judging from the fact that they&#39;re up there and he&#39;s down here, it&#39;s a well aligned gamble.

<font color = white>&#34;Maybe these clothes weren&#39;t a bad choice...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: It was the exact thought on my mind.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (I'll RP after Yuuto)
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: They'll do anything for a pretty face. Poor Uchiha...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Fishing wire...Not what I expected from joining the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) nodded before removing the fishing rod from his back.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll cast down then.&#34;</font> he says before pulling the rod back, throwing it forwards to cast the line down the wall!

<font color = white>&#34;G-grab it!&#34;</font> he&#39;d call down to whoever wanted to ride the fishing pole express.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Someone's arrogant.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Wait... clothing...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well, it's only the first day.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: I this is only day one I ponder what the future holds.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t expect the girl to be wet, but hey, he would help her anyway. The moment she got close, his hands would go under her feet quite easily before launching her upwards towards Shishomaru&#39;s general direction. <font color = white>&#34;Next one!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is conversing but does extend over to clench the scarf between his fingers. He leans over and tugs, pulling back so as to give the punk at least some measure of a foundation to climb on.

<font color = white>&#34;Dig them in with what, stranger? No, you will climb and do so quickly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Isnt going to be boring.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) laughs a bit.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) unwraps his Kimono&#39;s sash, he could use this to help pull people up, too.

<font color = white>&#34;This should work.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Ah- Maybe throw it down to the lass helping people from the bottom!
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: ...Somehow-
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Mmm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) <font color = white>&#34;Hmm.&#34;</font> She lazily caught the scarf flung over her, and held it with not nearly the same conviction as her brother. She rolled over and laid on the scarf, trapping it under her body and between her legs as she scooted behind her brother, acting as an anchor to prevent him from sliding back, as long as he kept himself from sliding forward. It was a little extra weight for him, but...

He could handle it, huh?

<font color = white>&#34;Better hurry.&#34;</font> She called. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m letting go in fifteen seconds.&#34;</font>

Maybe it was her idea of a motivational speech?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) observed the given trajectory of the girl-turned missile for the moment, all the way to her zenith. The wailing was amusing enough it drew a gentle smile across her lips, but she didn't bother to voice her amusement in any way. Rather, she wandered over to take her spot after Hajime, waiting for his own leap to either soar, or flop.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes a deep breath.

Once Hanako manages to rise up to the next level of the cliff, he suddenly steps forth. With practiced movements, he leaps onto Yuuto and he is boosted upwards...!

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s go...!&#34;</font>

An arm extends, to try to reach the cliff-side, or Shishorama&#39;s hand... Despite the fact that he didn&#39;t actually want to accept her help.

Hopefully, he wouldn&#39;t hesitate in reaching for her and fall to a grave injury!

He was also wet, due to the river they swam through.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With an eager expression on her face, Shisho stood at the edge of the cliff, her eyes fixed on Yuuto as he prepared to boost the first person up. Her smile grew wider as she watched Hanako approach, pleading to be caught as she was sent soaring towards the ledge.

Shishorama extends her arms out toward the girl and catches her with effort. Gently placing her to the side, she awaits the next person to be assisted. 

This pattern would continue until every single student made their way up the 'mountain'.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (Shishorama, Hajime rp'd, you can get on that too
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (that RP  shall encompass all incoming students)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (very well, saves time
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Nice to see you here, Hajime!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (We got the double fishing line elevator up on this end)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (and 5 people pulling)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (So you can just poof up here)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: yep
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Why's what?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says:  Nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Thanks, I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: No problem!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hehe...! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) took her turn once Hajime was seen to the top of the plateau. There was very little fanfare as far as she was concerned, her movements almost painfully efficient. One might even have gotten the impression she could scale the wall rather easily without any assistance at all.

And yet, she boosted through Yuuto's assistance, and extended both arms to grasp onto Shishorama, the zenith of her jump only barely missing the height of the ledge. Perfectly calculated to be easy, and swift.

A nod was offered to the pair then, even if she had to lean over the edge a bit to show her gratitude to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) frowned without much to do in this case, it was mainly just watching as he trained with his chakra. it wasn&#39;t the worst thing but he was wondering what to do while he waited for people to pull up.

On the upside when there was someone to pull wwith five people pulling it asn&#39;t too difficult even if he lacked raw strength. As he heard someone whisper he&#39;d nod toward the Wandering Child.

<font color = white>&#34;Still would be easier if I could use chakra to help in this case.&#34;</font> He doubled down on that aspect.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Chakra..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gave a thumbsup to the eccentric girl after she reached the top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: meh
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: . . .Yes, Chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Alright!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) seemed entirely unafraid of zooming right into being tossed several meters into the air. An underdeveloped aversion to danger perhaps. Who knows! 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, wow. I made it! Thanks!&#34;</font>

After getting properly yoinked and placed to the side like luggage (with a fragile label on it), she found herself delivered to the next stage! A system of fishing line pulleys meant to lift them the rest of the way. Uh--

<font color = white>&#34;Are these really strong enough to hold an entire person? Eh. We&#39;ll see!&#34;</font>
 
As the designated crash test dummy, she twisted a double-wound grip around the fishing lines and held tight!

<font color = white>&#34;<i>O-kaaaay</i>, reel me up!&#34;</font> 
She lets them work their give-man-strong magic!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [five-man-strong*]
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Alright guys. In sync.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The ole HEAVE HO!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: This is wonderful!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: H-HEAVE!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: HO!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Goooo!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes steps towards the fishing line and merely observes for a few moments, to see if it truly worked exactly like it was supposed to.

<font color = white>&#34;Huh... This is pretty smart... If the fishing line holds, that is.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Heave!!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) began tugging back on the rod with EVERYTHING he had.

<font color = white>&#34;Lets do this!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) rolled his eyes, abjuring to their remarks. Though, it seemed they in fact weren&#39;t on the strong suit, food for thought he supposed.

There was an advantage to this feat, however; Shun&#39;Ichi was going to do something unorthodox to his experience: he was attempting to mimick Komo&#39;s Body Flicker, albeit with only the process of controlling chakra.

Assuming the lady wouldn&#39;t simply show him again, Shun&#39;Ichi improvised.
He remembers reading a bit on the tiger seal; the de-facto sign to focus chakra within the human body; Shinobi works was more his sister&#39;s talent, however the prospect of chakra control always intruigued him.
Time to display that feat in full flux; with his feet upon the wall and the centre of balance upon his heart--Shun&#39;Ichi placed his index and middle fingers on each hand together, and closed his eyes.
Five seconds pass, he recognizes a spark of energy within his belly, chakra.
Ten seconds now, each second is taken spreading chakra throughout his body, before sending it primarily to his legs.
Five more seconds, he feels a sensation unfamiliar to his physical body; and it provides slack for his heart, the chakra to his feet seem to be stitching him to the mountain.

Shun&#39;Ichi wastes zero time, he rushed up the mountain all the way to a point just short of the peak, he shifts around glncing at the Chuunin once more.
<font color = white>&#34;Still think I&#39;m not up to par yet?!&#34;</font> He goads, though while doing so, he recognizes a fault in his prowess: <i>Reserve.</i>

Immediately the boy scrambles his hands onto the wall, realizing how much strain he&#39;s just placed on his body with that simple feat. He&#39;s in a huff, relying on his own desperation and the Kaguya duo&#39;s willingness to hang on to remain.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Aa--Aaughh, these rocks are a little scrape-ish!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: But I'm fine!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) assumed Chakra was common knowledge and not just horded clan knowledge, taught to their offspring. He was probably  wrong but he had no time to explain before pulling with all his might.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled, trying to work in sync with the other four members of his moving squad. They had done the hard work getting up there manually and now some ingenuity would help with the others.

He groaned as Hanako let them reel her up without her own help. He was expecting the people to climb up as well, but with two lines it should have been possible.</font></font></font>

It simply hadn&#39;t occurred to her that climbing along was an option! Despite enduring bumps and shoving away from the wall where she could to avoid injury!
 
<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t act like a fish! Got it! I&#39;ll be as land-creature as I can be! Uh-- my hands get pruny in water, gah, I hate that!&#34;</font> 

How was she so heavy? Well-- she was drenched from, again, going through the river twice to get here! 

<font color = white>&#34;Wait--&#34;</font>

Ah. Finally someone said it out loud. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m supposed to climb? Ohh...&#34;</font>

She found a nice little set of edges to hook her fingers and sandal-tip onto and started to support some of her own weight along the way. <font color = white>&#34;Ah, hey. It&#39;s a little faster this way. You&#39;re really smart, handstand guy!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) sighed.. damn, that was a lot of energy he put into this. Looking up, he could feel his muscles starting to cry as he would need to get back up again. He had the stamina to help so many people, but even so, he hadn&#39;t thought this through on needing to go back up.

Well, that was his duty... and so, he starts climbing back up, holding back cusses every step of the way, but the time he reached the ledge, he was already extending his hand to Shishomaru. <font color = white>&#34;Need some help...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) scratched her head as the scarfed boy declared his ambitions. She indeed saw some potential in the boy&#39;s chakra control, however potential is just that... Potential.

<font color = white>&#34;Nope.&#34;</font> A single word was said, before she looked over towards the others still working.

She would look around at the class of students, seeing most at the top. She folded her arms on top of her vest as a breath squeaked passed her teeth.

<font color = white>&#34;I see that most of you understood the exercise. A lesson as well as a workout to go along with it. So, lets call it a day right now.

Tomorrow, we&#39;ll work on your mental strengths to go with your physical strength. This is the beginning of Chakra. Now climb down and rest up tomorrow. You all are gonna need it for what comes next.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Whew... T-that was something.&#34;</font> he says softly before looking back down the cliffside. Their eyes became wide as they gulped in terror. He&#39;d go slow, just as he had made his way up.

<font color = white>&#34;S-slow and steady...&#34;</font> he chants to himself in a hused tone, making his way back down the mountainside in order to get some rest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Eh, okay.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Ya see...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: YUUTO! THROW ME!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. ehh. But what if I break my arm? 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: This head of mine is extra hard.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) let the scarf begin to slip, but she mercifully doesn&#39;t actually drop it. The boy is able to make it up, and she realized this ugly-colored scarf.

<font color = white>&#34;You should eat less, fatty.&#34;</font> She jabbed at the scarf-wearing punk.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: It protects the rest of my body.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'd have to take a bath for hours.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Rub some dirt on that arm if it breaks.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Dirt? Ehh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) barely got back on the second floor... and was already getting yelled at. <font color = white>&#34;Throw you... where?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Water's better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) jumped off the cliff to the next level down.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes steps towards the edge of the cliff, and he glances down. After a few moments, he takes a few steps back and takes a seat.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah... It seems I live here now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Might, Try(Dancing Dead) has been knocked out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) points to the ground below. <font color = white>&#34;There!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: . . .!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: ... Okay.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...That-... Didn't sound good.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: Oh no.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ...?!
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: . . . He will be fine im sure!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Try?!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Try!?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) hopped onto the Lad's back once more, there wasn't many wways he could leap dowwn do easily yet. He was agile but he wasn't an acrobat, that much was certain.

At least not yet.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Smart guy! 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Ughooo...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Okay, okay. Here's how we get down.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I got this!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) stepped off the ledge, though she landed with a CONSIDERABLY more graceful &#39;Thud&#39;, on her feet, next to the downed boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you quite alright?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: We tie like, a bunch of shirts together, righ---....
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: You're almost as smart as him! Surely--
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Try!? Are you okay!?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh..
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: .........
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: He doomed..
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: ...Ouch.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) SQUINTS at the Senju and her superhuman abilities.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just.. put him in the river.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: THROW! ME!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Tried to roll...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Like parkour...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just throw him into a the river! He'll be fine.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hey, hey. Kurorama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) quickly pressed her thumb against her hilt of her staff, blood gushig out of her finger as she tossed her staff on the ground. Laying out a red carpet of scroll paper.
She slammed her hand against the paper as her chakra pulsed to the fiber.

Suddenly, several clouds of smoke would appear as several mattresses poofed into existence to soften the fall for the students.

HOPEFULLY catching Might, Try from falling completely on the ground...

(Kaifu!)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) shrugged and stepped behind Shishorama, his hands went to her waist and he looked at the ground. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you know what you know.&#34;</font>

He threw her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: WOAH!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: DID THOSE MATTRESSES JUST APPEAR OUT OF THIN AIR? 
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Dang.. Some of you jumped too quickly..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: ...Out of paper?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#884250>Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) begins to start leaping down with a final jolly laugh, clearly less worried about injuring himself when hes going down intentionally.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) simply stares in awe!

Was this....magic!?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) wasn't hurt at all! He landed softly on a bunch of mattress! Try bounced to a stop and looked around.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: That's a neat use of Chakra....
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi(The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (my fault pale I couldn't find yo message q.q)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (Sorry i should have waited instead of removing your agency chuunin)
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, wow. Rectangles. 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akiri, Komo(The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) OOCs: (LOL nah u made me spit out my drink
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) cracks his nuckles before also cracking his neck. Suppose getting to the top of the mountain had it&#39;s own costs...then he watches as try jumped down the mountain.

<font color = white>&#34;oh..dang...&#34;</font> was all he could mutter...and then Hajimi pushed Shishorama

<font color = white>&#34;CLIMB DOWN THE MOUNTAIN NOT FLY!&#34;</font> he yells</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) -- Oh, he was fine. She promptly re-absorbed all her concern. Like a sponge on a wet countertop.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Race you to the bottom, Hanako..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ha!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: What happened?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Did you say something, Kibo?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: That last step is a doozy...
<br><font color=teal>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I do believe you nearly suffered a violent re-arrangement if your cranial matter.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Of* guh.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) suddenly steps forth, allowing himself to drop onto the mattress! The cliff was, in fact, quite scary. 

Alas, he was sure that with the matress there, there wouldn&#39;t be any pain. Surely, everything would be fine.

He drops, to his assumed safety, but closes his eyes once he&#39;s in the air! 

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mon magic mattress, please hold up!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: Is that good?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) shimmied off the mattress to make room for the others.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I would rate that relatively not good.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hrm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) drug his hand across his chin at Komo&#39;s response. He gracefully knocked the rocks from his scarves before wrapping them across his neck. He was gonna gesture more of the fuck you&#39;s to the Chuunin, however, his ashen-haired compatriot&#39;s question stopped him.
<font color = white>&#34;So she&#39;s the instructor huh... And... Well, no not really..&#34;</font> He choked himself for a quick moment, if he wasn&#39;t attempting to impress her, then he just... Really wanted to know what was up with her staff is all.

Though all that thinly veild contempltation was snuffed out by the acrobat&#39;s twin, <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s called baby fat, boney, it goes away after you get older..&#34;</font> He&#39;d excuse, climbing up fully onto the mountain top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Well, it all worked out!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) <i>hurls</i> toward the ground with a smile! She was tough, she could take it! Or..so she thought! Just when she thought she was about to splatter against the stone below, a mattress of all thing materializes to break her fall. With a loud <font color = white>&#34;Oof!&#34;</font> Shishorama looks around, confused.

<font color = white>&#34;I knew I was tough...but this? It&#39;s unprecedented...what else am I capable of...?&#34;</font> The Senju looks at her hands, amazed by her newfound power.

The ability to summon mattresses....a truly formidable talent...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) hops down off the other lad, <font color = white>&#34; I still didn&#39;t get your name.&#34;</font> He stated brushing himself off as if putting his Kimono back in the proper place, <font color = white>&#34;Yet you carried me the entire way- Ah.

Nice to meet you, Rango&#34;</font> He noted, wrapping his sash back on to complete his appearance. His black eyes glanced towards the mountains, he&#39;d conquer the mountain eventually. Not today, but eventually.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hehe, and I was the first one down.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I guess I&#39;ll try.&#34;</font> he says, leaping down onto the summoned mattress. 

<font color = white>&#34;P-please don&#39;t disappear!&#34;</font> he cried, falling down the cliffside.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: That's it!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Trust in the power of fluff!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) decided to chill out at the second floor for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Be unafraid!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) asks: "Hey Shishorama, how bad was that?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Not bad at all!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) asks: Am I... D-dead?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I don't know.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We haven't exchanged names yet.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm Might, Try!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...Bony?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: If you're talking, you should still be among the living.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: I'm Sarutobi, Yakeru, i-it's nice to meet you Try.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) nods, releasing the scarf officially now that they were right there alongside them. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you should seek to prove something anyhow.&#34;</font> If only to at least make certain they know who they were dealing with.

<font color = white>&#34;You have a name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: ....!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: That's right, I'm alive!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Nice ta meetcha.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Bo-Ney, you're too skinny, and too tall.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: And.. Name's Shun'Ichi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) actually swanton bombs herself off the cliff without restraint. 

Oddly enough, upon colliding with the safety rectangles arranged at the bottom of the cliff, one could&#39;ve sworn her frame deformed like elastic. Only to snap back and toss her squarely onto her face. Eating sediment. 

And there--! She lay. Silent--
<font color = white>&#34;..aaaa--I think I was first.&#34;</font> 

--not silent. Oddly energetic, even, entirely ignoring the impact pains!

<font color = white>&#34;Were you keeping track? I, uh, forgot to.&#34;</font> She glanced over her shoulder to the red head, wondering if he managed to arrive undamaged. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Kedoiiin, Shun'Ichi.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Mmm..
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: . . . All this climbing made me tired...
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Nap time!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Kedoiin, -iin not -iiin.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Sleep well.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: This conludes today's lesson. Be prepared tomorrow.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had closed his eyes...!

He was simply unaware of her elasticity.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh... Kurorama! Who was first? Who won?&#34;</font> He questions, taking steps towards the Senju to stare into her eyes very intently.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Alright!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm gonna go train!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) says: Oh.. W-wow.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: .. Train? After all that?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: You should let your body rest.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) watching as the magic beds started to appear out of nowhere takes a sigh of relife. It seemed as if the Chunnin was prepaired for just about anything. Worse however it seemed it was encouraging people to jump down the mountain. Quick as it might have been he was not about to temp fate.

Stepping down back upon the earth climbing down would prove to be as much as a challenge as going up. yet same as before he climbed at his own pace.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I wasn't able to climb the entire way up without help.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I need a bath. My shoulder's all.. achy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) casually walked straight into the river.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: That isn't-...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Since I wasn't able to climb all the way up, I'll have to do twenty laps around the school yard!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says:  Yeah it is.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Clean. Ahem.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) looked at her body. She was tall for her age-- but that just made her age harder to guess. There was no beating the lithe allegations, though.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s easiest to dance when you are light and graceful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: What a strange name.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hot? Don't worry. A cold bath is fine too.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: You've never taken a river bath before?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That's true, the less you are dependant you are with your teammates, the more you can do within a team.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Tell us who won though, Kurorama..! Who landed first?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Very.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: What does Shun'Ichi mean?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: But injuring your body without proper rest will cause you to be more of deadweight for them next time.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hey, yeah! You pay attention to everything! 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I believe you both landed at the same time.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Ack! A tie?!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: ..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: We've hit the three together again.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: What a curious coincidence, isn't it?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It seems like it...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) snapped her fingers.

<font color = white>&#34;Brave one. How interesting. Are you brave?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Tie breaker. Let's do it again.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: How about we do something else?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I understand what you mean.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: STOP ARGUING! The answer is simple!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: -I- made it down first!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Take a nap, after your nap. You'll be stronger than if you trained.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I was thrown after all!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Stop buttin' in, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: This was between me and Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Like hell it's stra--! Oh, um.... I'unno, Mr. Senju gave it to me, not my mama.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Right!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) yells: Trust those words from a former aspiring althete!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I put my butt in however I like!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Umm...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Shishorama, chill.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: No chil! Only fire! The will of fire!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Does that not break an academy rule...?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I do!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) looks at the optimistic boy. The fat kid was clearly over three hundred pounds...

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, thanks! Believe it or not, I used to climb trees. My dad always had me do it because when I got to the top of the tree, the tree would suddenly collapse down! Everytime, isn&#39;t that weird?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Thanks!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) steps forth, and prepares himself to boost the fat. He widens his stance, and joins both hands to create a makeshift platform.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) agrees, <font color = white>&#34;All the time they do. It is their job.&#34;</font> It is what they are going to be doing, too. That was never a suden, revealed thing.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Beating the clans isn't nessesary for this, just make sure you don'y pull a muscle....
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...Eh?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) chuckled as he wasn&#39;t phased by the fat kid&#39;s weight. One way or another, he was gonna help them. <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry too much about it, I just hope you can catch yourself if I manage to do this.&#34;</font>

Then he looks at Hajime. <font color = white>&#34;You sure? I was gonna throw him so you could catch him, but that works too.&#34;</font> Unless Hajime changed his mind, he would start climb up. They can help the kid up a bit at a time.</font></font></font>

Just plain magistry?!

Nah, probably a form of Ninjutsu, some weird lesson or what not, either way, nothing he's interested in--Shun'Ichi begins to focus his chakra onto his feet again, attaching himself to the mountain slightly better than the previous time.</font></font></font>

Orphans did not necessarily get to eat too much and he wasn&#39;t the strongest. But he wasn&#39;t about to back down from a challenge...! Alas, when the fat comes running, he finds himself completely unable to lift them. Thus, he finds himself suddenly...

Crushed under the weight of the fat.

Just like every other person in his squad.

Mission failure.

She poked her head around the cliff&#39;s corner.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you okaaay, friend? Need the water now? Are your bones unsnappened? Or do you need a dip?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

God, he was tired, maybe this hadn't been a good idea.

Contact was made and he was the first one to buckle under the weight, even Kohaku who he knew hadn't managed to climb up by his own had managed to put more into this than him.

He was crushed.

<font color = white>&#34;Wanna see how brave I can really be...?&#34;</font> The boy&#39;s face imply curled into a crescent, holding her tightly while chakra rushed to his feet; he attempted to flare it wildly enough for the girl to realize he was attempting something heavily reckless that&#39;ll injure them both.

...It almost made her want to chuckle a little. Silly antics, though.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, right. Sand sticks to things..&#34;</font>

She pops a squat, smacked her hands in the sediment, and then wandered on over. Ready to try and help the chunky lad up, if need be, despite having nothing more than sand, noodle arms and a dream. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The fat kid-Seventh) The combined effort of the three wasn&#39;t enough it seems. Bloat Max was now on top of the three, opening his eyes as he noticed he was slightly higher off the ground with the help of the platinum blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah! You guys did it! I&#39;m on top of the mountain! This is so great!&#34;</font> The fat kid was thrilled. He quickly lifted himself off of the three, not noticing that he was barely a few feet off of the ground. He would run off overjoyed.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m definitely going to be a genin! Thanks guys for your help!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

There&#39;s a little unearthly grace and bending of joints as she bent in on herself and aimed to deliver a powerful strike to his nose.

<font color = white>&#34;Think you can insult me and get away with it?&#34;</font> She challenged, more of a brute than a graceful acrobat at this rate.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I think... my ribs decided to invert. Tell my family it&#39;s too late for me.&#34;</font> Then he plucked a dandelion and played dead.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, yeah- Good job, you&#39;ll pass in no time.&#34;</font> He stated to Max before playing dead once more.</font></font></font>

The strike was evaded only slightly, but the sentiment and display of strength was clear.

Instead of continuing to fight against the girl, Shun&#39;Ichi simply released her, pushing her body aside suddenly before launching himself away, letting her freefall the rest of the way--she&#39;ll be fine, probably.
<font color = white>&#34;The hell&#39;s got you all in a huff!? What do you mean I insulted you? What&#39;d I say?!&#34;</font> His voice was loud, but his confusion was genuine, in his eyes, the guyish name remark wasn&#39;t as hard hitting as she was displaying.

Oh dear, she'd happened upon a fight in awfully close proximity, and opted to skip backwards, over the edge to avoid coming into further contact with it.

It wasn't her problem after all.</font></font></font>

Had he drowned?

<font color = white>&#34;Ow..&#34;</font>

He rubs at his ribs after a brief moment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) yells: You're next at this rate!

<font color = white>&#34;Well.. I&#39;m going to head home.&#34;</font> he says with a wave, shuffling off into town.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Feeling better yet? You might need a longer bath if something's broken.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: Couldn't hope to win, so don't try.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: What happened?
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) whispers: It sounds a bit violent... should we intervene or let them do their thing?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Umm.. Hanako, I'm not sure that would help if something's broken..!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: Yesterday.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: The water does feel nice, though.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Oh. A chunky boy with hefty dreams wanted to scale the mountain!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Water doesn't heal broken bones, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: And, uh.. my friend here wanted to support that dream!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. with his fragile bones.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: That's okay.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It helps.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: It doesn't.
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) whispers: Good question...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It doooes.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Maybe it was in a magical hot spring.
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) whispers: I'm not exactly great wwith Taijutsu...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It feels kinda' nice, but...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You think?!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Maybe!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Well, I don't think my bruises will go away.

The advantage of Kamiseito distracting her allowed him to gain proper ground and distance between the duo.

<font color = white>&#34;No, I don&#39;t yah bonehead! Now hurry up and tell me so I can knock some sense into yah!&#34;</font> He proclaims middair, twirling a bit before landing on soft ground. That punch is gonna hurt like hell when it hits, but atleast he&#39;d understand why she&#39;s upset, and proceed to satisfy her bloodlust with a proper fight.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Err.. probably.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Kibo, Hajime.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: I do feel a bit better now, Hanako. How's about we get out of the water?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Sure, if you want! 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Can you swim properly?
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) whispers: Well... guess if they come down here, I can at least try to intervene, so let's watch for now. Shishorama is here so it mates it easier.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) scowled, as he narrowly escaped again.

<font color = white>&#34;This is your fault, Seito.&#34;</font> She mumbled, peering down at her prey with dangerous, red eyes. For just a moment, he received a breather. Slim, rounded shoulders rise adn fall with every breath, each one longer than the last as she stilled her racing, adrenaline-fueled heart.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) raises a hand.

After having been there for a bit, it&#39;s apparent that his fingertips had gotten slightly pruny.

<font color = white>&#34;It kinda&#39; hurts. Mm... Y-yeah, I think I&#39;ve got it.&#34;</font> He declares, deciding that he had to man up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) asks: Why don't you follow him then?
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) whispers: I suppose that's fair... Sadly I'm more of the Ninjutsu type, wwhich makes it a pain to deal with things like this...
<br><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) whispers: Your time will come for a moment like this. I'm sure.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: He's faster than me.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hrm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) snags that raised hand with her notably-non-pruned own. 

<font color = white>&#34;Out ya&#39; go.&#34;</font> In a few strokes of her free arm, she drags him to the shore, where he&#39;d be free to hoist himself out at his leisure. As for her, well, she exits the water and takes a new position beside the Senju. Over the course of about twenty seconds, there were no longer any beads speckling her skin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Today was fun, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: Unfortunate for you, loser.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Yes. I believe my parents would consider much of what happened today 'Quite goofy', as they'd say.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) creaked his neck upsettingly, moving over toward the mountain top again, <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t blame your brother for your mistakes, dumbass..&#34;</font> He affirmed, before climbing the mountain to reach her. She probably hasn&#39;t calmed down, but then again, what did he say that upsetted her so.

He didn&#39;t use chakra this time, getting the feeling he&#39;s going to have to recover slightly in order to flee again.

<font color = white>&#34;And can probably wear you out before you knock me out... Regardless, what did I say?&#34;</font> He questions again, this time showing vulnerability rather than defensiveness, being at her mercy while climbing, subject to any maleficence she may provide.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: My parents wouldn't!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: We learned how to use pulleys and, uh, throw each other. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Skills we will need in the future for sure.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Doubtfully.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) randomly chimes into the conversation and fades back out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) manages to hoist himself up after a few moments, with a few winces here and there. The fat had been extra fat, after all.

He&#39;s immediately twisting his shirt, trying to get extra moisture out of it until he glances at Hanako with a quizzical expression.

<font color = white>&#34;You mind lending me your towel?&#34;</font> He asks.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I had fun.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) tilted her head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Huh? Just air dry. It only takes a minute.&#34;</font> 
She said it as if it were common sense. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watches the dancer and the punk's interaction with some interest for now, at the very least hoping that there wouldn't be any violence among classmates. Unsure if it happened already since it was out of his sight before.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: There's something about being sore from hard exercise that just feels good.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I really feel like I accomplished something.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Er. Hard exercise?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Yeah. Scaling the cliffs.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) stomped a loose rock, sending a shower of pebbles down on Shun'ichi, his latest words only inflaming her scorn. She wheeled around on her brother, and weighed the pro's and cons of striking him, too. Her blood was boiling with the characteristic lust of her heritage...

They were lucky she was tired from climbing the rocks.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ah.
<br><font color=teal>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) side-eyes Hanako.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares down at his completely drenched self.

He waits approximately sixty seconds, before he glances up at her.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s not happening. Did you...?&#34;</font> 

A brow quirks.

Bizarre!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) did not speak further on the topic, her lips just pressed together in a thin line.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Oww owwwiwowwowowowow...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) was also questioning what he said, didn&#39;t he just comment on how they were siblings? Then she snatched him up in some weird sort of way, then he turned to Try.

<font color = white>&#34;You should&#39;ve been here to lift the fat kid that made my rib cage concave.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I don't believe she has a towel.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Ah, sorry Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Next time! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) although the rocks weren't large enough to cause massive damage, it roughed his tender child skin quite up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Hopefully, we failed terribly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) &#39;s clothing was in the active process of having moisture osmosised away. Formerly dark spots regained their natural color. Almost as if sponged away. 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, yeah. That too! No towel. Just air dry.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) smiles, amused at the anger, and the pain from Shun&#39;Ichi. <font color = white>&#34;You two are good together.&#34;</font> It&#39;s funny.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled his clothes back on.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: ... why are you still so soggy?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: That confirms my suspicion, Hanako.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Now, he was interested.

He stood there, drenched, while she was already dry. This was clearly strange. Were his eyes playing tricks on him?

He raises a hand to pat her shoulder a few times, before he attempts to gently pinch her cheek...!

<font color = white>&#34;No way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Oh, right. Thanks for pulling me up, Guy!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: Hm...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...You indeed have a strange thing with water.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: It's ah, Try, actually.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Try what?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Might.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: You might what?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Might Try.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: You Might Try what?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: What?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Try!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: Yes?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Huh?!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: YES?!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Might Try!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) snorted, and raised a hand to mask away her smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You Might Try!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Yes. You Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) turned back to the rocks and slid down them next to the boy. She eyed him one more time and made for a more comfortable spot to rest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: This is why I failed language class.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Isn't it?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Oh... I see...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: His name is Might, Try, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I haven't properly introduced myself!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ok but why are you dry
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) scratched the back of his head. Well, at least that didn't escalate, he then turned to watch the amusing sight that was Hanako trying to figure out Try's name.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No, Hajame. It's 'Try.'
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I've been over this.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: HAJIME.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hajime! 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: My current thesis: She's part sponge.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm bad at this.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Are you part sponge?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Huh...?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Yes, yes, I'm not an information sponge. Rub it in my open wounds!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) spun so that he was sideways compared to Hanako and stepped forward, getting a little too close to be able to say he respect people's personal space. He was grinning mischievously with his thumb jabbed into his chest and his handsome, masculine eyebrows (which he'd inherited from his mother) furrowed roguishly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The name's Might, Try! Oh yeah!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Hmph, fine.&#34;</font> The punk sidles back down the formation, heading off to go wash his face.

So far it seemed to prove his most difficult challenge yet.

While Hanako explained her own, in grusome detail. He decided to play along.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Hanako. Not Should Hanako. Or Could Hanaka. Possibly Hanako? No. Just Hanako. And not Just-Just Hanako. Only Hanako. But not &#39;Only&#39; Hanako. Hanako. The end.&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The Uchiha are taught to mold it at a young age to make fire.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Curious, the same for the Senju-- well, with Suiton, not Katon.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hmm.. maybe one day, I'll use ninjutsu too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Katon, probably. Cats are cute.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wwould nod before demonstrating a small flame in-between his hands- Nothing too significant but enough to be seen.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: My dream? Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Last night, I dreamed about swimming into a really deep place, and I found a whole mansion down there.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Easy- To keep non-nobles safe so that they aren't pulling more weight than they need to.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I suppose I would like to one day become the Hokage.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: There were glowing jellyfish serving as chandeliers.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: You sound like a deep sleeper, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: The curtains were made of kelp.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hmm.. you know the weirdest part of that dream?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: What's that?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I fell asleep in the bathtub.. and woke up under water.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Must've been only a second, but the dream felt long.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) thought about that as he crossed his arms. <font color = white>&#34;Well, that&#39;s a bit sudden... but for me.&#34;</font> He smiled confidently and used a thumb to point towards himself. <font color = white>&#34;I wanna become a Master at Taijutsu.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not really great at Katon... or Genjutsu... or chakra control at all.&#34;</font> It was a bit embarassing to admit that outloud. <font color = white>&#34;But I won&#39;t lose to others when it comes to my strength!&#34;</font> He closed his hand into a fist amd tapped it against his chest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Hanako, can you breathe underwater?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Huh? That would be weird. 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: You -are- weird.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm not a fish.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I can hold my breath for a long time though.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: Taijutsu, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Me too.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: How long?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I wanna make taijutsu that surpasses ninjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Uh.. I've never timed it. Like.. ten minutes?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ah, that's a rather good amount.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Ohhh! That's even greater than my dream! I should aim higher as well!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I get a little scared, so I've never tried any longer than that. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: What if I suddenly pass out?!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How do you even know when it'll happen?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: That's a long time Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Typically a case of your vision getting prickly, and your chest hurting. Followed by a sensation of fading away.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: You're like a dolphin.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh. Nope. Never felt that at all.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: A dolphin, huh..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) felt around her nape.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I don't have a blowhole.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: That's good.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Are you certain?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) gave a quizzical look towards his cousin, almost like he had to heads.

<font color = white>&#34;What about the family tradition..? Aren&#39;t you spooked of your parents being disappointed- I&#39;ve heard the stories of Uchiha that couldn&#39;t do their Right of Passage...&#34;</font> Kohaku was very obviously from a traditionalist Uchiha family, it showed here even more than his outfit.

Seems this was a glimpse of the Uchiha extreme high standards.

<font color = white>&#34;Then again if it ever came to that I&#39;d help you... just don&#39;t tell anyone, you know how they get if anything is less than perfect.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) lifts her ponytail out the way to let the Senju take a glimpse. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Nothing there.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. I think.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) raised a pointed finger to her chin in mild thought, her head cantering to the side.

<font color = white>&#34;Then my thesis is correct? You&#39;re part sponge indeed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I'm not spongy!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Some kind of clan skill I bet.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Ah, actually, I think I see it now.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I don't even have a family.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: A blowhole...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well you do now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) looked at Kohaku with an empty gaze as he laughed without any emotion, and then revealed to him. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m thirteen.&#34;</font> That meant he already went through the family tradition, completely failed that and was already a disappointment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I.. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Do I.. go see a doctor?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: What do I do?!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: You keep a steady diet of fish, and sea-jellies.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: But.. I don't like fish.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) asks: Pardon?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: They swim in their own pee. It's disgusting.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: But Hanako...

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Probably...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It only strengthens my hate for them-- thank you for clarifying.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Fish are exceedingly healthy food. They container many vital oils, and vitamins that make up the bulk of your daily intake.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Deplorable. Unacceptable.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Why do you think the ocean gets so salty?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Fish. Doing their business in there! 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: For a gazillion years! 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's a wonder it's all still blue.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: The ocean is salty because of millions of years of sediment erosion of mineral deposits within it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) stares at the Senju like they've just spoken german. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) dead panned towards his cousin... Oh no. He felt for Yuuto, he really did. Though he can&#39;t imagine that sort of outcast status, he had no words for a moment... only a long gaze of concern before nodding.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I see, living in the cold shoulder status... That&#39;s the worst, I&#39;d take up Taijutsu and Shurikenjutsu simply to stay away from the tension...

I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll pass their expectations and make them regret it as you climb up the ranks in the name of the Uchiha.&#34;</font> In Kohaku&#39;s family there could be no failures, even a late bloomer could become a genius.

Even if they would absolutely do far more than ignore Kohaku if he failed his Right of Passage, he would be put through absolute hell. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: What happens to it? It just stays in the ocean! 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: It's typically eaten by micro orgaisms, presumably.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: This could be a good training opportunity.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: To search the village! To race a four-legged beast!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: .. to the trash can at the rib resturant!

With a smile, he was back at full confidence as he gave pat to his cousin&#39;s shoulder. <font color = white>&#34;One day they&#39;ll appreciate me, even if only for my taijutsu, although I can&#39;t say I&#39;m just doing this to spite them and make them regret it.&#34;</font> He&#39;s doing it for himself as well.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Or.. do they?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Some canines can, but that one looks too small to climb.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) hadn&#39;t even thought about the picture. <font color = white>&#34;Well, not necessarily near a cliff, but just a jagged earth wall.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, dogs don&#39;t climb but someone could&#39;ve gotten him there or maybe a large bird snatched him up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Along their travels, she found the trash can in question, right outside the local BBQ joint and--!

With a paper towel bearing hand, she procured some almost-cleaned rib bones, entirely overlooking any repulsed stares from her peers. She went about, waving the bone along, calling out in her sweetest animal-baby-talk tone.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Fair. Maybe this isn't a problem we can solve today. We might need to just hang around that ramen stall until the dog shows up.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Might as well. Running around in circles is for the dogs.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: We gave it an attempt.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Well, at least we tried.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) That was it... he had climbed... launched people around, gotten crushed and then ran around the village. He was done, exhausted, and much like Hanako, he just plops down on a bar stool and raises a hand to make an order for the chef.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey chef, some barbecue meat, please... and water.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ramen Boss! One bowl of stock, please!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, and maybe throw some noodles and meat in there.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Vegetables too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: --yes, one ramen.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: He must have something in his eyes. He squinted a lot just now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninaest ninja-HoboCat) arrived schmoove as hell. Mans didn't speak a single word.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) settled into her own seat, though all the running around hadn&#39;t appeared to weather her by much. Senju were simply built different stamina-wise.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll have the double-udon with pork, a scoop of chicken, extra carrots, two bowls of fish cakes, and a slice of the day&#39;s pie, please.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly starts to roll around on the roof half asleep. It seems the smell of fresh food was starting make him unconciously hungry as drool slowly starts to slip out from his mouth saying.

<font color = white>&#34;Mmmm... Udon!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gave a hearty laugh when hearing Hanako take the long way around to ordering a ramen. <font color = white>&#34;Y-yeah, he must&#39;ve had something in his eye.&#34;</font> He wipes a way a tear. Damn, these people he met today were just too much.

It would take a bit before his barbecue as finally served, and he even got a new weird guy sitting right beside him.  He would keep an eye on him in case he was one of those food thieves.

<font color = white>&#34;By the way, what did you all think of the first academy day? Wasn&#39;t like what I expected.&#34;</font> He thought it would be all about learning how to fight and putting it to practice.

Hearing the purple guy on the roof, he made another order. <font color = white>&#34;An udon as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninaest ninja-HoboCat) seemed far too healthy to be a food thief. Though with that on record, it also seemed as though the ninja was so far-removed from the idea of a food shortage that the kid's caution would go unquestioned. 

The odds of the two seeing one another as weird were high.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) swiveled around in her chair, taking liberal advantage of its <i>spin</i>. It gave her prime viewing vantage for watching the ol&#39; Ramen Boss slap together their respective orders. It hardly took long at all. Everything was ready to be tossed onto the grill, if not already boiling. Minutes later? They were presented with bowls and plated morsels. 

<font color = white>&#34;Mmm..? It was.. very hands on. And by hands on I mean, like.. hands on rocks. We touched a lot of rocks today. I&#39;m not a rock person! I&#39;ve never climbed a cliff. But. I think I did, like, pretty good--&#34;</font>

She swiveled.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninaest ninja-HoboCat) was too busy silently ordering a bowl of ramen to be distracted by a mere dog. He would've had to have been a regular for such a feat to be possible.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) didn&#39;t seem bothered with the rather gargantuan amount of food she was suddenly served up. A double-portion of noodles? With triple the toppings? A double portion of fish cakes on the side?! &lt;i&gt;Dessert?!?&lt;/i&gt;

She settled in to eat her meal when she no doubts felt the dog mozy on up to the stall for a moment before absconding once more.

<font color = white>&#34;...Ah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Oh no, how does formatting work in rp...)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) saw the dog while taking a bite out of his barbecue, and upong following his cousin&#39;s gaze, he saw it. <font color = white>&#34;Well damn... let&#39;s go?&#34;</font> He was already up and digging in his pockets for money to pay for the food he bought. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m almost sure it was <b>the</b> dog.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly start to wake up from all of the noise as he would grogily look down saying to everyone.

<font color = white>&#34;Whaa... Did you guys find your dog?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) glanced between her food. Then the road. Then her food again... Finally, she opted to eat as much as she could while everyone else was busy discussing things... Just a few bites..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll take the southern flank! You guys handle the food!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) started picking up the barbecue, but not before downing the water cup he had asked for. He really wanted to catch that dog, anything that could put him ahead of Shishorama or the others. <font color = white>&#34;Not leftovers, I asked it for you. You&#39;re a loud sleeper.&#34;</font>

Anyhow, barbecue now in a box!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) selfishly took her bowl with her. She's slurping down the what she could while she waddles her way into the river. Yes. <b>Into</b> the river. She just straight up disappears down there. 

Bubbles float to the surface seconds later. An underwater groan when she realized her dastardly plot to have her own meal for herself backfired. It washed away, right out the bowl, with the current. Welp!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) shifted in-between the buildings to hide away, still munching away on her fish cakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was very confused by what he saw Hanako doing... just going down into the river with her bowl of Ramen.

Anyhow! The box with barbecue was placed in the middle of the street. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll go hide on the roof of the restaurant.&#34;</font> He grabbed the Udon and climbed up there, handing it over to the sleepy purple guy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: Dogs can't help responding to barks.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) sits behind the tree, surprised on how so far there is no sign of the Dog- He wondered how far the little guy wandered when they even left food for the pup.

Did the dog get that far already?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) socked a small-mouthed bass in the eye for getting too close to her. 
Nasty things. Minutes elapsed.

A need for air never arrived. Not like how the Senju described it. There was no pains in her chest. No stinging in her eyes. No signs of fatigue at all really. She felt nice and collected. Haze was the furthest thing from her mind. She's focused on the vague sensation of presences beyond the surface. So far--

<i>Just us. No dog.. huh. Maybe he'll come back when he feels enough time passed for us to leave? They probably have it down to a science, since he comes scavenging for food here often. He probably knows after people depart, that's the best time to find leftovers?</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly jumps down from the rooftop as he lands onto the ground making a small poof of dust before walking towards one of the stools as if nothing had happen.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) wasn't so sure it even worked. Perhaps they'd missed their chance for the dog at this time, but at leasy she hadn't missed her lunch-- except for the slice of pumpkin pie currently plated on the table in the stand. She was eagerly waiting for the moment for the op to be called off so she could greedily consume it.

For she was no longer in possession of any fish cakes, they were all gone.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) reacted to detecting movement towards the center of the road rather than the voices. She couldn&#39;t really hear much under the water. Her head poked out.

He nodded to the girl.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) accepted both!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) can be seen walking towards the bridge while counting a wad of ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm....Oh cool glasses.....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was crossing the bridge when he spotted the gambler, a smile appearing on his face at the compliment. <font color = white>&#34;Thanks!&#34;</font> He didn&#39;t know how to properly answer that, but still managed a compliment back as well. <font color = white>&#34;Nice robes, they suit you well.&#34;</font>

Then he remembered she was there when the Captain had showed up when they were around the ramen stall. <font color = white>&#34;By the way, now that I think about it, I never caught your name. I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> He approaches the girl and offers her a fist bump.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would look at the Uchiha weird as he begin to walk closer to her.Just in case this person was crazy she would tuck her ryo into her bra causing the twins to jiggle a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;Riiiiiiight.......Um it&#39;s cus I never told you my name.&#34;</font>she said while blushing at the boy<font color = white>&#34;Care to play a game for rock papper scissors?If you win i&#39;ll tell you my name,but if I win.....Hmm..&#34;</font>the gambler would size the teen up and down<font color = white>&#34;How about I get your shade?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) retracts his fist upon receiving no fist bump. Was she the more formal kind?

Resisting the urge to say that much was obvious to her first sentence, he simply crossed his arms as she suggested a game for them to play. <font color = white>&#34;Hmmm... so your name is that valuable huh?&#34;</font>

With a smile on his face he agreed. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, that sounds good, rock paper scissors. I like those odds.&#34;</font> He was confident when it came to his luck, although he shouldn&#39;t, it was terrible. He didn&#39;t want to lose his shades but this sounded too fun to pass up on.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) begins to laugh at her brother&#39;s underling as she would prepare her first battle of the art of rock papper scissors.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s duel!&#34;</font>she scream as she begin to shake her hand to confuse the Uchiha.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kumirama(The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) OOCs: (1 beats 2,2 beats 3, 3 beats 1

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was still smiling in confidence even as the girl began to shake her hand. He instantly began to imitate her, and to be honest, there was no process to his thoughts, this was simply about luck.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34;</font> Throwing his hand out at the same time as her, he had chosen to paper! His confidence, however, was instantly shattered when he saw she had chosen scissors.

And he theatrically fell to his knees, defeated! <font color = white>&#34;Noooo.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) 
A dark cloud would appear behind the gambler as she begin to laugh maliciously

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s mine!IT&#39;S ALL MINE!&#34;</font>she said as she reach towards the boy&#39;s shades.The clouds would now turn to thunder clouds once putting the glasses on.

<font color = white>&#34;So tell me do I look cool?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) looked up at the girl as his shades were snatched. As dark clouds gathered behind her and thunder struck in the distance, she looked truly evil! Still, he couldn&#39;t lose hope!

The Uchiha jumped to his feet. <font color = white>&#34;I admit it, you look amazing with those.&#34;</font> She really did, stylish, nice. <font color = white>&#34;But I can&#39;t simply let you walk away with those shades! I challenge for a rematch.&#34;</font>

After declaring his intent, he revealed what he would bet this turn. <font color = white>&#34;If you win, I will give you my Clan Jacket.&#34;</font> It had the symbol of the Uchiha on it, and it was pretty valuable, at least in his eyes. <font color = white>&#34;If I win, you give me back my shades AND tell me your name.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;What say you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;There There!I&#39;m surprised you don&#39;t know my name after being my brother&#39;s underling.&#34;</font>its clear that the girl wasn&#39;t trying to return the shades she won<font color = white>&#34;Deal but i&#39;ll need something in return.If I win you have to walk around in a dress.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: I mean sister.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Sometimes they can be super strong and I forget they/'re a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: But you didn't hear that from me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) turned red when he received that pat to the head, he didn&#39;t even notice her boobs, it still made them embarassed and a bit ashamed though. <font color = white>&#34;First of all, I am no one&#39;s Underling! I could definitely beat your Brothe-I mean Sister, yeah.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And it seems my jacket is not enough for you and you want something more extreme. I&#39;m not gonna lie, this doesn&#39;t sound like a fair bet at all.&#34;</font> Would he take it though, well, if he&#39;s anything... it&#39;s overconfident. He had already lost once, it meant he had higher chances of winning this time.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, I accept, but why would you even want me to go around in a dress? Are you one of those who just likes humiliating others?&#34;</font> Scrunching up his nose, he began to nervously tap his foot on the ground, damn, he didn&#39;t wanna go around in a dress.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hmm....

With that done, he snatched his shades back. <font color = white>&#34;Back where they belong! Now then...&#34;</font> He waited for the girl to introduce herself.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would fall to her knees as the shades were snatched from her.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would look gloomy as she was beaten by the Uchiha.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) a single tear fell down their face as they lost their chance of getting cool shades.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) felt no pity as she shed a tear. It was a shame, but these shades are his. <font color = white>&#34;Trust me, I never lie.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And yeah, there is a guy there.&#34;</font> He turns to face that masked boy.<font color = white>&#34; Raising a hand, he waved at them. &#34;</font>Hey! What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Are you scared?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: MWAHAHAHA!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Terrified.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Did you need to cross the bridge?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) gave a glance toward the crimson eyed gambler, noticing them getting closer as he took a few steps back, Keeping his distance.


<font color = white>&#34;Bridge?&#34;</font> He questioned before looking in the distance, noticing it before shaking his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Nope.&#34;</font> He stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) throws a pokeball at the teen hoping that she'll capture her a rare one.In reality it was just a balled up paper which said freeze.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watched the interaction with curiosity, the girl sure was an eccentric one. <font color = white>&#34;Welll...&#34;</font> He watched the paper ball sail through the air towards the dark haired boy. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re still lost, need help getting somewhere? Are you going to take part in the academy as well?&#34;</font>

He aassumed that last part due to their attire, some people like to dress the part, and he found that to be pretty cool.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Yea we can help ya.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: You seem cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, noticing the paper ball coming towards him, wacking him in the side of his face with no reaction. He blinked once, reaching down for the paper ball before tossing it back towards the crimon eyed gambler.

<font color = white>&#34;I...I am a bit lost and my parents told me to go to the...&#34;</font> He mumbled off thinking about it. <font color = white>&#34;The academy...&#34;</font> He stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) tried to run away from the pokeball,but adly she was captured.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh?I&#39;m Kumirama,it&#39;s a pleasure to meet you.Did your parents fill out the paper work for you to join?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) approached the boy rather than just standing to the side. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s always nice to meet a new classmate. I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> Then he offered the kid a fistbump.

<font color = white>&#34;We can take you to the academy, but yeah, you need the paperwork filledo ut. Should&#39;ve gotten to your household through mail.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: KURIRAMA IS DATING MY CHILDHOOD FRIEND!?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) glanced down at Yuuto&#39;s hand, raising his fist and connected the fist bump before rubbing the back of his head yawning.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you both, I&#39;m Kaito.&#34;</font> He stated before the looking at the sky. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah...sadly I am going to the academy.&#34;</font> He mumbled.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: What...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: They filled out all the forms.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Nice!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: So when class starts you should head there.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: It's okay I missed the first class too.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Maybe I'll miss it..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Heyyy.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Don't be negative.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Always think postive!
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: That would be a good thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would give the child a thumbs up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Positive would be me sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: And not going to class.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Sleeping is fun too.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: See.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Is this your way of asking for a slumber party?
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: We should all just sleep.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Kumirama*
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) asks: What is a slumber party?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) looked at the piece of paper that Kaito held but then his sights went towards small pebble on the ground. Okay, he could throw it pretty far... picking it up, he looked at the direction Shishorama was in and just tossed it while aiming at her. He was very likely to miss, but could at the very least make her realize he had seen her. <font color = white>&#34;She&#39;s so loud.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wait... you two missed the first day of class? I can fill you in on what happened if you&#39;re both curious. I took part in most of it. I got the gist of what it was about.&#34;</font> If they were willing to hear, he was up for a rather extensive explanation of what happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Oh?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hey, Kumirama!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: A slumber party is a sleep over.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Guess what!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) looks over at the strong girl on top of the building.

<font color = white>&#34;How did she even get up there?See.....i&#39;m convinced she has something supernatural about her.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) a single glance went toward the intense youngster before he looked back at Yuuto, the words processing in his head for a second before he quickly shook it and covered his ears, not wanting to listen to any lesson.

<font color = white>&#34;No...Don&#39;t do it..&#34;</font>He mumbled.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: But what happened!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Huh? What's going on?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Not sure, trying to explain what went on in class yesterday.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Oh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) smiled as she clambered down the building. Alas, she topples down to the cobblestone floor below. <font color = white>&#34;I got in a fight!&#34;</font> She roars as she lifts herself from the ground, unphased and unharmed.

<font color = white>&#34;I got in a fight and it was fun!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) heard the small mumble from the dark haired boy, and saw him shaking his head. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you only have to gain from listening to this kid. Trust me, it&#39;s not that bad.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;We just saw the Hokage Manor and the Fire Monument with some explanations from the teacher. Then we had to climb a mountain, the exercise had us helping each other.&#34;</font> They had formed a system pretty easily. <font color = white>&#34;We just made a system to help get everyone to the top, helping pull and throw people upwards.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t terrible.

<font color = white>&#34;Somethings will be easier by just relying on your classmates like that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) nodded his head a few times, pretending to listen to Yuuto as he kept his hands on his ears, blocking out all the noise, when he seemed like he was done talking he lowered his hands.

<font color = white>&#34;Wowwww...Sounds cool.&#34;</font> he stated, raising a hand to block his yawn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would scratch their head while looking at their sister wonder why she was in the streets fighting people.,but either way she was proud of her super buff sister.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah!I&#39;ll have to treat you out for some pork buns later then.....wait.&#34;</font>the gambler would wrap their arm around the Uchiha<font color = white>&#34;Heeey Yuuto wanna treat my sister and myself to some pork buns?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Paled orbs bounce from the group to the one who had just abruptly collided with the ground, clearly lacking the skill to land like a shinobi would. Her arms crossed, canting her visage ever so slightly to one side, <font color = white>&#34;Top of the academy, but landing like that... Hmh.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Was the fight with that red-haired boy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yeah, Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Dog..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Treat us to some pork buns!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was listening to everyone and was about to answer Kumirama until he noticed a familiar sigh. His hand was instantly raised and pointed at the dog. <b><font color = white>&#34;You!&#34;</font></b>

The lost dog, this time he was going to catch it! He charged at it! That 50 ryo bounty was his!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) ignores the loudness. <font color = white>&#34;Good morning. Most in the arena have fallen to the lull of sleep.&#34;</font>

She idly watched the dog, surely this could be entertaining if nothing else.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) did no move a muscle, it merely tilted its head to the side in confusion as the overconfident kid charged at it. With a dumb look on its face as he pants joyfully.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Is that your dog?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) gasped at the appearance of the dog. He casually waved in his direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Cute..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Hmm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) got in front of the dog and instantly tried to swipe the dog from the ground as gently as he could, because he obviously didn&#39;t want to hurt it. He just needed to catch it and return it to an old lady as far as he remembers.

<font color = white>&#34;No, not my dog, he&#39;s wanted though! He&#39;s Miss Kome&#39;s missing dog, apparently he goes missing every week. It was on the newspaper. Me and some others tried to catch him last night but we failed.&#34;</font> He didn&#39;t expect him to be caught this easily.

Yuuto had been sure this dog was the most elusive creature ever until now.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, noticing everyone&#39;s focus was on something else, a small smirk formed under his mask. First he took a few steps back then if no one noticed his getaway it turned into a full blown sprint somewhere he could take a nap.

<font color = white>&#34;Wow...what a cool looking dog...&#34;</font> he mumbled...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) gets her pokeball ready.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Oh, get him!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Powerful.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) froze in place, he felt a scary presence behind him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) rushes toward the dog in a manic fashion, clearly intent on having fun moreso than actually capturing it. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (yo dogmin, love your icon
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Looks like you found the dog, huh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) shrugged as she would similarly make her way over, arms crossed behind her back as she drew nearer and nearer. Caution was stuck to her features, as she didn&#39;t quite want to touch a random dog. That would get her hands and attire dirty - or worse... catching something from it.

<font color = white>&#34;It looks like it bites.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) was picked up without no issue. It seemed pretty dumb, just looking at all the new faces he has never seen before with clueless stares. Even with the intense youngster rushing at it, the dog seemed to have no common sense or any feel for potential danger... Or what it that confident in it's own abilities...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) yells: Urrrf!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: That thing is gonna bite you, Yuuto.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) <font color = white>&#34;Let me see the dog!&#34;</font> Shisorama demands as she attempts to rip the poor thing from Yuuto&#39;s grasp. <font color = white>&#34;I want to hold him!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) found this to be incredibly easy... either way, one thing was certain. <font color = white>&#34;So fluffy!&#34;</font> He wanted to squeeze this dog in a hug, but didn&#39;t want to hurt him. <font color = white>&#34;Let him bite me then, look at him! It would be worth it.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Nope, you can&#39;t hold him.&#34;</font> He told Shishorama. <font color = white>&#34;I caught him, try next week.&#34;</font> She should know by now she was not stronger than him, even if she tried to get the dog from his grasp, his arms simply wouldn&#39;t budge.

<font color = white>&#34;Now... Kohaku, any clue where we take this thing. I can get the bounty and treat all of us for some pork buns.&#34;</font> He nodded at Kumirama, he would get her those pork buns she seemed to want.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) was like a motionless doll as the two bickered for him. Clearly, he wasn't fighting it at all.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) rested her hands behind her head, watching this scene, unfortunately it was no where near as entertaining as she had hoped.. such is life it seems.

<font color = white>&#34;What a calm dog..&#34;</font> She observed the fluffy mass, perhaps it was only waiting for the right time?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) continues to wave at the dog, he was just happy to be there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) rubbed the side of his cheek as he watched Shishorama be herself, acting before thinking in the situation. At least this one did&#39;t seem to endanger anyone, just a puppy with a lack of survival instincts. As for  where to take the dog really?

He&#39;d shrug, <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know- The lady&#39;s house probably, at least that&#39;s what common sense dictate but i don&#39;t know where she even lives.&#34;</font> The younger Uchiha admitted, he was actually looking around through the town to get a read of the other areas outside the Uchiha Compound.

He&#39;s at least foud everything of importance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) fell asleep, snoring every once in a while.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) already felt regret at the thought of returning this dog... but he can't keep it... he can't.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So cute..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) would take a few steps nearer, squinting at the dog as she inspects it for visible signs of rabies or something. She heard every animal you see running around has that, and it&#39;s not pleasant.

<font color = white>&#34;Then it looks like you have a new pet for now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tried and tried to get Yuuto budge. He was stronger, sure, but he wasn&#39;t so much stronger that she couldn&#39;t budge him at all. She only two letter grades away!  <font color = white>&#34;Come on! Let me hold him!&#34;</font> She complains loudly.

If something didn&#39;t give, physical violence might be the only option.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) skips her way down the bridge&#39;s guard rail, using it as a gymnast would a balance-beam. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hmm, hum, ha-hum, hm, hm-- hm??&#34;</font> 

She noticed a collective of dog admirers beyond the end. And-- <font color = white>&#34;Hey! You guys found the always-runs-away pooch! Cool beans.&#34;</font> A hop sends her back to solid ground. She posts up in the general vicinity, deciding it best to keep her distance. Animals hated being crowded. Right? Right. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: You're gonna break the dog...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm not!
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) asks: Can..I pet him...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It didn't even try to run away.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just let him take a swim. He'll be fine after.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: You should bathe it.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I don't think it would stop you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) That was true, but damn was she stubborn! <font color = white>&#34;You know I would&#39;ve actually let you hold the dog if you simply asked nicely, right?&#34;</font> He just squinted at the girl as his arms actually began to budge.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s sleeping right now, when he wakes up, I&#39;ll let you, now stop yelling, Shishorama.&#34;</font> Now he had to treat her like she was a younger kid. <font color = white>&#34;You can hold him before we find the old lady or when he wakes up, until then,, calm down.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And yeah, Hanako, wanna help us go look for the owner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) shuffles his feet toward the sleeping dog, intent on petting it's fluffy head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) immediately relents and allows her arms to flop lifelessely at her side. <font color = white>&#34;Can I please hold him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So soft..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Is Senju, Kumirama among you guys?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's my sister!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Kumirama, Komo-sense is calling for you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was alive to witness this historical moment. Shishorama actually relented. She gave up on something, he had convinced her to step down. <font color = white>&#34;See? Was that so hard?&#34;</font> With that said, he gently slid the dog onto her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Sensei. We found the dog, where do we take him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I didn't even know you had a sister...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Sure. I'm the forty-first best person in the village at finding dog owners. I'll lend you my skills.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Oh. Give it here, I'll give him back to Miss Korme.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I haven't seen my sister at all.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Alright, Shishorama, hand the dog over to Sensei, then we can go for some pork buns.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hm. My skills say Sensei will handle the rest. Mission accomplished.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Good job, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I did my best! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah, here's the other half of the academy.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Yes, Batsu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) was a polite young woman at her core. She had no need to be violent against her friends unless absolutely necessary. To ask and use manners was not beneath her. 

<font color = white>&#34;Nice!&#34;</font> She says as she takes hold of the big fluffy boy. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s so fluffy!&#34;</font> She shrieks in excitement before handing the pup to the Sensei. <font color = white>&#34;Here you go, Sensei. Yuuto was able to grab him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Farewell...doggy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i love this dog icon
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (looks a lot like my dog irl)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Were you at the lesson?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) asks: We had a lesson already?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I had a supervised spar today Sensei! I did you proud!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: You mean the rock climbing?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) had no idea if Komo would actually be proud or not. She just assumed that would be the case.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It wwas mainly a team work exercise.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Well, how did you do?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I was carried up, sadly my strength didn't do much for climbing. I helped pull people up once there with a group.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) picked up the pup with her lazed eyes gazed upon the creature. It seem like she was all to used to this puppy, clearly did not have the same effects of its presence effecting her at all.

The puppy seemed familar with the Chuunin, easily hopping into her hands and climbing on top of her head as if it was one of its hangout places.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, Ko... Time for you to go back home.&#34;</font> She said, digging into her pocket and handing the &#39;bounty&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see. Unfortunate but shows true teamwork.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would clear their throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Soooo Yuuta what about those pork buns.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tossed the money to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, <font color = white>&#34;I hope we deal more with Chakra next lesson, while my Physical Strength isn&#39;t anything too special I can make that up with my chakra control.&#34;</font>

He was more than sure of that.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: We shall see.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: There goes that word again. Chakra...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) nodded at the dog, bidding it goodbye with a final pet. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we should go for those pork buns now-&#34;</font> Then he caught the money tossed his way. <font color = white>&#34;My treat! Let&#39;s go?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Kibo, you don't know what chakra is?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...Makes sense for him.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Heeey there, Maya. Who's your friend?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yup! Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh? No idea.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I think it's more becase we are from a clan, yes... It's an energy Shinobi use for Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, and even enhancing Taijutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: An unknown friend. I see, I see.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) approaches with pocketed hands...!

He briefly hesitates, but eventually nods a couple of times.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know what it is, no. Am I supposed to?&#34;</font> He questions, while taking steps forth.

He raises a hand to high five Hanako as he walks past.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, friend..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Where is the weapon shop?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It can be morhed into a physical shape if you train hard enough, too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Friend. Make yourself known! Oh-- hi, other friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I've been demoted from friend to other friend, it seems.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) plops his bottom onto the wooden bench, kicking his feet along.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hajime of the twenty ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: So it's energy, right? What's it look like?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Ah.. we my introductions missed previously..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) moves along with puppy in head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How goes your day?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It's going well! I just learned another piece of key knowledge that I need to beat the clans at their own game. This Chakra stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ha ha! Of course not. I miss nothing. Ever.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It's kind of bright, and blue-ish.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) missed a lot. All the time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) held a hand to her forehead for a moment, with a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Okiku. I was walking around the academy stuff with you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ohh..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I remember that!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Certainly..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) barely remembers what she had for breakfast this morning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah yes, this is Okiku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wwould make a flame between his hands to demonstrate, <font color = white>&#34;My Chakra takes on the properties of fire like all of the Uchiha- It&#39;s used to use Katon based Ninjutsu.&#34;</font> He stated before putting the flame out, the demonstration was simple but more effective than his explainations of it as a whole.

<font color = white>&#34;It basically runs through all of us, taking different forms based on the individual or in some cases the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hello, Okiku.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Fire...?!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: Yes!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) started make his way past the bridge with his friends. <font color = white>&#34;So, I don&#39;t really know any other restaurant or anything, but I love this place!&#34;</font> As soon as he plopped down on his seat, he could see the Chef already with a smirk on his face. He was always quick with a tip and an upbeat attitude after all.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Chef! Send three servings of pork buns our way! And whatever else these two may want. Some orange juice too.&#34;</font> And with that, they would wait.

<font color = white>&#34;It feels a bit strange to just pay for your food though.&#34;</font> He glances at Kumirama for a smirk. <font color = white>&#34;Maybe next time I should make you a bet for it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yakeru!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Join us, Yuuto's treating.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Hey, nice to meet you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would take some of the pork bun and would do a little dance because the food was oh so good.

<font color = white>&#34;Yuuuummmm&#34;</font>the girl would begin to blush as she continued to munch on the bun.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) smiled while waving to the trio.

<font color = white>&#34;H-hey guys.&#34;</font> he said before taking his seat.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) giggled at the little dance done by Kumirama before taking up a pork bun served to him. Delicious~! His expression instantly brightened at the warmth that spread through his body in this rather cold day.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Chef, another serving of pork buns.&#34;</font> Tapping his chopsticks, he pointed at Yakeru. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto by the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) waited for her food, kicking her legs around aimlessly while sitting on the stool.  After the food finally came, she obliterated the lot of it within seconds, not taking a single second to actually enjoy the taste. She was quite hungry after being busy all day long.

<font color = white>&#34;Mmmmhmmm! This is good stuff! Good idea convincing Yuuto to come here, Kumirama!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Don't forget Yakeru, Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -Oh, he's already getting food.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Must've missed you ordering it.~
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Laro!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Join!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (brb)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (I hunger irl)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) walks by the village with his hands tucked in his pockets, noticing a familiar voice calling out to him. Turning around, he&#39;d notice Shishorama at the ramen shop along with a few other students. Slowly, he&#39;d join up with them.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys. What are you eating? It sure smells nice. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) would place some change on the table, ordering their fill.

<font color = white>&#34;Pork b-buns please.&#34;</font> he said with a nod, they&#39;d then look over his shoulder, smiling to the one who introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nice to meet you, I&#39;m Sarutobi, Yakeru.&#34;</font> he&#39;d introduce himself with a weak smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Nice to meet you Yakeru.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) wets his lips as he sees Yakeru&#39;s food arrive. It sure got him hungry in an instant. Placing his hand in his pocket, he&#39;d get his money pouch, only to open it and see -- there was nothing inside, or rather not enough Ryo to get a proper meal.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh. &#34;</font> he mumbled to himself dissapointed, before returning the pouch back into his pocket.

<font color = white>&#34;You know what, nothing for me please, I&#39;ll just hang out. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d say to the shopkeepers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Have you guys already figured out what path you'll take on your journey?
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) asks: It's nice to meet you too... Uh.. What's your name?
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: My name is Laro.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Heya Yuuto.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) yells: Well, Laro. It's n-nice to meet you pal!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Can we get something else?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was just enjoying the pork buns through their time here. He had barely noticed the moment Laro arrived, another person to introduce himself. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, nice to meet you, Laro. I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;You sure you don&#39;t want anything? It&#39;s my treat.&#34;</font> He said that without really waiting for an answer. <font color = white>&#34;Hey chef, another serving for our buddy Laro there.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Sure, I still got some more money from the bounty. What should we get this time Kumirama?&#34;</font> Thankfully, as a street stall of sorts, this place&#39;s prices were rather cheap, and the food quality was still great.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would clear their throat as she slips the uchiha a list of food she wanted.The list contained three order of seaweed salad,ten chicken wings and some green tea ice cream.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) flops over the guard rail, entirely lacking in grace, and sploshed into the river. 

A minute later, she emerged, blowing on the recovered bill, trying and failing to air-dry it. A soggy set of sandal-prints were left in her trail as she made her way back to Position A! Lurking beneath the street light. 

Drenched, but the grin she wore says she's elated by her mission accomplished. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) had to hold back a laughter. <font color = white>&#34;Well, you&#39;re quite the glutton, arin&#39;t you?&#34;</font> That would really burn a hole through his pockets. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, but next time we&#39;re out eating, it&#39;s your treat, sounds fair?&#34;</font> And he wouildn&#39;t have mercy on her.

The list of food was quite appealing, and he decided to order it just to try some of those things as well. Thankfully, even if he ran out of the bounty money, he still had some pocket money as well since despite his relationship with his family, he&#39;s still an Uchiha.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Chef, serve these over here, please!&#34;</font> Sliding the paper to the cook, he just waited a little bit before food started being served, each one with a smell more appetizing than the one before it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s eyes lit up as Yuuto ordered food for him. A small gesture, but had a great effect. Forming a smile on his face, his eyes slightly getting teary, he&#39;d down a nod to the Uchiha boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you Yuuto, I owe you one. &#34;</font>

After a while another ration of pork buns would arrive, letting the smell fill out the area. He&#39;d quickly dig into his food.

<font color = white>&#34;Mhmm this is woo gwood. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d talk with his mouth full.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Back!)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hey! Laro!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Hey Shisho.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Eating well?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You should spar with Yuuto!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Oh no, not again.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You two are more each others speed!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) would walk up to where a lot of people were..

<font color = white>&#34;So this is where everyone went!&#34;</font> She would say as she munched on a strawberry mochi!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would munch on his food, now properly swallowing it before he talked. He&#39;d also look down the table at everyone who sat around.

<font color = white>&#34;Did you guys figure out what you want to do as shinobi? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Taijutsu!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would sway side to side as she watched her food be made.This caused the girl to begin to blush as sweat can also be seen dripping from her face<font color = white>&#34;Looks....looks soooo good.&#34;</font>The first thing Kumi would dive into would be the wings.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...it&#39;s soooo crispy too!I can kiss this cook!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) shook his head,

<font color = white>&#34;Not really, I kind of want to do it all....&#34;</font> he said nervously looking around, he knew how foolish it might sound aloud.

<font color = white>&#34;A generalist...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Kumirama.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Howdy?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Ku-
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: She didn't do it, I swear!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I've been with her the entire time!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks:  Ooo~ Someone's in trouble?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: If anyone say I stole their money they're lying!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) yells: I won it!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yeah, she has an addiction!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked at the crowd. Ignoring all the other statements being said.

<font color = white>&#34;Kumirama, I need you to come with me.&#34;</font> She eerily smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Can I go? She's my sister!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) puts down the food as he slowly turns around.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh, busted big time. &#34;</font> - he&#39;d mumble under his breath. But then it hit him. They were all noble clans so it would probably look quite bad on them, whatever it was. Him? He was nothing special. 

So he decided to step forward.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Chuunin, it was me. It wasn&#39;t Kumirama. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: I'm equally responsible for her actions..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Well... I'll save some food for you Kumirama. Good luck. We'll be waiting here.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Oh? I wasn't told about anything, I just wanted to reward Kumirama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) gulped.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh boy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) was about to run away,but an invisible force would cause her to trip.

<font color = white>&#34;Ugh....I guess it&#39;s a sign for me to come....Can I take my food with me?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn't think he could argue against a Chuunin when he didn't even know what this was about-And hey! It was about a reward!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Oh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh of relief.

<font color = white>&#34;Back to my food it is then. &#34;</font>

He&#39;d instantly dart towards the pork buns. not letting them get cold. Almost as if he had the Flying Raijin. &#34;</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Go ahead, take your food.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Bye, Kumi!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would take wings,but would leave the rest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) had a scared expression on her face as she turned to her sister.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Are you all set to recieve your reward?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Lead the way my good sir.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: I hope she'll be okay...
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: That was your sister?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yes!

<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Yuuto, I have been told terrible news.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: For a minute I thought she was an Uchiha, the way she has redish eyes. I heard Uchihas can have cool glowy eyes.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) thinks that it wouldn't be the same thing to eat all this food without Kumirama. It's not like he could save the salad for later without it losing it's freshness, so the least he did was ask the Chef to use his freezer. Placing his green tea ice cream there to share it later with his friend.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: That's something that takes time to unlock Laro, and it's not something you can just keep up the entire time I believe.
