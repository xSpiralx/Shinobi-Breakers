<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not pitying you. Like you said, you&#39;ll pay me back, so this is ain&#39;t charity.&#34;</font>

Despite his initial smirk, at the very least his tone wasn&#39;t demeaning. <font color = white>&#34;That aside though, nice to meet you Hajime.&#34;</font> Tapping his chopsticks against one another as their introductions were over, the chef came up and finally served them their food.

It was good to see the other boy digging into the food rather than flat out refusing it. <font color = white>&#34;You should take it easy.&#34;</font> He slides a cup of water near Hajime&#39;s bowl.</font></font></font>

Despite extensive contact with the lake, exactly as she claimed, there doesn&#39;t seem to be any skin wrinkling in her hands.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay! Let&#39;s head back.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Yes. You should see a doctor. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That's not normal.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) tragically had to come in contact with water a few times over each time she touched a fish, despite her attempts to minimise such a thing. Unfortunately, there was nothing that could be done to cirvumvent such an issue in the midst of her mission. Now that they were back, a small napkin was drawn from a napkin as she wiped at her fingertips. Intending to regain normality...

<font color = white>&#34;Maybe it&#39;s you...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) whispers: Nice Rod.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) held up her palms. 

Not a single crease brought on by liquid saturation was present. In fact! It appears her skin&#39;s moisturization levels were optimal. Perfectly optimal. As if she&#39;s just applied moisturizer ten minutes ago. It&#39;s peachy with a certain sheen, a glow-- 

<font color = white>&#34;Ehh? My hands are fine. They&#39;re hands. Not sponges. They shouldn&#39;t be absorbing water. That&#39;s just weird.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f8fe2>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) somehow got a letter from the academy delivered straight to her hands.

<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: Ask the mission man for the fish mission.

<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Is he alive?
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That was a nasty bump. Poke him with a stick or something.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Surely.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) grabs a stick nearby, walking over to the individual and giving them a gentle poke, checking for a reaction.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That was a death sound.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Is the ground okay?
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: He's taking a long time to take his last breath.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Death hasn't claimed this one yet.
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: --wow, so nice. Even as he lay dying, his concern for the ground is there.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: What a likely dead person.

<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Are you sure? He may be undead. 
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Then he can be someone elses problem, above my paygrade.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: An undead? I'm a cleric! I roll for initiative.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) asks: Is that contagious?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f8fe2>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) pulls out a set of ninjadice and throws a d10.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Probably. Don't get too close! 
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: What..
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) yells: Gah... I upcast turn undead to level three!
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Those dice must be what slum con artists use...

<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Well, it'll probably be more efficient to wait at the academy, rather than this shady guy collecting fish for money.

She seemed immune to the smoldering aura he exudes. It was beyond her comprehension. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Training of course! 
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Training..?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Training to be the best hand-stander in all the village?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: No, that's just an added benefit.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: That's goals.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: So kicks are stronger than punches, right?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Because we walk around all day on our legs.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: But if we walked on our hands then our punches would be strong.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: So I do both!
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ... I can't fault that logic.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Some kind of logic there..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: He might be on to something.
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Wouldn't that make your kicks weaker?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh. She's right.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Less leg time. Weaker kicks.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) turned away and broke out into a cold sweat as he began to panic. Would his kicks be weaker? He pinched his chin and thought it over as the color drained from his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) asks: Won't his legs turn into noodles?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: They're already noodles. Green.. spinach soba.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Simply crawl around, on your hands and feet, backwards.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Ah! 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I'll just alternate.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) smirked as she had caught the devil in the midst of a paradoxical crisis. A hand lifts offside of her mien, upwardly caressing hair before flicking it skywards through the fluorish of a wrist. Her logic was something that shattered him, and she would try to keep it up.

<font color = white>&#34;But, doesn&#39;t that mean... overall, your kicks would still be weaker? You don&#39;t give them one-hundred percent of your effort, as you usually would! But there&#39;s a trick to this...&#34;</font> There was?</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I'm okay with a little loss of power from my kicks if it means stronger punches.
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Or lift heavy things whilst crouching all day.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) asks: How will he eat?
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: With his face.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Faces are made for eating. She's right.

Her brow furrows slightly. Was the instructor truly expected to remember all of these names? <i>Tough.</i> A quick glance-around for that blonde rabblerouser was made, only for them to go undetected, for the moment.

<font color = white>&#34;.. Hmmm! Well, as much as I <i>could</i>.. I shouldn&#39;t step on any toes..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Uchiha, Yuuto. Nice to meet you, you seem pretty energetic. Much like my friend here.&#34;</font> They were by far, the most enthusiastic people around.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: How do I sign up?

He inches closer... Aiming to swipe at her blade the moment he's there.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) yells: I already gave you your 1 ryo back!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: I paid it back before the day.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: No way.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'll prove it to you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) would cross both arms ahead of herself as she watched the intense youth talking down upon the bright one. There was a growing smile of amusement which tugged at the corners of her lips.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know about you calling to everyone,&#34;</font> she directs to the redhead, <font color = white>&#34;I know I&#39;m above academy standards. I already know how to perform stuff,&#34;</font> she bragged.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A challenge?!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Of course I accept!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'm going to beat both of you, miss silver spoons.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Oh! 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: A match already?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I want to learn as many jutsu as possible, but I don't want to slack in other areas either.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) wipes an imaginary tear from her eye.
A budding rivalry! What <i>youth!</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) doesn't move at all, if the scarved kid tried to grab hold of her weapon, he would feel an intense shock traveling across his body.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I guess I'll start out as a generalist.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Huh? Someone's getting beaten with a spoon?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: A generalist.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Very cool! 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm gonna be a medical ninja!
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: What about you?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Really?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I bet I have really good chakra control.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Are you sure you want to try that?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You don't hear that often.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Sakuya Senju (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya rises from the wooden park bench, feeling the muscles in her back and arms unfurl like blossoms greeting the morning sun. She stretches her arms high above her head, her fingers reaching toward the overcast sky, as if trying to touch the clouds. 

"I should make friends now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: No, I'm just kidding.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: HA HA HA.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) extends her hand with a blaring smile. <font color = white>&#34;Shake on it!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I'm gonna be a taijutsu specialist.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I was gonna say..You don't look that impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: What!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Look at me!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Ah, right. I'll add that in. I forgot medical shinobi were a thing, SINCE I NEVER NEEDED TO SEE THEM.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Kohaku Uchiha (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) smiled seems he was the youngest here, although he was more dressed in incredibly formal attire.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Uchiha, Kohaku- I feel out of place being so young, So Yuuto and Batsu, both kin... I bet we will pass with flying colors then.&#34;</font> He held himself with a standard about him, confident but not one to hide the fact he was still rather shy. if one couldn&#39;t be true to themselves then how could one call themselves an Uchiha? 

He&#39;d whip out a fan from his sleeve shaped like the symbol of their clan to cool himself, <font color = white>&#34;I just hope everyone shows promise this year, in and out of the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) squints and tries to examine Might Try. He looks rather...Plain.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) nods firmly a couple of times, as his gaze focuses upon Hinoue before he reaches for Shishorama's hand, attempting a firm squeeze..!

Alas, he did not possess Senju strength. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: There you go, it should be there now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) was the living embodiment of masculinity, power, and excellent taste in fashion.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You....are kind of weird.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) took out a marker and quickly added 'Medical Nin" Into the options of specs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Guhhhhh...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) sagged, defeated and deflated. He took a breath through his wide, flared nostrils, then turned and looked over his shoulder as intensely and confidently as possible, flashing a cheeky grin and batting his thickly lashed eyes while smirking devilishly. A thumbs up rocketed towards Raihara.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Thanks for your support!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) pauses for a moment, does she not notice him...? This lady&#39;s a Shinobi, no? If so, then she should be able to realize her precious weapon is about to be swiped away from her at any given moment! Shun&#39;Ichi hesitates, turning over toward his sister once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, that girl&#39;s a Shininijobi or whatever, right?&#34;</font> He aims to clarify, since Sakuya&#39;s been outside longer than he has, perhaps she was present whenever Komo demonstrated some sense of skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: Never needed one? You're tha strong?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t seem to care about the formal attire of his cousin, not even their young age. It should be pretty standard for Uchiha&#39;s to have some geniuses every now and then, and he was curious as to what Kohaku was capable of.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh trust me, I spotted quite a few promising... if not interesting, people already.&#34;</font> If both Kohaku and Batsu followed his gaze, they would see him glancing at Might, Try and then at both Hajime and Shishorama talking near the police officer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) eyes did not change from his normal blank, bored expression. Was this some kind of prank? His cold black eyes merely looked at Try, unblinking.

<font color = white>&#34;Support? Uh...Are you feeling okay?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: OH YEAH!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: ou're not that strong are you?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Never better Raihara. Why?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Yes, legends of the village would say I have a hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Cuz today starts our shinobi adventure! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) delicately shakes his hand with the appropriate amount of strength. She took great care not to actually harm her future comrades and classmates. It was her duty to protect those weaker than her, and she&#39;d uphold that belief until the bitter end.

<font color = white>&#34;When I win, I&#39;ll treat you to some food after.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: No reason...Nevermind it.
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: It looks like it.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: We should meet some of the other students.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) Kohaku didn&#39;t look much younger than Batsu, wondering just what he meant by feeling out of place. It felt natural for the Uchiha himself to finally become apart of the academy after the years of waiting. He&#39;d nod toward his clan member though, a head nod that usually gestures a greeting.

The statement about passing though the academy would resonate with him though, he&#39;d already expected the academy to be something he could easily maintain as his parents had made him study for as long as he could remember.

<font color = white>&#34;Pleasure to meet you Kohaku and yes... We will indeed exceed in this years academy.&#34;</font> he said, smirking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: But there are so many.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) asks: Do you want to have a hard ass head too? Or you just wanting to give it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) clicked her tongue, and idly produced a book from within her garment. Adding a pen to the mix, she began to scribble down on a seemingly blank page. Mysteries upon mysteries were written, surely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Well, I can introduce you to a few.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hummm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) scoffed at the declaration that he&#39;d beat herself and the other one. So, she did what anyone else in her position would. Push his buttons even harder.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... I&#39;ll just verbally agree to beat you then, I wouldn&#39;t want to touch your hand...&#34;</font> Her nose upturns just a tad, as though she would have caught something being too close to him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) stepped up to Kohaku and put his fists on his hips as he stared intently at the Uchiha trio just... breathing... waiting.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Already making friends?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (dont mind my fists on your hips)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stands behind Try, his cold eyes just examining the three students before him. He would not make any introductions.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Medical Nin are quite excellent at giving hard ass he-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) reachs out and touches Shun&#39;Ichi green hair without permission. <font color = white>&#34;Is this natural?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) covers her mouth... She forgot she was with children.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had no idea that he had been held back on.

He simply figured that despite being part of the Senju, she was a girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;No way. I don&#39;t accept hand outs.&#34;</font> 

Despite Hinoue&#39;s clear reluctance, he steps forth and raises a fist towards her, to seek a fist bump. Defiant eyes lock onto her own. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ...And I'd never lose to you, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: ....... Don't worry about that! Answer my question, is that sword girl a ninshija?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (Does this game function like most nrp)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) had found themselves engrossed, reading over the orphan&#39;s shoulder.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m done with that page. Turn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yells: Ah--- She got away!

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You should really try to be a little cooler, Try.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Positivity is good for the morale of others, so that's a good thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) cocks her head toward Kohaku as she hears her name being mentioned. "You wanted to talk?!'</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) spared a glance over toward Komo. Upon realizing that the older woman was insistent on tomorrow&#39;s start date, she clicks her tongue. Stepping further down the path, she turns her attention out toward the gathering.

<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) saw Might Try approaching that the Hatake kid from before. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> He extend a fist for a bump. <font color = white>&#34;Hatake, Raihara, right?

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Wait-- did the lady with a normal sized vocabulary say something about money?
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: You wasted my time! I was gonna swipe her sword and everything, give it a swing or four...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: We're surrounded by great future ninja! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: My vocabulary is above-average!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: She did indeedf.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: . . Probably..!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Ah nevermind.. Doesn't matter.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (So day 1 might try wipe)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I'll play, Kyoko-sensei..!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: You should have been faster.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Batsu(The reserved preteen-Green345) OOCs: ( Yep
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I do hope so, though I also hope you don't stress yourselves too much and die.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) pondered the reply for a moment before nodding along. Another something was scribbled in her book.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (And I get a hatake to be my hot blooded rival)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: -
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (this might be The Wipe)
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll play your game, cop with the chunky vocabulary, yet normal sized words. 
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Shaddup, stupid slow speaking ass.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) calls her Sensei in an attempt to manipulate her into teaching them an illicit class. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Excellent--.. ah, hm. That doesn't sound right either..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Her statement seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as the optimistic one rapidly approached with a fist held out, intent on connecting some type of gesture that was evidently foreign to her with the confusion crawling across her visage. So, what could she do except from taking an offensive stance?!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to fight me right now?&#34;</font>

Legs set further apart, bending ever so slightly at the knees as all digits furl upon both hands - only for the index and middle to extend in an untrained stance. Unique to her lineage.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: D-do you sheltered nobles not even know what a fist bump is?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (hey, Try, you're more experienced with taijutsu than me, any tips on what stats to focus?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) looks at Yuuto Uchiha. He examines the boy quickly, taking note of his features and disposition. He would too extend his fist and connect with Yuuto&#39;s own.

<font color = white>&#34;Hatake, Raihara.&#34;</font> , he said plainly, matter of factly before turning his attention to Kohaku, examing him as well.

<font color = white>&#34;A pleasure to meet you both. I look forward to learning with you at the academy.&#34;</font>, he would say.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (As an Uchiha specifically?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (yes
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (Max out Agility always)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (let's say a stat caps at 22)
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Game. Gaaaame!

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (So be aware of caps and don't waste points)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: H-Hey! It's a game that was for, like- a few people!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (look at the tai tree. we gain some strength from adept and master)
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: If no one wants to play, you'll have to wait 'til later.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares at Hinoue. 

Far from impressed with her polished combat stance that had been handed down across generations, he seems shocked, apalled even. He leans back a tad, as if now -he- were the one who could catch something from her.

He turns to face Kyoko on that note, and takes a step away from the Hyuuga, turning his back towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll play.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (i can explain more in discord)

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Is this enough? 
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: Tch... I'm gonna go play that game, yah comin'?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: Hmm..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: If need be, I can summon an entire army at a moment's notice.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I thnk I am fine.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hatake, Raihara(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (are caps the same here?)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Gorumba, Maya(The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) OOCs: (even worse when Uchiha always had E end no matter what

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: So, yes- this is enough, if no one else wants to.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Your fellow brothers and sisters, who all happen to be the sons and daughters of Konoha's fishermen?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You're on!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: Wait-!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ahem. Handstand guy! Orphan girl! Uh-- regal girl with the wrinkled hands!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: That's me!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Get over here! We're playing a game with a cop for money!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: And, uh, anyone else who might wanna. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) huffed as he seemed to recoil from her, <font color = white>&#34;Must be fear...&#34;</font> That was a confidence boost to her secret training.--

<font color = white>&#34;-Oh?&#34;</font> She looks to the &#39;cop&#39; in question, <font color = white>&#34;Okay.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: I must sit out of this one, I did not gain my fancy clothing by gambling.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Are you two actually about to fight...?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I bet she's got fine money.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) looks at the group unblinking, his mind slightly excited at the mention of money.

<font color = white>&#34;I too would like to join.&#34;</font>, he said.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Littering money.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;La~me. Well, if the prize is something I can share, I won&#39;t give yah some.. So watch me win, okay?&#34;</font> The kid trudged through the crowd of Uchiha and Konoha&#39;s finest clones, making haste to Kyouko&#39;s request.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, milk-eyes, what&#39;s the game like?&#34;</font> He initiated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I doubt it's gambling. She's an officer of the law!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) feels a twinge in her heart, forced to recoil at the girl&#39;s statement. Somehow, she made it sound a lot worse than it actually was..
<font color = white>&#34;.. Something like that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) wraps their arm around the intense youngster.

<font color = white>&#34;Soooo how&#39;s it going?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: Gambling would imply you have something to lose!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: She's a good person who would neve--
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) holds up one-hundred ryo.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Hmm?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I have my life savings.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: A--.. put that away.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: You wouldn't take that, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: No.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares at the hundred ryo like a revenous, starving dog would stare at a piece of juicy steak.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: See? She's safe, Orphan-comrade! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, this was a fine day- Though they weren&#39;t nobles he&#39;d hope for the two to fair well in the academy, it&#39;s not that he looked down on them. It was simply instilled at a young age he was to protect them, simply because the nobles were born with strong traits and nothing more. Mental conditioning was strong in this one, though he wasn&#39;t ruled by it.

<font color = white>&#34;I do, too... Just don&#39;t push yourselves too much, hard work is fine until you pull a muscle. It happens to everyone eventually.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: There's always something to lose. Dignity. Pride. Reputation. Though losing these aren't exclusive to gambling I suppose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) walks up to the platinum blonde girl

<font color = white>&#34;Wooow that&#39;s alot of money hehehe.....what do you plan on doing with it?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'unno. Probably buy things I want. 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Could give it to me.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Or maybe learn how to do that one trick to make a bill disappear. 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Just a thought.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) nimbly steps backward, putting some space between herself and the blonde. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hoh-kay. Whoever wants to play, line up on either side of the wealthy blonde!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Kohaku's right.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That's too easy a way to make a bill disappear.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: That's whys tretching is important.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Indeed.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah she's gone.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: So what's the game?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: We're lining up! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hm, hm..! You follow instructions well.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm unbeatable at anything except a language test.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Do your worst!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You're about to be proven wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh yeah? Spell charcuterie.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Shadduuuup, let her explain.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Uh.. s-h-a-r-k-u-t-a-i-r. 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: These type of games aren't my cup of tea.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Hey, Kurorama and Yuuto! You should play, too...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) quietly slips into the line.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: What type?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Group games.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) <font color = white>&#34;The rules are simple! I&#39;ll be asking a question, and whoever answers correctly first gets to step forward. First one to pass-&#34;</font> 
A pause, as she drags her foot along the dirt to make a makeshift line.
<font color = white>&#34;- this spot here, wins. Ah- and if you give an incorrect answer, whether you&#39;re first or not, you have to step backwards. The winner will receive.. ryo! Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Interesting...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: No questions, let's begin..!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Verily.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5a5a8c>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) Being quite content with keeping to himself, the last thing he anticipated was someone waltzing up to strike a conversation. After all, given the circumstances, he figured most folks around were probably younger than him. It was a tough pill to swallow, being on the older side yet perched on such a low position of the shinobi ladder.

Still, he managed to conjure up a sheepish grin in return, refusing to let rudeness take over. <font color = white>&#34;Kaoru.&#34;</font> He replied, giving a brief introduction..</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) attempts to take a step forth, as he was the first one who answered a question. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No questions. Only answers.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) asks: What about my questions?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Your questions. My answers.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Step forward.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) takes a bold step foward.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Heh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I see, I understand now.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) takes note of Kibo&#39;s deftness. To think, he took advantage of the situation so quickly..!
<font color = white>&#34;Ap-ap. You didn&#39;t answer a question- back up.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) is notorious for not listening to commands, so he rebelliously steps backward.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: No way..!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: Not you- this one!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: She means this girl here. 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Oh.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Hrm...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Wait.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Can I ask a question?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) asks: Sure. What's your question?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I wanna understand.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Step forward.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: His question is he wants to understand.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: If we get the answer right we step forward.

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hey. hey. Kyoko-sensei. Ask me what my name is. 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) asks: How many questions have I asked since we started?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Four.

<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Including that question just then.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) All the students gathered infront of the Konohagakure memorial, the woman reached behind her to grip her hand against the &#39;weapon&#39;. A fancy stick with several tags around it.
  She pulled out an attachment, a small spade like object that she wiggled into place on the top of her staff. The tool now resembles a hoe.

<font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Konoha&#39;s academy course. Ya&#39;ll be training to be shinobi that defends the lands of Fire, we shinobi are the heartline of this nation - Just like farmers.&#34;</font>

 Komo tosses her hoe hard towards the dirt behind the students, piercing and parting the dirt with force.

<font color = white>&#34;Instead of feeding mouths, we shinobi solves and prevent those farmer&#39;s problems from interrupting them making harvest.&#34;</font>

A hand extended facing the handed tool, as it suddenly came back to her grasp. <font color = white>&#34;To do that, we practice and master the use of all life force Chakra. Before we git to all that...&#34;</font>

The woman places the hoe back to her rear, facing the memorial.

<font color = white>&#34;This memorial is what we call tribute, tribute to all the shinobi that has succeeded their limits for their nation, some giving up their lives for you to even breathe and be born. The Will of Fire. If you disrespect this, you&#39;re disrespecting your births. Ya&#39;ll remember that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Ah well, no matter; it's nost necessarily a priority on his list. If it's necessary, he'll simply claim that the instructor forgot him or something along those lines.

Either way, he snuggles up in his clothing, overhearing Komo's words intently.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) cleared his throat and immediately put on a more calm expression when the teacher began to address the gathering of students. The farmer analogy caught him by surprise... but slowly, he nodded in understanding. Still, to be compared to a farmer was a bit... nevermind that. It was fair.

His focus then shifted to the Tribute memorial... and he became a little more serious, even though the situation between Shishorama and the other Hyuuga was anything but that in his eyes.</font></font></font>

Snail's pace indeed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With a wide grin on her face, Shishorama observes Lero as he approaches her at speeds unattainable to herself, moving like lightning! She finds it challenging to keep pace with his stride, but meets him in the middle nontheless. 

Winding back a fist, she aims to clock Laro in the jaw!</font></font></font>

He awaits the boy&#39;s response as the intense youngster appears to launch the first strike. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s see what he does now.&#34;</font> The sharp-toothed boy&#39;s arms fold, observant in stance.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) saw Shishorama close the gap between the two, now finally getting into striking range. About time their tiny little arms could see some action. She cocked her fist, launching it straight for his jaw.

Fortunately, the boy would lift his hands up infront of his face, letting his forearms take the brunt of the attack. His technique was rather lousy, to say th least.

As her attack ended it was time for his own, launching a counter-attack of his own, cocking his hand and sending it towards her gut.

As hardy and braggadocious as she was, she had little practice in the real art of battle, and lacked the capability to back up her talk with skill alone. Indeed, she was outclassed in every regard!

Still, she just barely manages a block and swings at Laro&#39;s chin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, this is close! I don&#39;t think I can beat you yet!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would once again attempt to evade the attack, this time ducking under attack. He'd quickly answer right back with a hit of his own, trying to once again hit at her body.

The girl&#39;s eyes bug out as the pain spreads through her abdomen. Strangely enough, her smile only grows. As his fist smashes into her body, could feel her sturdy frame harden as if preparing for the blow. She was well on her way to developing a tough physique, unfortunately she just wasn&#39;t there yet.

<font color = white>&#34;That was a good one!&#34;</font> She exclaims wildly as she throws yet another sloppy punch to the other&#39;s face!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) looked back at the wandering child- a wave tossed his way.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Some of the students wanted to get some practice before classes start.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) could feel that she was suprisingly sturdy compared to his hits, perhaps something he neeed to work on in due time. Yet he landed a hit, none-the-less. But it didn't seem like it slower her down much as she launched another attack right back at him.

Once again he managed to block it, but surely his ability to block shots was running out.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) smiled as he was informed he wasn&#39;t late.

<font color = white>&#34;Whew... Thank goodness.&#34;</font> he says, returning a wave towards the police chef now. They&#39;d then look on to the sparring match, observing the two going at it as he relaxed with the others.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, t-that sounds good.&#34;</font> he said, hoping to see what he might pick up from their match.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) he also punched her back.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With a swift movement, Shishorama brings her forearm up to deflect Laro's incoming strike. In a split second, she turns the tables and attempts to deliver a powerful blow to his sternum, showcasing her tenacity and grit despite her lack of refined martial prowess. Her unyielding spirit and unwavering determination serve as her greatest weapon, allowing her to hold her own against even the most skilled opponents.

His folded arm stance remains. The teen shifts to stand the amber-haired boy.

And it was quite a strong one, as she managed to hit him right into his sternum with a rather powerful punch. It knocked the air out of him, causing him to hunch over a bit, sustaining rather heavy injury.

As he held his stomach, it was quite evident, one of those would probably put him out of the commission.

He could probably land a few more hits on her but would it be enough? Probably not.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tossed the money to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, <font color = white>&#34;I hope we deal more with Chakra next lesson, while my Physical Strength isn&#39;t anything too special I can make that up with my chakra control.&#34;</font>

He was more than sure of that.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Kibo, you don't know what chakra is?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...Makes sense for him.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I think it's more becase we are from a clan, yes... It's an energy Shinobi use for Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, and even enhancing Taijutsu.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) approaches with pocketed hands...!

He briefly hesitates, but eventually nods a couple of times.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know what it is, no. Am I supposed to?&#34;</font> He questions, while taking steps forth.

He raises a hand to high five Hanako as he walks past.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, friend..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Where is the weapon shop?

<font color = white>&#34;It basically runs through all of us, taking different forms based on the individual or in some cases the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hello, Okiku.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Here are some people at least.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It does cook delicious food.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Are you asking me?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'll find a way to do it, that doesn't involve me losing an arm.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just put some water on it.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Water does seem to solve a lot of problems for you, huh?

<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Is that true?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Look at him.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: She's a liar.

<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: She mentioned something about them having hard ass head.

<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: If I fail, then I can sleep as much as I want.

<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: No...they wouldn't..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Keep runnin' your mouth. I can't wait to hear how you had to explain that someone not from a clan got better academy grades than you to your parents.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Isn't that right, Sensei?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Failures have to take make-up classes!

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Lots of talking...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I don't think make up classes would be needed, if you just got it right the first time.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ...but there is make up if you do fail then.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) yells: See, I've never had to do any make up classes!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t fail.&#34;</font>

A smile given towards the old Shinobi before dropping her voice lower in a whisper, but still audible to all those around if they listened.

<font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s more where that&#39;s from if I pass with straight A grades.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Hanako, how well do you think you'll do?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: See? The first step's already here. Sign up to join the Academy with Sensei--
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Does success equal sleeping..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I did, I see your name here.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I'm Kaguya...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) looks away. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll do good,&#34;</font> she murmured, lying through her teeth. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I look forward to see you top of the class.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: y-Yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ha ha.. haaa..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: If you don't we'll help you pass.... Somehow.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked at the single ryo as she simply threw it into the river.

<font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t no wishing well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) crossed her arms as she turns to walk past Hajime, briefly sticking her tongue out before halting closer to the others, <font color = white>&#34;I think I&#39;ll have a better time watching you open your grades and hide from me afterwards. Because you did worse.&#34;</font> She had to clarify that last part... Obviously.

<font color = white>&#34;My clan only excels and succeeds after all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) leaned back up, staring at the sky before sighing.

<font color = white>&#34;I will get my family back for this...&#34;</font> He mumbled, raising a single fist in the air.,</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Seems they are doing the bonding.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) raised a single eyebrow, slipping into her pouch as she removes a wad of of over three-hundred ryo. In a hushed voice she spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;So, what&#39;s the price then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked over at the blissful youth.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you Kumirama?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I'm rich.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I have no price.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Kumirama is not over here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) squints, and soon clenches a fist..! Her gesture draws a slightly reddened face from the young man, in frustration.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll see about that.&#34;</font>

He turns away from her, and soon forces a smile as he takes steps towards the two girls in the distance.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. I&#39;m Hajime. Nice to meet you both.&#34;</font>

A single fist extends forth, towards them. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Prove you're rich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looks at her fancy clothes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) with a sigh she&#39;d instead remove the largest fish she had recently caught, handing it over towards the instructor before stepping back next to Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do great at school, teacher.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Hm... Acceptable.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: She does look rich.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Hey, hey. Komo-sensei. How'd you get rich?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) glanced left. 
She glanced right.

It looks like the coast was clear. As long as she ignored the twenty eyeballs within the vicinity. Conditions were perfect. She tip-toed her way over to the guard rail. 

<i>Aaaand</i> slowly started to climb over the obstacle. Her eyes were glued to that discarded single ryo bill. She could buy some candy with that. What a waste! To let it flow away on the current!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Hm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) grabs the raw fish that was given to her by the kombu green haired girl. She savagly bite into the raw fish in its mid section, devouring everything until stuffing the rest of the fish into her mouth, tail end last.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) wasn't sure if she should be frightened or impressed by the display.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) bumped a swollen fist against his.

<font color = white>&#34;Kamiya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Working hard is a good start. Finding more doors to make money.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Being born rich helps too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;I am Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font> She turns to the bright boy and extends her hand. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you as well, Hajime.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's your fist swollen?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) watched Hanako go after the ryo, he didn't care- No one else seemed to care, therefore it was fair game for the Platinum Blonde to go fishing for it. Though he stopped staring to wwatch the Headmistress become a savage and potentially poison herself  to mortify Children.

It seemed to be working.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) does not notice the antics of the headmistress, nor the missed opportunity of nabbing 1 ryo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, watching how the women just devoured a raw fish, He thought for a second, Just staring at her before nodding.

<font color = white>&#34;Do all girls eat like?&#34;</font> He questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Not girls, but real women.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Impressive.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) flops over the guard rail, entirely lacking in grace, and sploshed into the river. 

A minute later, she emerged, blowing on the recovered bill, trying and failing to air-dry it. A soggy set of sandal-prints were left in her trail as she made her way back to Position A! Lurking beneath the street light. 

Drenched, but the grin she wore says she's elated by her mission accomplished. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I pulled my finger out.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Entirely.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's bad.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You shouldn't do that.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I think you could win a eating competition.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Then she poked Shishorama with the bone.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't think it is as bad as it seems.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hard core.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Good work, Hanako. Stealth is a virtue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: w-- You saw?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) steps away on that note, shuddering, even.

Was he speaking to some sort of savage?

<font color = white>&#34;G-good luck in the academy..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I mean, uh..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. saw what? I did nothing.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't like his face.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ?!?!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: I see everything, I've been practicing.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I would pass on eating contests.. They are a waste of food.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's kinda rude.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) pulled out a fish of her own as she stared towards it. She&#39;d take a few seconds of simply gazing at the fish before starting to copy the teacher as she devoured it all bar the bone which would be deposited into a nearby trashcan.

However astute eyes would notice that whilst the fish she had taken out was raw, every bite would be charred and mostly cooked as they entired her mouth. The Hyuugas would clearly notice her pumping katon attuned chakra into the fish to flashcook it.

<font color = white>&#34;Now I&#39;m a real woman, like sensei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: I heard that, y'know?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh yeah? Well--
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I was talking to my friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Loudly.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That is the true test of womanhood...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm...a waste. I guess that makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's okay, I don't like you either. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yawns while trotting down the road.
He glances over to Kamiya, standing next to his sister.

<font color = white>&#34;You.&#34;</font> He scowls ot the both of them, though mostly to Kamiya for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: You looked at her weirdly. I didn't appriecate that.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Usually people descale and debone the Sashimi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) giggled at Sakuya&#39;s words. She approached Hajime and drew her nails down her cheeks, drawing blood--

And then, Shun&#39;ichi appeared.

<font color = white>&#34;What?&#34;</font> She spat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: A true women it's it whole I've been told.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) would walk up to where a lot of people were..

<font color = white>&#34;So this is where everyone went!&#34;</font> She would say as she munched on a strawberry mochi!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...............
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I must continue my search for Kumirama.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: She went north I believe but I might be blind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) paused. 

Her limited attention span was drawn to the events taking place nearby. Aversion, repulsion, and every sickened emotion in between creased and wrinkled her face, watching someone eat a fish of all things in such a animalistic manner!

<font color = white>&#34;Gross. Fish are gross! Don&#39;t you know where that thing&#39;s been, Maya?!&#34;</font>
She waved her arms frantically in protest!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares.

His eyes widen upon seeing the illogical behavior of Kamiya, who draws blood with her own nails. 

<font color = white>&#34;Umm... Kamiya, does that not hurt...?&#34;</font> He asks, though the sheer display has him weirded out, incredibly so.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held out a single seal, disappearing.

<font color = white>&#34;I was hunt her like a hunter during mating season.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: What a interesting person.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;.....&#34;</font> Nothing was said, he simply glares, circling her aimlessly before replacing her spot at Sakuya&#39;s side.

<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you hanging around that thing, sis?&#34;</font> He initiates.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) looks to Maya as a fish was withdrawn from somewhere and stared at, <font color = white>&#34;Wait, that&#39;s not good for you--&#34;</font> The Hyuuga grimaced as the Gorumba&#39;s mouth opened to chow down - only to relax all of a sudden and exhale. All tension flows away, like that ryo bill in the river would have if not &#39;saved&#39; by Hanako.

She was puffing flames to cook it at the very last second... Scary, but... Not as poisonous as it could have been. The fish probably had scales and everything though, gross.

<font color = white>&#34;...I think fish isn&#39;t for me anymore.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) removed a napkin from her pouch as she began to delicately dab at her lips in order to clean them of any fishy debris before turning her attention towards Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;This river, I caught it myself...&#34;</font>

A simple answer to a straight forward questio as her head cocked to the side in a curious manner.

<font color = white>&#34;And it&#39;s a fresh as it comes, orphans can&#39;t be picky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: What thing are you talking about?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) swiped her eyes over at Hajime. The cuts aren&#39;t particularly deep, but she bled softly from the rake all the same. It doesn&#39;t take long for it to roll down to her jawline, and then drip to the cobblestone beneath.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course it hurts.&#34;</font> She replied, before moving to face the ugly, green-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m going to hurt you really badly.&#34;</font> She promised to Shun&#39;ichi.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Wait! I know what to do. We should check if she's choking or just poisoned.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) would not take a third insult from the boy. It's all too soon that he once again would find himself dodging, but this is less of a hateful kick than last night-- it's more of a pirouette, delivered faster, and toward his head.</font></font></font>

It was indeed a pin bone that she had swallowed, a sharp end had lodged itself within the base of her esophagus and needed to be dislodged.

However she was too weak to dislodge it herself, causing each weak dull thump to just cause her to choke loudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) held mochi to her mouth as the girl barragged her with words... She didn't exactly understand sarcasm... She just stared at her...</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I knew it!

And immediately slammed it against Maya&#39;s back to dislodge the bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Why must you fight your comrades?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh! You know acupressure! 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Yeah, hit her in the solar meridian left and to the east point!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Hinoue(The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) OOCs: (wow)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) deciding that, Maya&#39;s life was not being tended to properly, the young Hajime suddenly breaks off into a sprint. This needed to be a precise move to work, or else, it simply would not work.

He had seen it happen before..! 

<font color = white>&#34;No pain, no gain..&#34;</font>

After garnering the necessary momentum, the young orphan jumps onto Maya&#39;s stomach to deliver a drop kick with the force of gravity behind it, performing the most violent heimlich maneuver possible..!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got you..!&#34;</font>

The fact that the Hyuuga was trying to save her had ignited his competitive spirit, and he wished to do so, instead. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Hinoue(The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) OOCs: (that was my saving roll)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) idly starts picking things up.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) apparently misses and falls face first into the ground?!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) swaps to dragging Hajime to the river instead. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: New patient! 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi(The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (My fault, was setting up profile, gimme like one more min)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: W-wait! I'm fine..!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) Alas! A saviour who knew what was wrong, her attempted murder by drowning was adverted for now as the strike PERFECTLY dislodged the bone as it ejected from her mouth with speed, flying through the air in a perfect arc before landing innocently on the ground in front of them.

A gasp of air entered her lungs as she began to violently cough for a few seconds.

<font color = white>&#34;T-Thanks... damn fish bone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Are you sure? You ate pavement really hard!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Like.. your head made a 'thonk' noise.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I thought that only happened in manga! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) has a lump on his head, from it striking the pavement.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, but if you put me in the water, I&#39;ll get wet. My money will get wet. Then, I won&#39;t be able to buy you the stuff I told you I would.&#34;</font> He protests, before he raises both hands up to plead for mercy.

His eyes were spinning, though. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) released him, if only because he insisted he was fine. 

<font color = white>&#34;Untrue! Shopkeeps don&#39;t mind when the ryo&#39;s a little soggy! They just.. narrow their eyes and stare at you a lot. It&#39;s probably because the sogginess makes the numbers harder to read?&#34;</font> She shrugs! A hand came down, offering to yank him to his feet. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would watch the Senju and Kaguya both strike the bastard child of a Senju, he was doomed. Though, the one being struck was being a jerk. He honestly didn&#39;t care if it didn&#39;t escalate further than it had, and all the while another girl was saved from a fish bone.

<font color = white>&#34;And the day was saved, thanks to the Hyuuga.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) An overbearingly smug grin hooked upon the corners of the Hyuuga&#39;s lips and tugged wider as she witnessed her perfect strike dislodge the fish bone straight from the source. It surprised her a little, but she would never admit that. As far as anyone else knew, this was planned and she was the most skilled academy student.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahaha! You&#39;re welcome. Nothing comes close to my clan&#39;s techniques after all,&#34;</font> she proclaimed, side-eyeing Hajime after he had failed to compete and was now being dragged off to heal underwater. Or attempted to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) The backhand, caught him off-guard! The Senju sibling was definitely quicker than the Kedoiin, which forces him to bite on his tongue fiercely. <font color = white>&#34;Owhhhhh! Sahu--&#34;</font> Followed by Kamiya&#39;s own violent outburst, though, he wouldn&#39;t give the girl the satisfaction of hitting him.

Blocking the girl&#39;s attack, he continues to whine with a damaged tongue, <font color = white>&#34;Buh, Kahiha sarhed i&#39; &#39;he ot&#39;er deh!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) accepts the yank!

He rises to his feet with her aid, a tad wobbly. He threatens to wobble in all four cardinal directions and fall again, due to the previous impact.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow. Can you guys stop spinning, please?..&#34;</font> He requests, before side-eyeing the spinning Hanako as well, with a faint flash of spite.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Hinoue.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Could I speak with you in private?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) relentlessly attacked, delivering another kick. He seemed to think this was some sort of game--

It was not, as the blood poured from her own rakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) noticed Hajime&#39;s unsteadiness.

A swirl that carried him east, north, west, south! Hm! Clearly the remedy for such things was to spin him in the opposite direction, as to unwind the factors that made him dizzy in the first place! So! She grasped him by the shoulders and spun him clockwise, akin to a kid being prepared for their turn at a pinata. 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s okay! I&#39;ll just.. unspin you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I'm a medical professional. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) was not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) arched a brow inquisitively as the veiny protrusions spreading from those fainty lavender orbs would gradually soften and lose their prominence - no longer visible against skin. She wondered what could have prompted this request, but she doubts it was anything bad after witnessing her greatness just now.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... Alright, sure,&#34;</font> she obliged, <font color = white>&#34;Lead the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Oh no.

<font color = white>&#34;W-wait..! Unspin..? Wah..!&#34;</font>

The unspinning has the opposite effect and he finds himself teetering even more, until he threatens to collapse right onto Hanako..! A hand rises to cover his mouth, as well.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) recognized that shade of green. Why-- that&#39;s the same shade of green she took on mere moments ago, watching Maya chomp on raw fish! She frantically circled him, intent on escaping his potential spew range!

<font color = white>&#34;Ack, abort, abandon mission! It didn&#39;t work! It didn&#39;t work!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) pulled a chair out of her pocket and took a seat on the bridge to watch the commotions until something else happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Seeing that the situation has escalated beyond any hope of peaceful resolution, Sakuya joins Kamiya in taking decisive action against Shun&#39;Ichi. She launches into a coordinated assault, seamlessly blending their movements into a relentless series of kicks and stomps. What unfolds could be likened to what is widely known as <font color = white>&#34;being jumped,&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) collapses to the ground, and though he keeps his mouth covered for a few moments, he soon breathes a sigh of relief.

He had avoided death itself. Or the death of his self-image for the foreseeable future.

Only after a few moments, does he tilt his head backwards while lying on the ground to finally realize that the fight was still ongoing.

<font color = white>&#34;W-woah... They&#39;re jumping that kid... &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hm??
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Nah, they're just helping him out. Probably. He's clearly choking.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) passes off the fish.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: No, no... They're stomping him out...
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Hm? Just a normal day at the orphanage... kids have to be strong enough to protect themselves.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Like, when you talk back against the big kid in the orphanage..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: H-hey..! Cease this stompening!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) received a bunch of fish. She released them back to their natural habitat. 

They lifelessly float away on the current, dumped back into the river. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Goodbye, fish. Go back to peeing in the ocean, as Kami intended.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Ugh...
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Class time...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: In a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I wonder what will be thrown at us today..
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Not a fat kid, I hope.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would order his regular hich was just a cup of green tea for himself, <font color = white>&#34;She doesn&#39;t stay in one place long- She&#39;s off in an instant sometimes.

I&#39;m sure we should be making ourselves to class, but we have time to spare.&#34;</font> He stated mixing honey into his cup before taking a sip, turning towards Yakeru and Yuuto.

<font color = white>&#34;What do you think class will be about today?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) felt a twinge of audacious spite creep up on his shoulders. To which he&#39;s forced to answer with his own deftness.
First order of business, getting away from Kamiya--she&#39;s the stronger one of the two, if his memory serves him correctly, so getting away from her would prove advantageous, forcing him to only deal with Sakuya.

He&#39;s never won a fight against her, though today&#39;s the day he might be given the chance to try.
Kamiya is evaded this time, with Sakuya being blocked. He uses Sakuya&#39;s weight to bounce away from the dynamic duo and more toward the riverbanks. The bell sounds, however, he knows the kids won&#39;t relent; and he doesn&#39;t plan on doing so either.
<font color = white>&#34;Coh&#39; aht meh... Bich&#39;s.&#34;</font> He states, as long as Kamiya&#39;s interrupted by Sakuya, he&#39;s safe, somewhat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Hey, hey! Two on one isn't fair..!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) sighed and scratched his head. <font color = white>&#34;Considering the location of the class... they said Kumirama&#39;s gonna drown... and the fact we just started the academy and have to learn the basic jutsus... we&#39;re probably gonna have to learn how to swim or walk on water.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;By the way, now that I think about all this, I can now confidently say.&#34;</font> He spoke with a sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Kumirama is not gonna be drowning alone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) delivers the line that had gotten him stomped out at the orphanage many times.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) took the final bite of his porkbun, finishing it off before swallowing it down.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not sure, I do remember her mentioning a mental workout.&#34;</font> he mentions before taking a sip of his juice.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) was on his ass. Was she lying about him being faster? It seemed like it...

Just as a punch is about to be thrown to his cranium, though, the dancer twisted her body away and cartwheeled to a standing position.

<font color = white>&#34;I head the academy bell. You&#39;re lucky.&#34;</font> she said, to the fat-tongued boy. <font color = white>&#34;You will apologize to me after class or you&#39;re going to keep getting this.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t a very hard demand to meet, luckily for him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya stopped her assualt. It was time for class.

<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be inconviencing us like this Shun.&#34;</font> She shrugs as she readies herself to leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) will definitely be drowning.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) breathes a sigh of relief once he sees that yet another stomping had been averted..! No doubt thanks to his efforts, as he had told them that stomping was wrong, and to cease. Clearly, this was a victory for him.

He rises to his feet after a few moments, still a bit wobbly, but he smiles regardless.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;all wanna&#39; head to that lesson?&#34;</font> He asks, before his gaze focuses upon the one referred to as Shun.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, man! You alright?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, shoot. I'm gonna be late! 
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: You're gonna be early.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: It's okay to be a little early, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. wait. I still haven't turned in my application. I can't be late.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Turn it in..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm safe.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No! I like the immunity! 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: You wanna' be immune to graduation, too?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: If I turn it in, they'll start keeping my lateness on record--
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. I'll turn it in the day before I graduate.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's the perfect crime.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Huh. Smart...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll go on ahead! Uh-- where's the class at? 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: West.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) paid the bill for all the food they ate and hopped off his seat.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) blew a raspberry at Kamiya and Sakuya, moving to the snow to shove some in his mouth, hopefully it'll stop swelling soon. Though, the Kaguya's sudden advancement did muddle him slightly... Just how much quicker has she gotten in the past few days...? And how quickly could she advance?

Well, there's a limit to how much power one could produce without actively dipping their toes into the Shinobi world... Perhaps it was simply a gap in skill as opposed to some innate talent or development. Yeah... That's probably it.
He ignores Hajime, watching the duo who nearly beat his ass strut off, enviously figuring out how to get some revenge.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: This guy looks fine.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: We should all go... I'll see you there.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Which way is west--
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Guess we can head over.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll follow him! 
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Hajme!

<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Me.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Says me.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hah ha.. there's no one that large.

<br><font color=teal>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) whispers faintly.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares at Kamiya as she obnoxiously laughs, before he laughs faintly himself. He only now notices her presence, and shudders.

Why did he have to stand next to her?

He shuffles in his spot. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: What's wrong with getting some rest?
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) whispers faintly.
