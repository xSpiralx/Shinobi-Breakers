<font color = white>&#34;Hey hey, chop chop wife, you want that allowance, you&#39;re going to have to work for it, wife. Get to making them sandwiches.&#34;</font>

He gives her a playful touch on the arm as if he thought he was being loving and romantic..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Ill take my buns toasted, extra mayo with bacon and chopped chicken.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Tomatos, and add a little pepper.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) yells: Toasted Buns!!!!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Buns...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Beef Bacon in between...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) looked towards the red eyed girl and scratched his cheek.
<font color = white>&#34;Er.. I&#39;m just makin&#39; sure he ain&#39;t sleepin&#39; on the job, that&#39;s all lady.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) salivates</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: What job, is that?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Mn...&#34;</font> The boy grunts in discomfort, someone is holding back. Or, worse yet: <i>somebody knows he&#39;s searching for them.</i>

Shuye&#39;s words pierce through his concentration just before he attempted to trudge deeper.
<font color = white>&#34;Mnh? O-Oh!.&#34;</font> He acknowledges Kunigami with a bow, clasping his hands together in the process. His eyes burn into the two-tone head&#39;s face for a second, just for a second though--a rare occasion on his part.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: OOOH  IDea...  What if we do like CHEECE TOASTED STUFFED TOASTED BUNS?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave them a nod and left it at that.
Now then...

...what's going on over there? He's finally free to focus on the chatter. People-watching and such. He took a seat on the arena's edge, listening in on this talk of sandwiches and holy matrimony(?). </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Eh. cheese, sorry I blanked out.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: All this food talk, someone's about to owe me a meal after this if it keeps going...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) drools a litte bit at Tsuneko's ideal.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) waved her hand in front of the dark skinned not-quite-teen.

<font color = white>&#34;What job?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) closed her eyes, a vein buldged across her forehead -- though hidden by her bangs. Her irritation had reached its limit and although this boy didn&#39;t mean any harm she found his words to be truly demeaning. How dare he try bossing her around? That was her job.

<font color = white>&#34;You idiot!&#34;</font> she barked. With a clenched fist she sought to bonk the boy on the head. While she didn&#39;t really have any strength behind the punch, if it hit it&#39;d probably leave a lump on his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll never marry ya&#39;! Tha&#39; person I marry would know that -I&#39;m- tha&#39; prize damnit!&#34;</font> Reilin exclaimed. 
(D- Agi. Not actually trying to deal any damage so I guess E Str)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) placed a hand on his hip and tilts his head to the side.
<font color = white>&#34;The job ta be ready whenever an enemy invades the village, woman.&#34;</font> he told her plainly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept up her scowl, unamused.

<font color = white>&#34;He doesn&#39;t even have a headband. He has no job.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She's got a point! Sh- Er, both of the girls talking right now I guess.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) pondered if she should kick him into the moat, just to get revenge from earlier, but figured it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea.

Well, it was, because she&#39;d come up with it, but it would come with a degree of future revenge, probably.

<font color = white>&#34;Have fun with that. M&#39;gonna go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: NO for real......Whos making those sandwhiches.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No one is big guy. No one is...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was completely off guard as he was continuing to take orders and was decked with a &#39;powerful punch&#39; that sent him flying.

<font color = white>&#34;--Gaaaaaaahhh!&#34;</font>

He slams on the floor while skidding slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hrngh..Ouch..Y-you&#39;re the prize??&#34;</font>

He grunts as he raises up to his feet, rubbing the afflicted area.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay okay..I think I get it..Ill buy you an apron before you get to making the sandwhiches...And a hair net!&#34;</font>

(Damage taken!)</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Don't worry..she's making the sandwhiches!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..Ouch..what a punch..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) moves over and stares the Uchihue into the eyes!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a great prize, mhm mhm.&#34;</font>

Hmmm, sammiches sound good though.

The spider girl would side step away again as she stares up at the sky.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: The wonders of youth...but arent you a bit to young to be asking girls to become housewives.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) had a strong suspicion they would try to push him into the moat too. Weird that they didn't.
<b>The Fūma would remember this.</b> Perhaps he would go easy on her the next time the opportunity to throw blunt objects at faces arose. 

Either way, he continued to sit there, with a water bottle in hand. Idly taking sips. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Too young? My paw said to find a beautiful girl and to marry her!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I don't know, Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: So I'm doing just that!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Eh hmm..That reminds me, I wonder if she has any pepper corn ranch...
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: Hey wife! You got any pepper corn ranch for my sandwich??
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) suddenly begins to sweat a little bit. It's a very delayed response, but he can feel Shuye's looking in his general direction. His eyes wander in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Mmmmm peppercorn.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) points, this time more softly.

<font color = white>&#34;Mn... Ho...u as.....des...ions....th.....tong....in?&#34;</font> He murmurs for only her to translate.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) is looking past Venturo, to the tall man with the staff-- which makes his subtle sweat and anxiety even more funny.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) smirked to herself as she watched the children bicker. The mood was certainly boiling up to something edging on exciting.

<font color = white>&#34;Do not let that slight go unansweared young lady! I will owe you ten ryo should you make him eat such words.&#34;</font> She would march closer, a fire burning in her eyes to see more vicious bonks be delivered</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) yells: Yer' paw should have relayed it a bit better. Now all the girls are just going to think you are a creep. But uh..Good luck!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) glanced over.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey. The One who fell just before the Finish Line, considered quitting, but powered through with his pride intact. What&#39;s your name?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Six Arms, what's yer' name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her head toward Meixun then, giving Venturo a moment&#39;s repireve. She spoke, but the words didn&#39;t make any sense to anyone else at first, then.

<font color = white>&#34;You introduce yourself deferentially. Then you ask what his &#39;rank&#39; is-- He&#39;s old, so he&#39;s probably a chuunin. Unless he&#39;s talented, then he&#39;s probably a jounin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I am Tsuneko of the Tsuchigumo clan!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) felt satisfied after lashing out. Through she still held her fist up before lowering it just as Tsuneko made a remark. <font color = white>&#34;See? She gets it.&#34;</font> finally she slipped her hands into her pockets and looked toward the Troublemaker. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not makin&#39; any sandwiches! An&#39; I ain&#39;t marryin&#39; you!&#34;</font> she shook her head.

<font color = white>&#34;I might have&#39;ta knock more sense into ya&#39; if ya&#39; keep this up!&#34;</font> she stated. Though at the mention of peppercorn ranch she narrowed her gaze. Almost dumbfounded at this character. She could hardly believe it. But she did have an idea.

<font color = white>&#34;Listen.. If I&#39;m even gonna consider marryin&#39; you.. Ya&#39; gotta show me yer worth it.&#34;</font> she pinched her thumb and fingertips before rubbing them together, a universal signal for &#39;money&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (somber looking girl that profile ass
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) slowly steps side-ways along the edge of the arena. Moving closer to the masked rock-thrower while keeping his eyes on whatever thing is happening in across the moat. 

Leaning his head to the side, he says <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s Utsuwa Hideo. You&#39;re... something Katora, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) 's hands clasp together, his thumbs beginning to fidget. He's confident that he's the one being stared at...
... Then he feels her direction change. Something grabbed her attention, and thus was his time to make his great escape.. but he'd have to do it in a way that was subtle. One that wouldn't draw much attention. He could start running, he could leap across to the platform in the middle...

... Then it hit him.

He'd just... start walking away.
Very slowly.

Bit by bit...
Not once does he turn his head, to avoid making eye contact.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) continues to rub his cheek and listens to the girl and notices that sign.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh..I think I get it..So to marry you I must get money! Do not worry, I will buy your love someday. Remember the name, Kaido! Iwagakure&#39;s most crafty ninja.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. Katora. Fūma Clan. 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Reilin do you like Kimono?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Nice to meet you
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Hey guys, we're going to have to put a hold on those sandwhiches for a while!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Nooooooooooo my sammich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a light laugh at the happenings across the moat. 
<font color = white>&#34;Ha... Kunoichi are scary.&#34;</font> A statement made with slow shakes of head. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Kinda cool. In a cute way.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: The Utsuwa family, huh? Can't say I've heard of them. What do they do?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched Venturo slowly depart, then snapped her eyes back to her brother, wondering which to answer first. Finally, she decided.

<font color = white>&#34;No, they don&#39;t. I&#39;d need to look in the textbook to get the exact definition. Just ask his name.&#34;</font> She said, before calling after Venturo.

<font color = white>&#34;Goodbye to you too then.&#34;</font> She sounded annoyed-- insulted, even.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Right, Kaido.. I'll make sure not ta' forget. I'm Uchiha, Reilin. Wish I could say it was nice ta' meet ya', Kaido but it ain't.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ehh, Kimono are nice.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh I don't know if my dad wants us to talk about that sort of thing or not.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why do ya' ask?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was merely gazing over the boys head, she did give a curious glance down at the fidgiting but alas....she was set to see the brewing lovers spat.

<font color = white>&#34;How calm it has become....I was hoping for something more entertaining to pass the time with.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: That's fair. Every family has their secrets.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I mostly meant the job-related stuff. Like, say, shopkeeping, blacksmithing, construction.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) grins at Rellin.

<font color = white>&#34;You won&#39;t be saying that when I become the richest in the village and a really successful shinobi..You&#39;ll be dying to marry me some day, Rellin Uchiha..So much, youll take my last name and drop the Uchiha from yours!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Hm? I dont care spread our name far and wide boyo! I do find it strange they havent heard of my last name. Moniker might be overshadowing it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) put a hand over her mouth at the mention of dropping her name. To onlookers she may have appeared shocked, but in reality she was stiffling her laughter.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh- We're all shinobi, I think. I 'unno what mom did before she passed. Or what our grandparents do, if anything. But dad's super cool and strong. And I wanna be too.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Right, I can't wait
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) has a pang hit him in the chest. Wait. Was he misreading the situation? He thought he was due for some sort of pummeling...but those words.. they couldn&#39;t have been for anyone else.

His contemplation is evident in the way he stops in his slow trek away. Not only did he fail in his mission, but he failed as a friend. As a teammate. As a lover of all things Earth.
To the child, these feelings all amalgamated into something he couldn&#39;t properly understand, but one thing he &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; know for certain was that it didn&#39;t feel good.

He turns back around, non-chalantly as if he wasn&#39;t in the middle of sneaking just now.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh? What&#39;s up?&#34;</font> he says, putting on an act. <font color = white>&#34;I thought I saw another neat pebble, but no.. not this time. I wasn&#39;t going anywhere! We&#39;re hanging out, after all! ... Right?&#34;</font> 

Accompanied with his act was probably one of the largest, most genuine smiles.</font></font></font>

But. Each step he takes he gets slower... And... Slower. Something&#39;s off, the feeling&#39;s familiar--he&#39;s felt it infinitely back when he was younger, though as of right now? The feeling is... Jarring: it&#39;s warning him not to move forward, but that warning clashes with the nostalgia.
He bites his upper lip, steeling his resolve--whatever this unbecoming feeling was, it wouldn&#39;t dissuade him from getting used to the people here; and what better way to start than with someone of high statue?

<font color = white>&#34;....&#34;</font> He glares at the Vassal, eyes melding as per usual, attempting to dig something out of the man uncomfortably. Uncontrollably even, it&#39;ll most likely be something he&#39;ll never get over.

He speaks with the same, odious vile tone he&#39;s always spoken with.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was not the type to so easily forgive. Her arms crossed across her chest as they had time and time again, and would time and time again in the future. But the tuck&#39;s a little tighter, a little more standoffish. There&#39;s a shift in her weight onto the back foot, and a fierceness to her furrowed brow. Maybe it was the red eyes making it seem even more intense. He had been caught. He had been seen.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not sure I want to after that. Maybe I should give you back your pebble?&#34;</font>

Anything but the returning of a gift.
<font color = white>&#34;W-Wait!&#34;</font> he stammers, <font color = white>&#34;Didn&#39;t anybody ever teach you that returning a gift is insulting?!&#34;</font> he asks, beginning to flail his arms about in the air, even doing a little hover dance in place. Oh yeah, he&#39;s shaken. Defeated, even.

<font color = white>&#34;Lemme make it up to you! I&#39;ll help you on your next homework assignment, buy you lunch one day, get you another rock! Anything but that!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Strong team mates are hard to find.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: We need teammates...?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Eventually. You will.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: W-Why though?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I plan and prepare for the future.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Past Graduation... once you're working beyond the village walls. 
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: You'd want to figure out who you work best with now. Right?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Indeed!  It's best to start getting to know people first and getting togehter to make teams, perhaps!  Uchiha's are VERY strong.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) received the kimono and was impressed by how nice the fabric was. Surely it was not your average piece of clothing, quite a luxurious. . . custom. . . piece.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll have to try it on. It&#39;s quite now.&#34;</font> by now her delinquent side had vanished and her more polite and proper side returned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) was a Tsuchigumo and thus accustomed to gathering silks and the like from spiders or even silk worms.  SILK IS LIFE!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Hrm... Seems kinda lame to swarm her just cause of her family name though. Right?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A name's just a name. You're right.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) would not mention how many silk worms were boiled to death in the process of silk gathering...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: No one cares about her family name.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: But I'm going to have to ask you guys to give my wife some space.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I mean, people from clans care about their family name.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) held her ground while he made his energetic display in front of her. The silence radiating from her was menacing, until she finally spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need help on homework. You&#39;re probably a slacker. I don&#39;t need lunch bought, I make my own.&#34;</font> Her eyes narrowed, just a fraction. <font color = white>&#34;And if I was going to return your rock... why would another rock persuade me not to...?&#34;</font>

Oh, she was cruel.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Best to focus on personal skill, but to their credit, the Uchiha are known to produce quality shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Means people are gonna target them though, right? That's rough buddy...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You're not wrong. Sounds hard, with everyone expecting so much.
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: What an ulucky child....
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (these clothes don't come off v.v)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fuma, Katora(The blond lad-Iodized Salt) OOCs: [wait, you can't take off custom clothes?]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) gasps!
He could understand the homework part. Shuye definitely seemed smart, and on top of that, she&#39;d have him sussed pretty correctly as a slacker. He often used &#39;charm&#39; to get his expectations lowered. It figures as well that she&#39;d be able to make her own lunch as well...

But what got him this time, was the logic behind the rock. She nailed him.
... Until...
<font color = white>&#34;To help kickstart your new collection of Venturo-branded rocks, of course!&#34;</font>

The shock seemed to be completely gone. He was smiling at her again, unphased. Seemed all you had to do was keep to the topic of these different &#39;collectibles&#39; to keep him engaged and excited.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mooonn, Shuye! You can&#39;t stay mad at me, pretty please? Extra please with your favorite topping on top? Do you even like toppings? Ice cream?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) shifted his eyes towards the youth, who slowly moved closer to him. His staggered steps causing the jounin to be a bit cautious.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm..&#34;</font>?,he looked puzzled at the question.

<font color = white>&#34;I am not..even sure who you are talking about..&#34;</font>,he patted the boy on the head.
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) she frowned now at the display of....begging was it? <font color = white>&#34;He has now shifted into being sad. I cant stand to see such a day be wasted on groveling.&#34;</font> She spun on her heel and leaped. 

Landing on a tree limp before bouncing further away to explore the village a tad.  <font color = white>&#34;I will be back when events of note have reared!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (I def need help learning to be a Tsuchi.)
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: So.. speaking of the future. What do you plan on studying, Hideo?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Oh- All sorts of stuff! Whatever makes me stronger and more like my old man!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was unamused by his burst of energy. She really was a bundle of joy and fun, huh? They say act your age usually to disparage immature individuals, but what about those that were TOO mature, too jaded for their age? Still, the ice finally began to thaw when he mentioned those last two words.

<font color = white>&#34;Ice cream. Yes, good idea. No rocks, Venturo.&#34;</font> She slowly dropped her arms, gently relaxing her shoulders into their more natural, sloping state instead of tight, raised, almost square. <font color = white>&#34;You were obviously going to try to sneak off and surpirse me with ice cream.&#34;</font> She lied, offering him an out after making him sweat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair. I know it must be incredibly difficult to tell, but my focus happens to be throwing weapons. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah I figured with those pebbles you threw... Pretty good shot, man.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) is now wearing the kimono and no she did not get naked in front of everything she totally just went home and came back.

Anyhow, she&#39;d twirl in place. <font color = white>&#34;How do I look?&#34;</font> she asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ha. I can't call myself good until I can hit a moving target from fifteen meters away, with a forest's worth of trees in the way.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'm a novice at best. For now.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Nice kimono but you shouldn't take things from strangers.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Brother
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) seems to have found some sort of gateway.. one that could only work a limited amount of times. He shoots an index finger into the air, almost a &#39;eureka&#39; moment coming up as she provides him the out, as if he had thought of it himself.
Foolish, truly.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes! And theeennn I was wondering what kind of ice cream you even like!&#34;</font>

He&#39;ll definitely still be getting her another rock.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I'm not a stranger.  I'm Tsuneko!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hmmm?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Play two hundred with me
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: That's Tsuneko, we've met before.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Nii-san
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Eh? Sure, come over here.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: That's why you turned back, because you forgot that it's Matcha.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Oh? Playing the timeless game passed down for generations worldwide?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I might join you.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Right! 
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: It's scary how well you know me, Shuye.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm I have a one win so far
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Do we have anything to bet with though? I'm tired of playing for sticks and cool rocks..
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A local champion at that. Scary.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Wait. You didn't get any ryo from that course?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Ooo big number
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I did but I don't have enough for my family's clothes
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) finally relaxed her expression, her features softening and eyes widening.

<font color = white>&#34;What are you waiting for?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Oh...&#34;</font> An uneven mixture of fear and comfort condensed itself into the boy&#39;s core. The man&#39;s pat gave Meixun confirmation that he has never met this man before, not that it would produce any anxiety. So where did the familiar feeling come from? The razors that hover above his eyes shut tightly and he once again... Focuses.

To prevent from being rude, he answers the mystery of who exactly this &#39;&#39;Iroha&#39;&#39; character is. Eyes closed and body completely bent on analyzing the Vassal&#39;s signature..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Oh, right! Okay! I'll be back!
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Thank dad!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: I'll wager ten on this game. Fair?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) suddenly takes off. He really was going to have to go find an ice cream stand.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Fair
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Ten's fine, sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Damn I'm so good at game's of random chance...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Now let's see...
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Pride comes before the fall. It's best to play humble.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: The local Champion lives up to the name.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: We had a good run, Hideo.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Himeki is simply too strong...
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A worthy opponent to meet our end by.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ugh.. this is the end for me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) nods to the strange boy.

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Ha... a rematch would leave me with cobwebs in my wallet, so I'll surrender. For now.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed confused for a moment. Clearly, the language processor in her brain was working overtime.

<font color = white>&#34;--kind of. Wonderful means... nice, but that word doesn&#39;t necessarily mean nice. It&#39;s... more... wonder, awe inspiring. It doesn&#39;t have to be positive.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: You have a visitor.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yo.

Two ice cream cones in hand. One arm more outstretched than the other.
One, evidently matcha flavored, somehow pristine with a waffle cone and all.
The other? A simple, definitely melting rocky road cone. Why was one perfectly fine?

<font color = white>&#34;I have the goods, Shuye!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) cocked his head to the side, beady-eyed.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (Anyone who is new. Come outside for a repost)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) witnessed a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.

(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)

He slung his own across his right shoulder, and eyed the exit once more. Well, as long as nobody else enters anytime soon, he'll be.... More than poinent.

<font color = white>&#34;Name&#39;s Fubuki, I will be the one who takes you down.&#34;</font>

She couldn&#39;t care less about anyone who entered, all that mattered was that she got her fight properly. Once the boy took a step forward Fubuki started running really fast for an academy student, closing the gap between the two albeit just barely and also extending her arm behind her, releasing it forward and aiming at the boy&#39;s streamer - but obviously using no strength, as if she had any.</font></font></font>

She was fast, to say the least. Meaning that he&#39;d have no option other than to combat her.
Instead of countering her attempt, Meixun took to making a swift dodge motion, pushing himself off the trash bin to settle behind the girl.

In the process, his hand darted to grab her unoccupied wrist, an attempt to spin her about in order to find whatever the both of them were searching for: in layman&#39;s terms, Fubuki&#39;s streamer.

His ears twitched slightly, there were more and more entering the bathroom, watching the display...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) wasn't expecting him to dodge her attack just like that - not only did he know combat stances but he was agile enough to fight in close quarter combat. It was the fight of her life!

Her wrist got grabbed and she was span around before she could do anything, but just as one of the streamers on her belt got revealed she'd lift her leg to block him from touching anything. She kept spinning and used that chance to try and kick his waist, maybe she'd land on his streamer by pure chance.

She paid no attention to the people entering the room, she was fully focused in the fight right now.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a familiar presence enter finally, it was Shuye!
Wait, if this is a ''free-for-all'' battle, doesn't that mean that everyone, including his elder sister, is an oppone--

The boy's thought process was halted by a brush-off, they're equals in technique and striking--but she could maneuver quicker than him... A taxing performance indeed, though the appearance of two potential adversaries opened up more offerings of distraction; either ot himself or to Fubuki.
Her kick seemingly connected with the boy's abdomen, before it quickly revealed to be a ruse to pull Fubuki closer, Meixun's face collapsed voluntarily toward the girl's midsection, aiming to gnash at the belt with his own teeth,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) Both of them seemed to be completely equal in regards to their Taijutsu ability, speed and flexibility. And though this was essentially the hardest set up she could've chosen, Fubuki couldn't be any happier - she couldn't stop smirking.

The moment her kick 'connected' she thought she had won one of the streamers, but of course it couldn't be that easy. She just nearly kicked his abdomen. Thankfully Fubuki wasn't using any strength and even if she was, she was very weak so she didn't have to worry about hurting him.

Meixun's strategy was surprising but not completely unexpected, for she played dirty too. She grabbed the boy by the hair and pulled his head up before letting it go, using her other hand to try and snatch one of his streamers from his belt if he had it there.

Hug Fubuki. No, really--an embrace... In the middle of their fight. 
Both of Meixun's hands were locking fingers while behind Fubuki's back tightly, his legs followed suit and before long, he was being backpacked--or frontpacked--by the elder teen. The child's facade of a simple hug dissolved by the time his legs wapped around hers--it's archaic, juvenile more accurately, but it was a grapple nonetheless. The best way to circumvent a stalemate? Make it stale.

In reality he was pitting strength against strength, seeing how much time it took before he was snatched off of her and back into the fray of battle. Also, it'd give him time to recognize any... 
Final stands should things get iffy in the process..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s hand reached out towards his belt until her arm couldn&#39;t extend anymore. She couldn&#39;t move her arm - most of her body in fact couldn&#39;t be moved. Fubuki needed a moment to realize she was getting hugged by the kid - thankfully it was a grapple technically so she didn&#39;t even need to be embarrassed about it. It was basically impossible to break out of so yet neither of them could reach for the other&#39;s streamer, so it was some sort of stalemate. She sighed, and spoke as he latched on to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;As much as I like fighting you, there&#39;s no way we&#39;ll ever end our fight properly. Especially with how many people surround us. You wanna go after anyone else, together?&#34;</font>

A moment of time passes before he finally discovers who the new arrival turns out to be:

It&#39;s Yurei, the other Mugen sibling; from what he could gather from sensing the slit eye&#39;d boy&#39;s battle with the rogue bull--he also works with Taijutsu, unknown to what degree however.
An Akimichi and a Taijutsu specialist, however this event will unfurl, it&#39;s best to assume nothing will come swimmingly.
He steels himself, taking action to dash first at Chonamu, regardless of how Yurei acts: he sticks to the plan.
