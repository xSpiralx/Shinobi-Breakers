<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) smiled at the boy before they looked at the one who arrived and also their current oponent - the plan seemed clear enough. She ran next to Meixun, being by his side step by step. Just as she did however, the girl got a very nice idea.

<font color = white>&#34;Meixun, keep him busy for just one moment - then I&#39;ll give you a chance!&#34;</font>

Fubuki had no time to think of how Yurei could act when he wandered into the fight, but it was best they focus on one enemy at a time regardless.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (actually, meixun next turn can i go first?)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) watched them both basically jump the poor heavy sod.
  <font color = white>&#34;And it goes like this again. . .&#34;</font> He sighed to himself, not too keen on allowing the chubby one to be jumped.

  Yurei had already been teamed up on once and grew a distaste for it in this circumstance. Besides, he was their next target.

   <font color = white>&#34;Hey big guy, when the opening is clear snatch the banner.&#34;</font>

The Mugen pivots into the air, bounces off the wall and then primes himself for to snatch the first streamer on her hip.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) or a snatch on the first streamer on her hip<i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) his opponets were rushing towards him. This made things so much easier.
The Akimichi would lash out with  his left hand in attempt to grab a hold of Meixun. If he was sucesss ful he'd aim to lift them by the front of their shirt and slam them into the ground.

He would then hear Yurei's words and nod his head.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) glanced at her side only to see someone incredibly fast reaching out for her streamer - she just barely managed to avoid it being snatched. It got the better of her however, she knew she wouldn&#39;t last long and instead of trying to defeat her opponent in a futile attempt she opted to go for her original idea.

After the Akimichi&#39;s attack she&#39;d open her arms wide and hug him much like the Meixun did with her earlier. She used everything she had to hopefully keep the Akimichi in place while her teammate attacked.

<font color = white>&#34;Take his streamer before I lose mine! If I go down it&#39;ll be in a blaze of glory!!&#34;</font> she said a bit too dramatically for the current moment.

  The Mugen boy is all smiles, the game had not ended as soon as he anticipated yet.

  <font color = white>&#34;Lemme see that.&#34;</font> He follows after being evaded.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Yurei(The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) OOCs: (its just my strain then)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) took the opportunity of distraction to switch targets. As long as Fubuki has a hold of Chonamu, the Akimichi shouldn't be too grand of an issue... right?
Fubuki's words reached him naturally, though the highest option available was to interrupt Yurei's swiping, because... Well overcoming greater opponents was the name of the game. 

He slipped out of his overcoat the moment Chonamu took ahold of it Meixun's right foot dug into the tiled floor below, allowing him to pivot solidly and make a straight dash for Yurei's person. In a span of a few seconds, the younger Zhu solidly dispels Yurei's hand with his shoulder, stopping the attempt and attempting to vye the youth's attention.

Change of plans, it begins here.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (so if he alrdy blocked tthen its fine)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (that being said turn order got messy so i also kinda lost track of things)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Yurei(The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) OOCs: (oh ok. the turn of the bodyblock movement is forfeited. just reread)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) thoughtt her plan worked when she surrounded her arms against the Akimichi - but what she wasn&#39;t expecting was how strong her opponent. In a horrible turn of events now she was the one getting hugged. Fubuki chuckled nervously.

<font color = white>&#34;So uh, how about we team u--&#34;</font>

Her eyes widened in terror as he was threatening to fall on top of her. This wasn&#39;t even about the fight anymore, he was threatening to put her in the hospital.

<font color = white>&#34;YOU KNOW YOU CAN&#39;T HURT EACH OTHER RIGHT?!&#34;</font>

It was a miracle as she slipped past him, her body crouched and then turned to the side before being turned into mashed potatoes. Even if the Akimichi was holding back his strength Fubuki was terrified nonetheless.

Then she glanced at what was happening next to her - her teammate got one of his streamers popped. Knowing there was no way to defeat the Akimichi she turned around and also lunged towards Yurei, trying to quickly grab one of his streamers in a most likely futile attempt.

Kicking into a more aggresive gear, the boy fiends for an opening, unrelenting with his strikes despite being on the backfoot of their situation.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) had no idea of what to do since her teammate was getting attacked by someone far better than him, and she was getting attacked by someone far better than her. It was pretty desperate but she ran a bit forward to avoid the lunge and being grabbed, at that moment she realized her opponent might as well be trying to put her in the hospital for real.

<font color = white>&#34;The belt! Go after THE BELT.&#34;</font> she yelled out to her opponent while once more moving her arm towards Yurei&#39;s waist and snatch his banner , perhaps if she got lucky enough she could take one of his banners though she doubted it.
[1/3 DT against Chonamu]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) legitimately dropped to the ground and spun on his shoulder with great momentum, kicking up a small debri storm of germs, fecal matter, undried urine, and dirt from shoe rubbers - dodging both their attempts at getting his banner.

   <font color = white>&#34;Ghg, ghg, ghg.&#34;</font> He tensed before trying to kick off the remaining streamer by Meixun&#39;s beltside.
[2/4]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) wasn't focused at all on his remaining streamer before feeling a wiff of air dart into swiping at Yurei. It was Fubuki! She escaped? Wait--who was Yurei targetting in the first place?!

Questions for after the fact, he supposed for now, it's time to swap targets once again. Meixun relents, exiting the conversation of battle for that short moment to designate what exactly Chonamu's next plan would result in. If things came to another rotation--perhaps everyone can get out of this with... One less streamer, if that's still the overarching goal.
His legs push him away just enough for Yurei's attempt to fall short, he huffs slightly. The dilemma was, pretty obvious by now: Fubuki's going to have to lose a streamer for this to work, all he needs to do is hope she can handle what brunt is guaranteed.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (also just to clarify, for dt im counting down not up so i have only 1 turn left, figured i miight say it since i just realized im doing itt differently)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Yurei(The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) OOCs: (i knew. only thing i don't know is who meixun disengaged from. we all still have some defensive turns left.)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (gotcha gotcha)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) it appeared that his method of imboilizing his targets and just taking both streamers was a bit ineffectivine. He&#39;d notice that Yurei was hell bent on getting his partners streamers. with her preoccupied he&#39;d lash out and aim to snatch her streamer away.

He not that Mexiuan was runining around but there was only one exit.. And he was closest to it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was unsuccesful on her attempt of getting Yurei&#39;s banner once more, and yet she just barely managed to step away from the Akimichi and avoid getting her banner caught once more. She was panting, clearly tired from all the effort - then suddenly an announcement rang through the whole village, though they were in the girl&#39;s toilet they could still hear it.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay, unless we all agree to call it quits I ain&#39;t stopping yet! FOR VICTORY, OR A DRAW AT LEAST!&#34;</font>

Once more she reached out her arm for Yurei&#39;s banner...she was really tired though.

Kaji does not mimic her pose, instead shoving a finger just under her chin. <font color = white>&#34;Well then behold,&#34;</font> His fingers press together and he snaps as if to get their attention. <font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s no beauty to be found here at all.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) furrowed her brows, her expression unable to mask her bottled fury. She was now facing him, fingers clutching his shirt tightly, as she shouts, <font color = white>&#34;Huh?! I&#39;m way more beautiful than you could ever be, you idiot!&#34;</font> Although she was taught to avoid physical contact in altercations, she couldn&#39;t prevent herself from lashing out. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) wraps his fingers around the wrist of her hand that held him.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) tilts his head to the side. His opponets had outsmarted him in the midst of combat by teling him a bell rung and it seemd as though no such thing happend..

He looks the girl over.... He remembers what she said.. <font color = white>&#34;Uhhhhhh  Jalapeno Pepper.&#34;</font>

He then gives the  beige haird youth a head nod.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) whipped her head back, her sharp, cold gaze bearing down on the heavy-breathing kid. “Well?! I'm pretty, am I not?! You wouldn't let this hooligan harm such a cute, defenseless girl with their insults, would you?!”

During her outburst, she felt her grip loosen. The beige-haired youth's strength was naturally greater than her own, given their gender, and she was left wincing as the pain from her strained effort set in.</font></font></font>

My &#39;sorry for grabbing you&#39;, huh?&#34;</font> The scowl spreads out into a thin smirk. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) blinks a few times.. <font color = white>&#34;My sister says Girls never need a boy to save them....

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) &#39;s cheeks puffed as she found herself overwhelmed by the boy&#39;s superior might, beginning to regret ever starting the altercation to begin with. And now, with nowhere to flee, and no one to call upon, she saw herself in a big dilemma. Her eyes shut tightly, praying for assistance, but alas, none would come. She could only rely on herself and her own ability.
 <font color = white>&#34;I said... Get off me!&#34;</font> she screamed.

In a fury of emotions, she aimed to wrench her arms away from his hold, using every ounce of strength within her. As desperation fueled her actions, she swung her head forward, intending to collide their foreheads. The impact, though painful, created just enough distance between them. She staggered back, her breath ragged, eyes burning with defiance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) would hear a loud bang.. Chonamu&#39;s heavy breathing would stop <font color = white>&#34;Hey ..You two stop goofing off something is happening.&#34;</font>

     A palm became a stone splitting the rushing river that was the kid&#39;s Brutish Hand. Harmlessly smacking them in the wrist to divert the trajectory of their grab. Those fingers of theirs merely close around empty air. 

In turn? He drives a speedy jab directly for the kid&#39;s sternum.
<font color = white>&#34;Not bad. I can tell you hit decent hard.&#34;</font>

Hawkish eyes took notice of every last detail, down to the way the enemy braced one palm on the stone pavement for support while they snatched for his ankle. 

A simple skip backwards was all it took to clear the grab. Only to stomp right back into reach, aiming to tear the guy&#39;s Ribbon under his sandal&#39;s tread. Again!

But. Haste makes waste. He&#39;s not liking the sound of the Akimichi&#39;s latest utterance. It almost sounds as if they have a plan. And, well, he&#39;s already scored one hit upon them, even if it was by accident...

Hm.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) snickered softly. <font color = white>&#34;Well I did think you could hold out for a little while longer, but I suppose I couldn&#39;t beat him on my own.&#34;</font> with this, the Uchiha took a breath before rushing forward to finally join the fray. Admittedly with her impressively slow speed it&#39;d take her a moment still before she would be able to get into the mix.

But given just how nimble Katora was, winning wasn&#39;t likely an option. She&#39;d take a moment to survey just how many ribbons Chonamu had. She&#39;d now be standing firmly face to face with each of them. But who would she target first?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (Totally forgot to keep round counter going on my markers lol)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) never underestimated an enemy. 
      Overestimation was key. Despite not showcasing such thus far, he suspected the Uchiha might be capable of clearing the distance to him in one stride, which would spell trouble if they saved such like a Trump Card. 

Therefore...
     As the latest heavy-weight hammer of a punch came for him? The Fuma Student dared to dash CLOSER! Yes, he darts into their guard, slanting out the way of that devastating STRAIGHT! It doesn&#39;t even clip him as he, quite literally, ran two steps up their torso. 

Chakra Adhesion of the Wall Walking technique made such tactics possible. He used them as a human springboard, pushing off his second step into a full moonsault, gone flying backwards. He landed on his feet and used the momentum to skip himself even farther. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve spent a good amount of time observing while we&#39;ve tired each other out... so I think I&#39;ve earned a breather.&#34;</font>

You&#39;re a cautious individual. After seeing that, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much of a way for us to win, admittedly. You&#39;d be able to strike either of us at least once and before we can manage to hit you, I think you&#39;d pull that maneuver again, no?&#34;</font> she inquired. Still she&#39;d pursue him all the same alongside the Akimichi.

Honestly. That no-throwing weapon rule crippled him the most! But, he would not complain.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not wrong, Reilin. Unless... you&#39;re hiding some serious talent at Taijutsu? I&#39;ve yet to see you throw a punch. That&#39;s dangerous.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;d be bad if classmates I&#39;ll have to rely on in the future start falling behind. Right? I was considering offering basic-strategy lessons. For say, close quarters. All the avenues and options beyond simply throwing punches like it&#39;s a boxing match. Escaping it, for example.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, I know what&#39;cha mean. Actually I learned a bunch from the free-for-all. I feel like I could&#39;ve taken someone down before inevitably losing. I won&#39;t complain about any lesson though, when I get good enough I could help you train against close quarter combat.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) let out an exascerbated sigh, looking at his clothing for a few moments. He still wasn't well versed enough to trot upon water just yet, so he'll need to settle with more.... Improvisational practices.

He formulates a few seals he remembered from a scroll read, then he lifted his undershirt, folding the linen neatly into a triangular plate before creasing each edge with both hands. Undoing the metallic string that held his tailed hair in the back--his hair's apparently getting longer--he wraps it around the congruent angle's point, folding that down to support the shape.

All of this was to make some sort of makeshift throwing item, to which the boy flexes his quads to toss off to the other side! Unfortunately for his aim, he ends up hitting Kitusmi, having said item dangle to the ground unceremoniously. Though there wasn't much of any time to react to that, he mosies over toward Fubuki, poking her before hissing a whisper.</font></font></font>

As Meixun got closer he'd hear a very small snore coming from Fubuki, she was standing still and not moving except for her breathing. The boy's poke however woke her up and immediately she looked kinda around, confused and unaware of what was going on. It took her a moment to realize Meixun wanted to talk to her, so she lowered herself to hear him better.

He moved over to get into a proper position. Hopefully, atleast according to the visualization of the scroll--he couldn't really read it--the technique would succeed since he's placed some chakra within his discarded undershirt.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) honestly had no idea what the boy said earlier but it seemed like she kinda understood it by the end. Regardless the sleepy girl also followed the boy, right behind him.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Kay, ready?&#34;</font>

And right after, without waiting for his approval, she&#39;d karate chop his head - it was just lightly hitting his head, not causing any actual damage.

<font color = white>&#34;Bonk.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Doubly so when it ends in a chop to that kid&#39;s forehead. Huh?

<font color = white>&#34;I believe.. he wanted you to give him a boost across the water,&#34;</font> he adds, without confidence in his speculation. </font></font></font>

He repeated his little noise dramatically as if the strike did any true damage, dissolving his will to stand.

The razors on his eyelids dig into his browline as he patters down with a divalike splash, seemingly unmoving for a while.
And... A little while more.... And more, and a bit more.... Enough mores that abit of concern should be called for...The water wasn&#39;t deep enough for him to drown, but any thalassaphobe would feel less than ideal about the blanket of liquid that engulfed them.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) bonked the boy on the head and immediately fell asleep right after. She was really tired today after being tortured and traveling to another village. But the sudden loud noise of a splash woke her up in confusion, which woke up Fubuki again. Once more she looked around and realized...Meixun must&#39;ve done a technique!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, so you wanted to show me this r--&#34;</font>

She looked down and saw the boy on the water, simply floating. Not moving. At all.

<font color = white>&#34;MEIXUN?!&#34;</font>

Fubuki went down to grab him in a hurry, desperately trying to pull him up...she thought she had killed him. Even though she was older, the girl wasn&#39;t that strong physically. All she ended up doing was falling towards the pool of water as well, right next to Meixun.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) felt like he just watched a murder play out in slow motion. He wasn&#39;t drowning, right--?
A slant of posture permits him a view of the boy floating in the water face up. Good. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve killed him in board daylight. Merciless,&#34;</font> he told her, despite being able to tell the kid was breathing even from this distance. </font></font></font>

He looked at his ruined undershirt, realizing that he&#39;s just soaked one of his favorite clothes for a shinobi technique.... A frown pinched on his lips before he turned over to Shuye, <font color = white>&#34;Daole shenme daole shenme?&#34;</font> He chanted eagerly.

It&#39;s been a while since either of the Zhu siblings brought up their youngest sister, so whatever the eldest got must&#39;ve been very sentimental.

Now she started actually panicking. She put her hands where the boy was, as if thinking he somehow turned into water.

<font color = white>&#34;M-Meixun? I didn&#39;t hit you that hard did I- AHHHH!&#34;</font>

Fubuki was startled by Meixun&#39;s chanting, who had made it to the other side -- it was like seeing a ghost. Then she blinked twice. Ohhh, Kawarimi, right. Fubuki slowly got up and sighed, now all her clothes were wet - great.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah you&#39;re...uh, you&#39;re welcome...&#34;</font> she sighed while sitting on the floor. Atleast she did help him, technically.</font></font></font>
