Given that his father was no longer present... He could, allegedly, speak his mind. He still pauses for a moment. Taking an almost paranoid look around before simply backing up and over towards Old Man Tooki.

Once there, he takes a second to wave to Chobina and call out,

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah! Nice to meet you Chobina! I&#39;m Utsuwa Hideo!&#34;</font>

Before leaning towards the old man and muttering quietly.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;gumo gumo!....&#34;</font>

It suddenly began to expand ouwards behind her before she send it forwards in almost a blur towards the target grapsing hold of it!

<font color = white>&#34;pistol!&#34;</font>

SHe paused for a moment as she spoke there after as she laughed a bit nervously under her breathe.

<font color = white>&#34;this is the partial expansion technique you can learn at once you graduate. It uses our calories..per say mhm..so you will be feeling hungry afterwards. Il give a more technical explination when your actually learning the technique...as this is just a show case after all mhm!&#34;</font>

After a few moments her hand later crushed the target.

&#34;</font>Oh that looks very promising. So we will eat up our calories to use out techniques. Is that why your so small? You dont use to mant of them?&#34;</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mhm...i was small...b-but i recently had my growth spert!...n-no wait..maybe im still small by akimichi standards mm

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I mean your not even 18 yet right? Im sure you will grow tall~
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would begin to demonstrate the next technique.

<font color = white>&#34;p-pfft...i hope so...&#34;</font>

She paused as she began to demonstrate her next technique. Though felt defeated by the fact that she might not or might grow taller...mm..not that she minded....models were usually tall no?

A-ah focus koume focus!

<font color = white>&#34;il take a few steps back...watch closely...&#34;</font>

She would say as she moved backwards..and began to speak..a hand rose up to be placed infront of her mouth. It opened and the placed her thumb on it and began to blow.

<font color = white>&#34;gumo gumo!!!!&#34;</font>

She began to suddenly expand into a circular ball.

<font color = white>&#34;Balloon!&#34;</font>

She began to roll around in a circular motion aiming to lap her peers...and detroying the earth at their feet. However after a few moments she stopped....being envoloped in a cloud of smoke..and falling down from the air..once it cleared.

Upon landing on her feet..she continued her lecture. <font color = white>&#34;This is the human boulder technique...mostly using our calories as well...it allows us to expand our torso to become a ball so we can roll on our enemies. We can also use this while expanded..in which uses a higher level of calorie control...which is more for a chunins use case&#34;</font>

She paused before continueing once more. 

<font color = white>&#34;theres also the spiked meat ball version of this technique..however your control over your calorie drain must be immaculate or you just end up hurting yourself in the process. For the exact reason..il let you one when its time mhm&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She looks up and thinks of the possibilities. <font color = white>&#34;Using all these calories will make us pretty small thought. Like we will lose all of our stored fat if we sustain them.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: oo impressive...Gear secondo..not bat at all mhm...and yep..its why we eat so much..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: But what id we drain to many calories... we wound be able to use our techniques right?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: but that brings me to our last technique which is our clans form of taijutsu...called Harite...meaning sumo wresting...its why i practice the a subset  of it called judo when making attacks torwards oppoenents.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would step even further back before lowering to the ground..and pressing on it...visable markings slowly began to appear on her form..as she yelled..

<font color = white>&#34;h-ha!!!!&#34;</font>

suddenly the earth in the surrounding area began to shake...and suddenly...began to crack..as chakra began to be visably seen form her figure..taking the form of a golden yellow hue.

<i>CRACKLE crack!</i>

 However suddenly..it slowly began to go away..before she destoryed the place her clan trained in...Her chakra began to die down..becoming less visable and the markings that appeared began to fade away. 

<font color = white>&#34;if i didnt stop early..the ground would of been caved in...runeing our courtyard is a no go...on another note....this is called choharite....i dont think i need to explain what it does..no?&#34;</font>
