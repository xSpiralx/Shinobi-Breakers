He looks over to his rather large canine <font color = white>&#34;Kane did you hear that.. That pups name is Damuri.&#34;</font> 

The massive hound would bark a few times. The Inzuka would nod his head a few times <font color = white>&#34;Ha to funny Kane to funny.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only look at Nunya, as he would shake his head. <font color = white>&#34;Why would we know, when were not yet full shinobi?&#34;</font> he would then turn to the Inuzuka that was also the police chief, giving him a nod.

<font color = white>&#34;Well nice to officially meet you chief, names Himotachi, Sora, and this one is my brother Takuma.&#34;</font> they would point to the Ambitious one who had been a bit quiet till then.

<font color = white>&#34;A pleasure to meet you chief and aye, you seem quite straight forward.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...You speak dog?&#34;</font>, he asked, his eyes settling on the animal once again.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) has decided to take a walk from the compound of his clan to the Kage manor where he was supposed to sign up for the academy and figure out what is going on in this village nowadays. Since he became of age to join Shinobi ranks, Gosame was really excited and eager to meet new people.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what my boss would say to this...maybe I should wait for him?&#34;</font>

He would think while walking with his hands firmly placed at back of his head. Step by step he was slowly in front of the manor where he wonders what this group of people has gathered around for. In a friendly manner he smiles and joins them.

<font color = white>&#34;Erm...hello. I am Gosame and I am looking for someone to sign me up in the academy?&#34;</font>

Tall boy inquires, his skin was slowly turning blue as well due to their pigmentation that Hoshigaki get once when they become of age.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I see, well then I will have to go with secondary option....unfortunate.&#34;</font>

Gosame smiles to those that have introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to have heard at least one name...its nice to meet you Sora.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would shrug his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Right sure....I suppose.&#34;</font> honestly alot of them were quite interesting, but quite a bit out there as well as he would move towards the building sitting down on the sidewalk, leaning against it, as he opened up a bag and took out a book to read.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hm....I mean if you think like that, it could help you fight like you were prey....adrenaline shortcut maybe
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I am not an illusion? Is prey confused?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) sighs and shakes his head, ignoring the further comments of Yoru. This certainly was an interesting group of people, but he had no time for games. He would head to the front of the academy and wait for an instructor to arrive.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where did everyone go?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) was confused a little bit by the arrival of Yoru. He did not know how to teach his kin about the conversation and proper etiquette of other Shinobi in the village that they protect.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh...well....prey is something we hunt down and play with or hunt down and eat....but I am sure that Yoru doesnt mean it on a bad side.&#34;</font>

Gosame has begun to explain, he was wondering just why is Yoru constantly calling people prey. Was he not taught how to talk properly in public? Regardless, he didnt want to be a smartass and call him out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) would cough a few times Yoru&#39;s smell was crazy bad <font color = white>&#34;Hey.. This has to be a crime.&#34;</font> he says his eyes watering a bit.

His hound Kane would Bark at the Smelly teen.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only chuckle. <font color = white>&#34;Why do you think that I am all the way over here chief?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) looks to Gosame with a nod

<font color = white>&#34;Ah I get it...that&#39;s okay, if he treats his enemies as prey, he&#39;ll get along with me just fine!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: If he does not, big boss will put him in place.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only nod to them before turning to the chief. <font color = white>&#34;So, chief whats one gotta do to join the police force anyways, figured I would ask and see what happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's a good question
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Bad side? Prey is prey. No good or bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) stretched her arms over her hea, <font color = white>&#34;Huh.. where did everyone go?&#34;</font> She&#39;d wonder.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Everyone is here, few people left but thats about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) asks: Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looked at the hound, tilting his head.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, prey? Hungry? I&#39;m not prey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) looks over to sora. <font color = white>&#34;To join the force.. The minimum requirement would to be a genin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;We have a long path ahead of us, especially to become Genin. That one is really important.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read his book as he listened to the chief, when his question was answered. <font color = white>&#34;Well that is good to know chief, I might have to join when I am able to then...I think that with my skills I might be a great addition, but of course that also remains to be seen.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: My name?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Yep.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) tilted her head to the side as she eyed the sharp-toothed kid.
     <font color = white>&#34;My name&#39;s Reimi..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) gives Sora a heads up <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am Hoshigaki Gosame. Its nice to meet you Reimi.&#34;</font>

He says with wide and happy smile, he came here to meet new people and sign up to attend the academy and become Genin to begin with.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I knew she lied.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Reimi makes more sense.
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Obviously did you really think Nunya was their name?
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Do I look stupid to you
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Yes

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Nunya sounds like a prey name.

<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: You probably prey on boys

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Damn...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: A question though. Did anyone sign up at all? Because if not....we can just camp the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue reading as he flipped to another page. <font color = white>&#34;I believe that is exactly what we are doing currently Gosame.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I signed up!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would point to the big building everyone is infront of.. <font color = white>&#34;This is the accademy, but it was empty when I was inside just a bit ago, still it is good to know a name of someone to look for.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) points to the building next to them with his index finger.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) looks to the academy and back then blinks.

<font color = white>&#34;What in the...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Least no one was Gosame when I was in there last, and no one seemed to come in and out that I have seen, I can easily go look again
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Indeed it is still empty
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I need to start my training.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: We all have to train hard in and out of the academy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (im sorry but uh Allies within 3 tiles of a Sarutobi are bolstered by their leadership, gaining +5 to strength, speed and stamina.

<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hai we will.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (Thats crazy.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (aye )

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: So many preys around now.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (yeah, was looking at trees and bam stumbled on that gem)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kotsuki, Damuri(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (kaguya looks broken)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Geto, Takeshi(The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (Even in their last moments , the greatest leaders can find a way to inspire. When taking Critical damage, the Sarutobi gains +1 Grade to speed when moving to defend an attack for an ally with the intention of taking damage. Should the member of the Sarutobi clan die from this, their allies will gain a second wind of the Will of Fire , recieving B chakra and recovering Light to their current health.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (kaguya might seem good but sarutobi seems straight gorked)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders while wondering about what Yoru was talking to them about. Calling people <font color = white>&#34;prey&#34;</font> is not something that should be done in public but Gosame had no say in it.

<font color = white>&#34;Yoru...one day you will call someone prey and they will beat you up. Be careful.&#34;</font>

Gosame would say with worried tone, thinking that Yoru might have some sort of brain damage.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read as he would look at the others, he had studdied about various applications and so fourth just basic information on different techniques.

<font color = white>&#34;That is a good question, I will have to talk to big boss in what we excell in and all that. Probably suiton? We are sharks afterall.&#34;</font>

Gosame would say while moving his left hand to his chin in order to think.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) quickly nods his head,

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Then I shall fight the prey and it shall be fun!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would nod to the others, he had heard what they wished to specialize in, as hee would continue to read. <font color = white>&#34;I plan to master the blade, as well as use my formidiable mind to enforce my will on others.&#34;</font> he would say this casually.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would flip to another page casually. <font color = white>&#34;Well we wait, untill the instructor appears for thoose of us who have yet to sign up for the academy Reimi.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;I usually go for a swim when I am bored but...I guess you guys cant reach the depths where I go. But waiting for the instructor is also a thing, so who knows, one might pop up at any given moment.&#34;</font>

Gosame has said just to walk over to the wall and lean onto it.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Good night)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) wonders about the goals of other people that were in the area.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: To learn!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: To fight!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Kill enemy Shinobi
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Fight a lot, get money
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Die trying
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Pfffff...who's going to kill you? Konoha Shinobi? They are weak.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Prey will always be prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: And prey must someday fall
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods towards Yoru, he understood him completely. Other villages were prey but not their friends.

<font color = white>&#34;Remember Yoru. People we protect are friends, prey is outside the walls.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Everyone is prey. Inside or out?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: We just protect these prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But we do not call them prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: You know, the mutual respect and all.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (finally more free)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Respect is earned, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: They have earned it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: They have?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But big boss will tell you more about it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) emreged from the mist after having made their way through the village to the suspected Academy. The gathered youth outside certainly was a good sign on that account.

And by extension further my medical skills?&#34;</font> the voice came out muffled under the heavy bandages across their face. Even as they lifted a hand in greeting that was heavily waited down by the sleeves of their top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Yep.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: This is for learning, prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Sizuken didn't say anything earlier?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: I havent seen pops yet but....I am not sure. If you calling people prey causes issues you might have to stop it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But I am not going to force it unless it causes issues.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: He was here earlier, introducing strong prey instructor.

He&#39;d blink a few times at the newest arival as they seemed to have trouble finding the acadmey. The young man then has a thought <i>Hmm maybe they should put up some signs I think that would help these pups out bit.. Might even decerease the loittering around here.

He then looks off into the distance for a moment. 

His hound too would tilt it&#39;s head and look back at his brother from another mother for a moment. Mosai would simply nod his head causing the large hound to run off.

The movement looked stiff and uncomfortable to be sure. <font color = white>&#34;You can be prey. I do not intended for anyone to make me into a snack anytime soon.&#34;</font>

the long sleeves of their top fluttered in the wind as they addressed the other boy. <font color = white>&#34;You will be forgiven this time. The next offense I will hold a grudge when you one day come to me for medical care.&#34;</font>
