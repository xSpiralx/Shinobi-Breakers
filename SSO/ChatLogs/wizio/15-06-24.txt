<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) As Daigen made his way through the training grounds, he noticed a small, tranquil body of water nearby. The surface was still, reflecting the cloudy sky and the surrounding trees with mirror-like clarity. Drawn to the calmness of the scene, he walked over and stood at the water&#39;s edge, gazing at his own reflection.

For a moment, he stared into his own eyes, seeing the determination and resolve that had driven him through countless hours of training. The reflection seemed to challenge him, a reminder of the strength he was striving to achieve.

<font color = white>&#34;Time to push myself even further,&#34;</font> he murmured to himself.

Taking a deep breath, Daigen stepped back from the water&#39;s edge and assumed a fighting stance. He began to practice shadow sparring, imagining an opponent in front of him. His movements were precise and fluid, each punch and kick executed with perfect form.

He moved swiftly, his fists slicing through the air as he threw a series of rapid punches. His legs followed with powerful kicks, each one controlled and focused. The reflection in the water provided a silent audience, mirroring his every move.

Daigen shifted his stance, incorporating dodges and counterattacks into his routine. He visualized his imaginary opponent&#39;s moves, reacting with speed and agility. His body moved instinctively, the countless hours of training evident in his fluid motions.

As he sparred, Daigen&#39;s mind focused entirely on his movements. The world around him seemed to fade away, leaving only the sound of his breath and the rhythm of his attacks. He pushed himself harder, his strikes becoming more intense and powerful.

Occasionally, he glanced at his reflection, using it as a guide to correct his form and technique. The still water provided a unique perspective, allowing him to see his own movements from a different angle. He adjusted his stance and strikes, ensuring each one was as effective as possible.

Minutes turned into an hour as Daigen continued his shadow sparring. Sweat began to bead on his forehead, but he paid it no mind, his focus unwavering. He practiced a variety of techniques, from basic punches and kicks to more complex combinations and maneuvers.

Finally, after an intense session, Daigen paused to catch his breath. He stood at the water&#39;s edge once more, his reflection now showing a shinobi who had pushed himself to the limit. The calmness of the scene contrasted sharply with the intensity of his training, creating a sense of balance and harmony.

<font color = white>&#34;One step at a time,&#34;</font> he repeated to himself, feeling a renewed sense of determination.

With a final nod to his reflection, Daigen turned away from the water and began to walk back towards the training grounds. He felt a deep sense of accomplishment, knowing that he had taken another important step on his journey to becoming one of the strongest shinobi Amegakure had ever seen.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) waves at the group in the area before resuming his training regiment. 

The boy had plenty of time to increase his skills for the upcoming duties he would have a ninja so he would take advantage of it.

With swift movements, he throws a flurry of attacks..Some were sloppy, some were crisp but the more he continued to train, the better they became.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Wait wait wait... What...?&#34;</font>

He would raise his hands up and push away anything she would try to offer him.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you think I&#39;m a begger...?&#34;</font>

He looked himself over for a minute, he looked fine as far as he saw, his hair was just a bit messy, not dirty.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhm...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s focus remained unwavering amidst the chaos that often swirled around him. While his classmates indulged in various extracurricular activities, he remained singularly dedicated to forging a path towards a stronger future. The petty distractions of others held no sway over his ambitions or principles.

His determination to establish a solid foundation for himself was palpable, driving him to hone his skills relentlessly. Whether in combat training or mastering advanced techniques, Sogeki pushed himself with unwavering discipline. The fleeting pursuits and diversions of his peers were inconsequential in his pursuit of mastery and excellence.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me,&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the ambient noise, his tone laced with arrogance and confidence as he turned to the dark-skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;How does one earn the honor of becoming your first and most important pupil?&#34;</font> His gaze locked onto hers, challenging and expectant, as if daring her to recognize his potential and skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) rubs the nape of his neck and looks off over to the comotion to his left. His posture was one of faint exhuasion.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;N-no... It&#39;s just my hairstyle and I like it... I don&#39;t need a haircut.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d proceed to raise his hands up to cover his head and protect his hair from the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Mugen, Yurei (The long-haired boy-Mirageman) kept his hands to his side and then looked over with a light smile to those of his right. His long tied hair swayed in the soft undiffused evening breeze.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had returned to her place, and stood there once more with her hands nestled behind her back. A poised stance, one of experience past her years, and it honestly showed. 

She didn&#39;t even make notice of the young lad drowning - he would learn to swim, or he would sink. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? My methods are harsh, brutal, and often end the lives of those wishing to learn to become like me if they survive? Often more then not they are crippled. Train, and show me that you can survive - then we can see,&#34;</font>

She answered simply.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) When the soft spoken lass leaped in to the water, they&#39;d see the white-haired boy with his legs and arms crossed relaxing in the water. As if taking a break before decided to resurface.

A wave given and then <font color = white>&#34;..hllphb.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say as air bubbles escaped his mouth when speaking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do not baby Genin, I am not here to coddle you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) 
As Daigen left the tranquil training area and walked towards the busier parts of Amegakure, he soon found himself in a crowded marketplace. The vibrant energy of the village was palpable, with merchants calling out their wares, villagers chatting animatedly, and children running about. The contrast to the solitude of his training ground was stark, but Daigen moved through the crowd with ease, his senses alert and focused.

His attention was drawn to a dark-skinned woman standing in the center of the bustling crowd. She had an air of confidence and charisma that seemed to captivate those around her. The crowd’s attention was firmly fixed on her, and she spoke with a commanding presence that demanded respect.

Daigen didn't approach her directly. Instead, he found a spot nearby where he could observe without drawing too much attention to himself. Leaning against a wall, he watched as the woman engaged with the people around her. She spoke passionately about something, her gestures animated and expressive. 

He tried to discern what she was saying from a distance. Her voice, though clear, was drowned out by the general noise of the market. However, her body language and the reactions of the crowd spoke volumes. She appeared to be a figure of some importance or influence, and the villagers seemed to hang on her every word.

Daigen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he observed. He noted the way she commanded the space around her, the way people leaned in to listen, the respect evident in their expressions. There was something about her that intrigued him, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. 

His thoughts wandered as he considered the possibilities. Who was this woman? What role did she play in the village? Was she a shinobi, a leader, or perhaps someone with a different kind of influence? 

For now, Daigen chose to remain an observer. He knew that understanding the people around him, especially those who commanded such attention, could be crucial. He continued to watch, taking in every detail, from her expressions to her interactions with the crowd.

Though he didn’t make a move to approach her, Daigen stored away this moment in his mind. One day, it might prove useful to know more about the influential figures within his village. For now, he would remain in the background, learning what he could from the shadows.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) begins to laugh a bit<font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t know people went outside like that on purpose......are you like rebeling against your family or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) shook his head silently as he turned toward the ongoing conversation between who he'd assumed to be the instructor and his peers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Then again.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) blinked again slolwy, at this point he was beginning to get self conscious about his hair, was it really that bad?

<font color = white>&#34;No... I love my family. What&#39;s wrong with my hair? I think it looks cool, I go out every day looking like this.&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t know how to deal with this, he had never experienced this sort of interaction before.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do believe I have to teach some method of fundamental Taijutsu and Kenjutsu.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) gave the white-haired boy a dumbfounded look, before pouting as she&#39;d fold her arms.
The boy was likely a Hozuki, Shinobi of Water.
<font color = white>&#34;Well crud...&#34;</font> She&#39;d think, seeing how her help wasn&#39;t even neccessary.

Then, the realization set in further, and she couldn&#39;t help but smile at the boy, waving back at him before pointing up, as she decides it was best to leave the boy in his &#39;area of expertise&#39;, and to have some fresh air, herself, climbing out of the water, soaking wet, afterwards.</font></font></font>

Caught off guard, Sogeki&#39;s left eyebrow quirked in surprise, and he fell into a deafening silence. He scrutinized Daigen for a solid minute, weighing the request and considering the implications.

Finally, Sogeki shrugged nonchalantly and extended his arm towards Daigen. <font color = white>&#34;If we train together, that makes us one step closer to being brothers. You understand that, right?&#34;</font> His tone was serious yet tinged with a hint of camaraderie. <font color = white>&#34;Only thing left is a nice cup of sake to seal the deal.&#34;</font>

With that, Sogeki presented Daigen with a fist bump, a gesture of solidarity and acceptance of the partnership Daigen had proposed. It was a rare moment of openness from Sogeki, acknowledging the potential bond that could be forged through shared training and mutual respect.</font></font></font>
