<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Where are your shoes, child?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: Hm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) glanced down at her feet. While she didn&#39;t wear traditional &#39;shoes&#39;, there were several wraps that kept her soles from constantly touching the ground.

     <font color = white>&#34;These&#39;re good enough. Don&#39;t want to waste ryo on something I&#39;m going to mess up a lot..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Waste ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Are you poor?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Nah. Just would rather spend that money on other things.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Its not a big deal, is it?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If I were to invite you into my office, you would drag dirt everywhere with your unwashed, scummed feet.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your task will be to take someone's shoes. Forcefully.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Failure to do so will result in punishment from myself.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) tapped a finger against her cheek. Not once did the youth consider the &#39;downsides&#39; of her lack of proper footwear. Then again, she never really imagined herself walking into someone&#39;s office. Dirt could always be cleaned, couldn&#39;t it?

     <font color = white>&#34;Well...&#34;</font>

She paused, her eyes scanning the adult. It was the <i>third</i> time someone above her age gave her a command. While the other two resulted in a reward, this one.. It seemed like she didn&#39;t really have a choice. It wasn&#39;t like her to go against the wishes of elder shinobi.

<font color = white>&#34;That sounds kind of easy.&#34;</font> she comments.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) settles both arms behind his back and observes the girl with a scrutinizing glare. <font color = white>&#34;If you make it so,&#34;</font> he starts and pivots to scan the surrounding area, <font color = white>&#34;What is your name? I must make note.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Tsukiko.&#34;</font> she responds plainly. She turns her head, her eyes also glancing about the small gathering of people. Unrecognizable villagers. Passerbys..

But then her eyes catch wind of a certain unmistakable individual.

     <font color = white>&#34;Hey. Short stuff!&#34;</font> she calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) begins a slow departure. <font color = white>&#34;As you were then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: What do you want?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) asks: Is there anything to want from you, old guy?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your tongue is sharp but your teeth are not. You will be made example.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) folds his arms, appearing rather sheepish once his developmental flaw had been pointed out. The prepubescent sharkling looks down.

<font color = white>&#34;H-hey.. My teeth are still growing. You don&#39;t need to tell everyone else about that..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) takes a few steps closer to the blue-skinned boy. A blur is made before the sound of a thunderous smack occurs.
The boy had been slapped by speeds far greater than they could perceive.

<font color = white>&#34;<i>Silence.</i>&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) feels the sting of a thunderous slap echo across his face. Its sheer speed sends the preteen unconscious before he could process what happened!

All of this, just for greeting his superior... Was this, the feeling of discrimination against the blue-skinned folk?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You are learning.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You do not address me as old guy.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You call me Commander.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) says: Nngh...
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If you understand then nod.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) opens half an eye lid. It just barely fixes his vision onto the Uzumaki. 
  <i><font color = white>&#34;C-Commander..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) looked upwards from the ground. His head moving as slightly as it could.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Come with me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#657c93>Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) takes some time to get up to his two feet. He silently follows behind his superior.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Onisame(The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) OOCs: (am following)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (word)
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: You just.. suddenly go deaf or something?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Both of you.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: Hm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) gestures a hand toward the blue-skinned boy. <font color = white>&#34;Beat him. You may take his shoes too.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) yells: ...?!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: ...!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Onisame (The blue-skinned boy-TheJaganEye) yells: Don't be fooled.. This is a test.. He'll slap you too...!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: ???
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) looked confused as he manage to fall into a daze. <font color = white>&#34;Oh no this time of day the current isn&#39;t strung.&#34;</font> he replied.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) diverts her attention from the now shoeless reserved youth. Her eyes rest on the blue-skinned boy, primarily towards the shoes he adorns.

     <font color = white>&#34;..You ready?&#34;</font> she inquires.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) jumped up to face the stature of the crimson-haired vet and gave a salute. <font color = white>&#34;Eh... good day sir!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good day. You may refer to me as Commander. Nothing else.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) keeps his hands behind his back and steps away to the side. <font color = white>&#34;You may begin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Oh, okay yes Commander.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu(The reserved boy-Kryu) OOCs: (I've been dozing on and off... what are we doing?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (rob this blue kid)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (doesnt have to be real combat since im sure u guys have E stats)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko(The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) OOCs: (Did the blue homie pass out?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (he just afks often)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko(The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) OOCs: (Fair enough.)
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Hmm
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Well I suppose I must follow orders.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: Forgive me... for this...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) sprinted forward towards the hoshigaki while launching a senbon toothpick in his direction. Hopefully it was enough to throw him off-guard as he begun his assault.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) pivots and turns away to depart. He leaves them to their devices. <font color = white>&#34;The blue one is not allowed to fight back. Do not break his bones. We need to keep our soldiers in shape. Stop the fight when he draws blood.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: What'cha doin'?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: You asked me a question?
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Oh, I was just askin' what you were doin'.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: How rude of me not to answer.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I was only waiting.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: What'cha waitin' on?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Results.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) slides into a seat near the girl and casts his gaze forward. <font color = white>&#34;Do you understand the importance of results?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) curiously regarded the man. She hadn&#39;t really seen him around much, but he carried an aura of authority. Her head slowly turns to make eye contact with the Uzumaki as she ponders her answer whilst humming softly.

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d reckon there isn&#39;t much point in exerting effort wihout producing results, yeah?&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) nods in agreement. He holds up a single finger. <font color = white>&#34;You are correct. Results are the most important thing to a shinobi.&#34;</font>

He shifts in his seat.

<font color = white>&#34;It is all that will <i>ever</i> matter on the battlefield. That is my first lesson to you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) stopped humming altogether as the elder shinobi spoke. By using context clues and taking a closer look at the man the girl was able to realize his position.
    <font color = white>&#34;I see, is that why there&#39;s that one saying...history is written by the victor?&#34;</font>

   She canted her body slightly to more properly face the Uzumaki; a sign that she was diverting her full attention to this conversaiton.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) offers another simple nod. She is a good listener. A decent seedling. <font color = white>&#34;Most certainly. Tell me your name, seedling.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Nahoko.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Nahoko. You may call me Commander.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Commander...what?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is all.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Okay Commander that is all.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) giggles.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko(The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) OOCs: (The vein appears on his head...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (LOL)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) reveals only a thin grin. Humor is accepted. Disrespect would not be tolerated however. <font color = white>&#34;Yes, yes.&#34;</font> he joins along with a chuckling grunt of his own. <font color = white>&#34;I look to forge iron-born soldiers of this class of students. You will often see them battling one another. Can you give me a guess as to why I&#39;ve ordered such?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) tilted her head from side to side as she weighed his words. 
   <font color = white>&#34;Well with the threat that happened at the bridge i&#39;d assume you want to make sure everyone understands what they&#39;re signing up for...&#34;</font> she pauses, seeing if he&#39;s still listening, <font color = white>&#34;It sounds like there&#39;s some shady stuff happening and the world is coming to a boiling point around us with this hidden orb that abducts and kills kids and what not. The stakes seem to be quite high...&#34;</font>

     Nahoko was idly twirling her hair around her thumb as she looked from place to place, trying to organize her thoughts, <font color = white>&#34;You want to make sure everyone understands authority and will be capable of following orders so that they don&#39;t mess up and become another missing person?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) gifts her yet another nod before rising from his seat. <font color = white>&#34;Your thoughts are good. Some points are correct. It is not to avoid becoming a missing person however. The fighting is, however, to ensure quick-snap action is taken when an order is barked. Some times the enemy could be a comrade.&#34;</font>

He settles both hands behind his back and moves to depart. It is time to check on results.

<font color = white>&#34;Study well, Nahoko. And pay close attention at all times. I enjoyed the talk.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Of course, hope you find the results you were lookin' for.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Meh, I could jus' help you strong-arm someones shoes.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Preferably not my cousin's, but yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: There were a bunch of people around earlier but they were all half asleep..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu(The reserved boy-Kryu) OOCs: (my turn to RP right?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Damn. I know I saw that child from last night you gutted speaking to a masked dude.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Craaaazy~ stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: --Wait, just now?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Maybe uh - ten or so minutes ago.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: That little.. That just means he tried ignoring me earlier!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: You've gotta show me where!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sure, he should still be over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) continued with his pursuit with the intent of closing the distance. It wasn't like he wanted to engage in combat. Infact it was under the order of the jounin to collect the shoes. However anyone absent when the order was given would have lost the contexts of the fiasco. 

Sprinting forward in sporactic manner, another flick of the wrist had sent another toothpick forward. If only he'd learn some suiton jutsu... maybe then he'd be able to bring this foolish chance to an end.

Once again, he side steps the incoming projectiles while in motion towards the water. Instead of hitting his ankles, they touch the ground. <font color = white>&#34;Hozuki boy. Lay off me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Oyi!&#34;</font>

The pursuit after the hoshigaki would die down as he faded into the distance and depths of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Sir may I make a request of either a kunai or senbon?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Her hands moved from their pointing, relaxed positions and instead dropped to her side. Just like the day(s) prior, they slowly began to curl themselves into fists. She took a singular step forward, the wraps around her soles pressing against the concrete.

     <font color = white>&#34;Just don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you an out, runt!&#34;</font>

It takes only a jolt for her to take off into a full fledged sprint. Step after step is made in dangerous approach of the youthful one. With her target locked, there wasn&#39;t exactly anything going to stop her from making her way over to them.

Just how would they respond?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would turn around, staring at the afro haird child as he seemingly ripped off a piece of cloth with his clan&#39;s crest on it. The masked figure didn&#39;t even move his arm upwards to take the cloth. Instead, he would look straight through the sole of the Uzumaki.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need a piece of cloth to summon you. If I find myself in need, I will take The Commander above a Student. Like I have said before...I am watching you all.

<font color = white>&#34;I won&#39;t be bullied by some hag!&#34;</font>, he said defiantly, attempting to weave a set of handseals. If successful, two clones of the child would appear in a puff of smoke on each side of him.  Though they would not move, as if all were frozen in place with fear of the impending strikes.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) That gap between them closes in mere moments. She nigh skids before them, her clearly experienced hands already working at her side. Initially, the entire ordeal was something she only did out of demand and fear or reprimandation. A violently, horrific word slams into her ears. It was the same word that caused the situation from last night. It was the same word that powered up those dangerous fists of hers.

And it would be the same word that solidified the amount of damage she&#39;d inflict upon the cold youth.

As his hands come together to formulate those seals, one of her own mixes between the two to slap them out of order. There wouldn&#39;t be a puff of smoke or any clones-- only the fiery wrath of the blonde as she forcibly entered his space. 

     <font color = white>&#34;<i>Sabrosa!</i>&#34;</font>

Her other hand extended downward, a violent push aimed towards the youth&#39;s face to shove him into the ground. Excessive, sure.. but he&#39;d certainly asked for it.

His face would widen with horror, as he braced himself knowing full well what would come next. 

Before he could process the next movement, a hand would grab the top of his head, causing his face to slam into the concrete with a violent force. The blood curdling scream of a child would erupt from him, as the stern concrete mashed the soft bits of his facial flesh with his skull.

He would lay there severly bruised with blood leaking down their small forehead. He would feebly raise his arms to the ground attempting to before passing into unconciousness. Though in the instant before he would curl into a fetal position grasping his shoes with all his strength even in his unconscious state.

There wasn&#39;t an ounce of restraint in it, clear by the lack of worry or response from the blonde as their face bounced on the pavement. She stood above him, her hands still twitching with the anticipation of more. Clearly, their last exchange of blows didn&#39;t teach the cold one anything.

Fortunately, despite this rage, she wasn&#39;t some sort of psychopath.

Those jittering palms made their way to the cold youth&#39;s shoes. That cry and the surrounding blood were, yet again, idly ignored as she took to reaching down towards those shoes. Clutch as much as they&#39;d like, she pulled and pried those two straight from his feet.

With them in tow, she took to holding them both with a singular hand; her index and middle finger capable of hoisting them up. She immediately about faces, her attention already upon the instructor of said punishment.

She noted blood, blood touching her pavement - ruining her street and it caused her to briefly chuckle. 

   <font color = white>&#34;As stated before, anything done to the village will be applied to you - and I see blood on the street,&#34;</font>

Even in the view of a higher-up, she didn&#39;t truly care and suddenly she moved to curve her hand around and lurch a singular fist towards the stomach of the Student. It wasn&#39;t designed to inflict injuries, just a subtle method to ensure they remember.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) All in all, the blonde believed everything to be handled. She had obtained her mission objective; the small one had been punished for their injuries. All was <i>mostly</i> right with her world.

    <font color = white>&#34;See that, Beisame? That&#39;s how you--&#34;</font>

Unfortunately, that lock onto familiar faces cost her. Before she could even finish her sentence or identify the attack, a devastating shot rocked the tanned one&#39;s midsection. She immediatly lurched forward, her grip upon the boy&#39;s sandals <i>nearly</i> releasing from that shot of pain.

All of the energy within her body was forcefully knocked out of her. She nigh crumbled just from that singular strike alone-- forced to shaky knees. If the dancer wasn&#39;t holding back, it was certain that the blonde would have been reduced to the same unconcious state that she left the cold youth.

     <font color = white>&#34;W-Wait.. I-I&#39;m..&#34;</font> She tried to speak.. but that fresh damage made it impossible to formulate a sentence. Pained, weakened eyes mixed with her expression to convey a message;

Regret.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had already shifted, and turned in place - agile grace, and practiced movements could be noted while her hands instantly moved behind her back and furled into a locked grasp. 

She seemed as if nothing had occured. 

   <font color = white>&#34;When you can stand again, please do ensure that blood is cleaned up - and try not to let the Yuki die,&#34;</font>

The soft thuds of bare-feet with trimmed cloth could be noted while she eased back to her original location. She had finished what she needed to finish.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) throughout the use of the convienient diversion made by the higher up, Nahoko approached the profound blonde and looked down at her.
   Slowly, yet surely the girl bent over and grasped at the blonde's sandals. Without making much sound she attempted to yank the smelly things free of her feet before taking off like a bullet in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>

As he noticed the girl with blonde hair grasping the sandals of his good friend. Jinbeisame was not one to sit idly by as his friends were getting messed with. In such, the boy closed the distance from his previous position to the girl with blonde-hairs side.

The blue-scaled hand of the Hoshigaki grasping their wrist with somewhat decent strength. No where near his friends - but enough. With a face as dead-pan as the Uzumaki behind him, he began speaking.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) To say she was unconcious was an overstatement. She might not have been standing upright but she <i>was</i> sentient of her surroundings. As that hand reached towards her mission objective, her hand instinctively came down towards her torso where she clutched the two sandals.

     <font color = white>&#34;H-Hands.. off..&#34;</font> she called out as she slowly managed to rise to a standing position. Still dazed, she took note of <i>yet another</i> elder who brandished their prowess and power. Unfortunately, the blonde wasn&#39;t in any state to argue. She gave only a slow nod of understanding whilst her free hand nursed the freshly inflicted blow to her core.

     <font color = white>&#34;S-Shouldn&#39;t.. the so-called &#39;medic&#39; be helping this guy out..?&#34;</font> she inquired, her half-wrapped foot gesturing towards the Yuki covered in blood.</font></font></font>

He will grab two small bandaids,then place a fabric to the wound and keep it with the two bandaids.After the treatment was done he will simply wait for the unconcious person to awake,afterall he did what he can with his basic knowledge of the human body</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) shook out of her daze and approached the Commander at his behest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) pulls out a single hand, gesturing towards Tsukiko and her shark-kin companion. <font color = white>&#34;If you can not follow simple orders then you are of no use. What if who you think to be your comrade is actually a mole? A mole only I know of. You would ruin an entire mission and operation. Can you handle that much? From the looks, I can&#39;t tell.&#34;</font>

He peers over to Nahoko.

<font color = white>&#34;Nahoko has good comprehensing skill.&#34;</font> He gestures toward her now. <font color = white>&#34;If I told you to attack Tsukiko right now. What is expected of you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) looked to her left, her gaze surverying those present.
    <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d figure out who Tsukiko is and attack them. Hesitation to follow an order can be the difference between a won and lost battle.&#34;</font> 

   The girl recalled her previous conversation with the Commander where he&#39;d drilled home the same point.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and places their aching head in their hands. They did not like this lesson very much. This Uzumaki Commander was just as vicious as his elders had warned.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yeah, its a world of older people beating on younger people because they know they can.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: One day, the roles will reverse.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is entirely untrue.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) points to the ground in front of him. <font color = white>&#34;Come to me.&#34;</font> he says, both eyes locked onto the young Yuki.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) weakly gets to his feet, his legs wobbling beneath him. His equilabrium was still shaky following the vicious blow to his head. His eyes would lock onto the hag who had assaulted him for a second time, as he approached the commander. 

The small child would radiate an aura of hatred towards the fellow villager. In his mind plans and ruminations of vengeance against her already had begun to take hold.

He would carefully approach the red haired commander, staring up at him with their small stature.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes....Sir..&#34;</font>, he said, begrudgingly knowing that this man&#39;s order was the reason that he had been so viciously assaulted and beaten.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You were targeted and beaten.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: How do you feel?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Well my head hurts and I want to pay that ha...girl back.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) visibly twitches.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Good. You have potential.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Potential?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your shoes are in their grasp forever. After graduation, you are to take them back.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: How am I suppose to do that? She hits like a professional sumo wrestler.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm too small..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Figure it out.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Did he just call her a sumo wrestler...?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Do not become complacent.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep trying.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Just get bigger.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'll pay her back one day, no longer how long it takes.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You will keep burning in the furnace that is my command until you've become something worthy of being made a blade.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Am I understood?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Yes...Sir...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Sumo..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Enough of this weak persona. Shed it thoroughly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pinched at her own waist. She wasn't fat...

...was she?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You may leave.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) bows respectfully not wanting to be party to another beating. There was something about this elder man that unsettled him. His senses screamed at him to not anger this man, although he had not done or said anything outwardly hostile. It was just a feeling that he could not shake.

Turning to leave, he would glare at the profound blonde. His cold icy anger boiling over as he observed his shoes in her grasp. He would look down at his cold pale feet which were covered in dirt, as he grasped his fists and trembled.

<font color = white>&#34;You will pay...&#34;</font> ,he thought, as he walked around the 2 savages and stood next to Rose.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Another battle between you two will commence upon graduation.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (think to suggest that in disc to see if they like the idea XD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) When the Yuki walks past her, Tsukiko only gives him an arched eyebrow. What <i>would</i> convey confusion invites something else. A dare, almost, for them to try their luck once more.

     <font color = white>&#34;When they lose then.. What happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: It will happen again and again until you lose.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I'm off. Cease your battles in my absence.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) yells: See he didn't recieve a fist theres no foolin'! Come on Higane you'll be Ay-Ok! no foolin' ya dig?!

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: They are required to be that way, thin and nimble.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: They are also very effective as lethal weapons by proper medical ninjas.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Woah.. Its him..
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Now, for you Bill. What are the three main tools of a Shinobi? The most basic ones.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) looks down at her hands for a moment.
   <font color = white>&#34;Hm. Maybe this is one of those sayings, like-- <i>anything</i> is lethal in the hands of a shinobi,&#34;</font> she muses aloud. Confident in her findings, she plants her hands on her hips and definitively nods. <font color = white>&#34;Very cool.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Eeeeeasy.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Precisely that, my sharp-toothed gal!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) stood in front of Miss Botan, but their gaze shifted to the crimson-haired veteran and the task they gave them.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, Umm...Kunai, Shuriken and Log.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Log?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Huh.&#34;</font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: log isn't a tool..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: It can be.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Its passable.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I often throw trees myself.

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: For the Kawarimi justsu...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) sweats a little.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) yells: Praise the Log yo!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Only a little though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) quickly moved to do as she had done before, and produced a singular shiny-metallic item from within her sleeve. This time? It was a Shuriken, a singular Shuriken - it wasn&#39;t much but it was still free.

She handed it over.

   <font color = white>&#34;Continue,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) picked up the shuriken and palced it into their bag thanking the chuunin </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Suiton is countered by which of the four other elements?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Doton.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: and what counters Doton?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Katon..? Man I suck with elements.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh.. Dang.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) once more moved to produce an item from her sleeve, and this time it was the last of the fundamental three. A singular, freshly sharpened, and steel-carbon infused Kunai. 

It was basically a fancy knife, and she tossed it over towards the young man. 

   <font color = white>&#34;A Kunai,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked to the crimson-haired veteran before departing the image of a word in the young students' minds as they palmed the shuriken they were given and thought now was the time to try and receive the last item.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Jinbeisame, the genius of th'Hoshigaki Clan.

He feels the weight of someone's gaze upon him, a piercing stare trying to draw his attention. Keeping his arms folded across his chest, he remains outwardly composed, his expression unreadable.

His gaze drifts off into the distance, not directly meeting the source of the glare but aware of its presence. The atmosphere around him buzzes with energy, conversations blending into a low hum that he tunes out effortlessly. Sogeki's mind wanders briefly, contemplating the day's events and the tasks ahead.

Then, a movement catches his eye—a flicker of motion on the edge of the training ground. It's an interaction he hasn't seen before, unfolding with intrigue and curiosity. Intrigued, Sogeki's focus shifts, his analytical mind now fully engaged as he observes with a keen interest, temporarily forgetting the lingering sensation of someone's scrutiny.</font></font></font>

It was the stern bastard from a few days ago, the one who dared to challenge him openly. Without shifting his stance, Sogeki turned his attention towards the source of the voice, his eyes fixing on the shark-like boy.

Their eyes locked in a silent duel, each assessing the other with unspoken intensity. Sogeki's stare was icy, piercing, as if daring the other to meet his gaze head-on. He conveyed a silent challenge through his unwavering glare, a message of defiance and readiness to engage if provoked.

Despite the tension, Sogeki remained composed, arms folded across his chest, exuding an air of quiet confidence. He waited, patient yet vigilant, observing how the sharkboy would react under his unwavering scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the veteran,the commander, as they spoke, and he wondered what fate they had just doomed his peer to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stared blankly at Sogeki. He pushed his glasses up, the sunlight glinting off the lenses dramatically. He pointed, positioning his body sideways. <font color = white>&#34;You act like a robot. I&#39;d fight you now but alas...&#34;</font> He tilted is head down sadly, <font color = white>&#34;I am without shoes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was being chased?! This was no good. His rolling wasn&#39;t taking him far.
<font color = white>&#34;New plan.&#34;</font>

He was going to do the most unstoppable means of escape. Springing out of his ball form and then going completely still. Like a...like uhh...-like a STATUE!!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) The squint didn&#39;t leave Sogeki&#39;s face. The embedding threat that stands before him.. it rocks Sogeki&#39;s core. Naturally, he&#39;s shaking in his boots.. But he refuses to dishonor the Satetsu name by back down.

Sogeki stands strong-- and steps forward even stronger.

The aggressive lad accepts his fate.
  <font color = white>&#34;Ready to accept my consequences. I simply allow for at least a two on one opportunity. I wish for my father to recognize my body after this.. Commander.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Satetsu, Sogeki(The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) OOCs: (by backing*)
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: History books,Philosophical ones aswell
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) inched a bit forward.. still confused by what was developing infront of her, before asking. <font color = white>&#34;Help with what...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) approaches Sogeki and settles a large hand on their shoulder, his figure towering them easily. <font color = white>&#34;My soldiers do <i>not</i> yield. But I admire such personality.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The hunt will be retracted. Tell me your name.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (i am possessed

The weight of the veteran&#39;s hand on his shoulder is both comforting and imposing, a reminder of the authority he carries. Sogeki meets the veteran&#39;s gaze with a defiant glare, the flames of determination burning fiercely in his eyes despite the fear that churns within him.

He stands his ground, unwilling to show weakness despite the overwhelming presence of the veteran. Sogeki knows the importance of respect in the shinobi world, especially when facing someone of higher rank. Yet, beneath the surface, his resolve remains unbroken, a testament to his unwavering spirit amidst the intimidating atmosphere.

<font color = white>&#34;..of the Satetsu. But soon everyone will call me the Kraken Slayer.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If my soldier says they will obtain a title then that it is how it will be.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Do you understand?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stared in complete astonishment. Beginning to wonder if this boy named <i>Blast</i> was sent here by some cosmic entity.. Though - sleep or not.. Still or not! 

                         <b><i>HE HAD A JOB TO DO.</b></i>

Manipulating his body in such a dramatic fashion as if he was a <i>snake</i>. His presence looming over behind him. It was time. <b><i>Fifty damned Ryo was at stake!</b></i>
      <i><font color = white>&#34;Pin him down as I~...!&#34;</font></i>

The half-shark would grasp the top of his briefs, wasting no time before hopping over his body soon after. Delivering a <i>vicious</i> <b><i>WEDGIE</b></i>! Certainly giving Asa some flashbacks of his very own from the day prior. Landing over the boy he would stand proud. A grin sprayed over his face.

<b><i>The job.. was done.</b></i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Of course. Though it doesnt have a ring to it like "the Commander".. but it'll be renown.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) shrugged. She wasn&#39;t one to contest her higher-ups.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) landed pathetically and continued walking over towards his friend. His face sprayed in horror.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Have you ever tasted war? The feeling of a life being taken when the last breathe is made?
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (who did you wedgie
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Because Krakens, in the book, are invasive creature that do nothing but roam and rule the darkness. Amegakure, being the one true light that I will one day lead, must extinguish any and all darkness.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) <font color = white>&#34;Thirst to slay?&#34;</font>

Sogeki thinks for a moment, then shrugs. He eases into the comfort of the topic.
  <font color = white>&#34;I do.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;But not without cause. Even if it&#39;s frowned upon by the public.. if it needs to be done. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (so since he wasn't wearing underwear

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) nods. A good, solid answer. One with valuable foundations. A very good seedling in the making. These things are being noted.
That is his S-rank mission afterall.

The study each of them and gift them tasks and an environment that will benefit their growth.

<font color = white>&#34;Fine,&#34;</font> he starts, squeezing the boy&#39;s shoulder, <font color = white>&#34;Kraken Slayer must be earned.&#34;</font>

A punch occurs, far too fast to be seen by anyone around. It plants into Sogeki&#39;s stomach with cratering force.

His hand falls from the boy&#39;s shoulder, leaving them to relish in the impacts recoil.

<font color = white>&#34;Now. Why do I see someone giving wedgies?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) didn&#39;t care anymore. His face, having been pasted full of horror, stayed facing the ground. His tone speaking as if he was already dead.

     <font color = white>&#34;..Money.. For weapons..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) side-eyes the Hoshigaki whom had fallen victim to the bad example set by the laborer the day before. It was without a doubt that the Commaner was going to indeed enact some sort of wrath upon him for comitting such a heinous crime.

    Whilst everyone was looking towards the Hoshigaki Nahoko stole a moment to check up on her hair in the reflection of the monument north o fher.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh god..

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He's punching people like Miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: its a bad sight to see people doing everything for money
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Hide!!
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You have no choice but to.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) 's eyes were glazed over as he witnessed Sogeki get the air knocked out of him. So much abuse, so much pain. Is this what it means to be a shinobi?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) epicly fails at hiding behind Blast.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) trudged forward, as the command was given.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (yahoo jutsu r being added slowly!!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: ( who's ready to learn FTG AND RAIKIRI)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) steps to the side. She gives the half-shark a reassuring pat on the shoulder to help ease the woes he felt; unaware that he was about to get thwarted by the commander himself.
   <font color = white>&#34;I--.. oh,&#34;</font> she says, only to watch him leave on command.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) prayed he <i>at least</i> got the fifty ryo. To pay for his future medical bills or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) yells: PUNISH HIM!!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (LMAO
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Come over here, boy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) points menacingly at his attempted assaulter.

<font color = white>&#34;..ok.&#34;</font>
Then he waddles over at impecable speed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s body jerks forward as the veteran&#39;s fist slams into his stomach with brutal force. The impact sends a shockwave of pain through him, causing him to grit his teeth and stagger backward. His hands instinctively clutch at his abdomen, trying to alleviate the intense ache that spreads from the point of impact.

Despite the pain, Sogeki locks eyes with the crimson-haired veteran, his gaze unwavering. His pride refuses to let him show weakness or back down, even in the face of such a harsh lesson. He takes a deep breath, swallowing his pride along with the pain, and straightens up slowly, though the discomfort is evident on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand,&#34;</font> Sogeki manages to say through clenched teeth, his voice strained but defiant. He exhales sharply, willing himself to remain composed despite the throbbing pain in his gut. His eyes remain fixed on the veteran, a silent acknowledgment of the respect he holds for the commander&#39;s authority.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: One of you will be punished for unorderly conduct.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Higane.

<font color = white>&#34;You are a scared cat,aren&#39;t you&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The other will be punched in the stomach by Sogeki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) Walked quickly over to the scene about to happen. Someone other than him getting abused by their elder? A sight to behold.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) asks: What are the other options?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Drainage of your chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: ..I shall take th'brunt of both punishments, if possible.. I am th'cause.. I'll accept th'just rights..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Silence.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Pick one of the three.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: And here I thought shinobi were supposed to take jobs for money...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Th'former.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) stood there silently.

Then he broke the silence.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m confused. Do we still have to be silent?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) regretably shakes her head. <i>How far we have fallen.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) felt bad that Blast-san was being punished but could only watch from a distance as he couldn't save the boy from his fate.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: That'd be hard y'know. Since we have to verbally choose.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Shh...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: If you had like a piece of paper I could point to pick.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He hasn't noticed I was somewhat involved.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) remained otherwise idle as the Hoshigaki made his way through the gathering of shinobi. The actual act wasn&#39;t her end goal here. Unfortunately...

     <font color = white>&#34;Oh.. That&#39;s..&#34;</font>

When he walked back over, she observed his demeanor and that call he made-- She, too, widened her eyes with shock. Not one ounce of her wanted to imagine what that felt like. 

Before she could offer a hand or deliver his justice..

He was gone.

<i>It seems her point had been made.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) asks: Haginane over there also assisted his assault. Is that why we have three options?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) points at the pearl eye'd kid.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) scoots a step closer to the blonde.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) threw his arm around bill&#39;s shoulders, <font color = white>&#34;You know, Bill. Some people just have to learn the hard way not to be a nuisance. You know?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) ducks behind Najiro.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;And a oop!&#34;</font> She jolted in a muffled tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Don't you get why she is raising her tone.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: How dare he even speak at such volumes to you. He thinks you're too stupid to say someones name correctly.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I hope he doesn't hurt her too bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) claps his hands together. <font color = white>&#34;Enough. I&#39;ve decided. All three are to be hunted.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

    His arm sliding out of his sleeve as his upper body laid bare. Turning southbound to face Sogeki. The student granted the privilege of hunting and punching him. This was perfectly fine to him.

The neck of his cracked as he readied himself. His right hand raising itself, motioning in a &#39;<i>come on, then</i>&#39; gesture. Thus he spoke finally.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Hunt me? Fine then, let&#39;s do it. Punch me? Do it..</b>&#34;</font>, his finger pointed in Najiro&#39;s direction, his face grinning widely as he continued.
     <font color = white>&#34;<b>This is what it means t&#39;follow orders!!! I want you to hunt me with all yer might.. It&#39;s yer order, Najiro. Whether it&#39;s right or wrong - you commit to it!!!</b>&#34;</font>

               Finally, the gaze of the boy turned back to Sogeki, his grin spreading as his body flared up. His blue-scaled hand beated his chest as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;<b>Let&#39;s not hold th&#39;Commander up. Deliver yer blow.</b>&#34;</font>, he spoke. His hand gesturing to begin this matter, once more.</font></font></font>

Though respect is established and recognized to be mutual, duty calls. Sogeki cocks his arm back and sends it flying towards the aquatic hybrid.

<font color = white>&#34;..for the Commander,&#34;</font> Sogeki whispers.

The impact of his action is felt heavily in the tense silence that follows, hanging in the air as a testament to the Commander&#39;s authority and the consequences of crossing it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) thought about it. Questions. Questions are important. Questions get answers. Questions like 'How hard is he going to punch Haginini? Is the commander a man or woman? Where are my shoes?'</font></font></font>

        Moving along to the side, letting the next recipient take their turn in receiving the punch from the fellow student, Sogeki.
