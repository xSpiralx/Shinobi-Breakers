<br><font color=green>*Oiu (The slanty eyed boy-ScoobyTheDog) says: ahhhhhh
<br><font color=green>*Oiu (The slanty eyed boy-ScoobyTheDog) says: give me daily pl0x
<br><font color=green>*Oiu (The slanty eyed boy-ScoobyTheDog) says: dam
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not really
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its just what i want to study.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh okay.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than that...i need to perfect my control...and do some stuff too
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) stood by the monument at the square, not entirely sure what she should be doing right now, except, perhaps, mingling with the other students.

Orange eyes scouted the area, noticing not one, but two people, likely students as well.

Slowly, her hand would raise, an informal greeting by means of waving at the two was made.
<font color = white>&#34;Hello, are you both students, as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im a student.I belive the person with me is not,well..atleast not very interested in the shinobi life
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand. And likely an understandable feeling as well. For some, at least.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Weird, second DC...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Sorry about that... ^^; )
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not that much of a figther too
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: My name is Najiro,and i hope to be a medical ninja in the near future.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I wonder why I keep DCing..)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) began to make a formal bow this time, as the wishful student introduced himself.
<font color = white>&#34;My name is Hanamura. To be quite honest, I have multiple ideas of what I&#39;d like to move into. I was thinking, perhaps, Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, either balancing it out or having a primary and secondary focus. But of course, I am just a student, so I still have much to learn before I could even begin focusing on something - Or so I&#39;d wager.&#34;</font>

Her hand gently covered her mouth, a soft chuckle escaping her before her hand lowered again.
<font color = white>&#34;But a Medical Shinobi... Quite a, how should I put it... A very important position, at the very least. I hope you succeed in your dream, and I am sure you will if you put your mind to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I really apologise for these DCs...I think my internet is acting up...)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah.Ive had some basic traning into shurikenjutsu too.So hopefully im not too bothering if i ever go to a mission
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its fine
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Practice makes perfect. But it is a good idea to learn how to defend yourself, and potentially others, especially when near or in enemy environments and areas.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Have you learned anything in the academy yet?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Reseted the router/modem whatever. ^^;;; Should be fixed now I hope.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (alright
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I guess no?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Pardon? No to what?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hm...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Have you learned anything in the academy yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: That was my question,but you seemed zone out for a second
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, apologies. I'm... I guess I was a bit tired, but I should be fine now. - As for having learned anything, besides some of the village's history, I don't think I know much yet.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: I wonder, though, has the Festival of Water begun yet?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I don't think it has begun
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Though..i hope it will begin sooner or later.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Excited for it?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Though i need to watch out aswell.On that day i need to have atleast few shirts and pants
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) giggles softly, nodding her head.
<font color = white>&#34;Getting hit by water, or just getting drenched by it, is a hundred percent possibility, for sure. Unless you&#39;re good at dodging or, maybe, hiding.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,im traning my speed outside of my control with chakra,so we will see
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Though,how about you? Are you ready to be hit with water?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I can take it, but I will drench any who drench me, twice as bad. -- Don't ask me how, because I've yet to figure that part out... But all in good fun, of course.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm....Also
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is few students besides us who are around,but they seem kinda...very hardly focused on their stuff
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (aka afk)
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Oh? As in, slacking?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Could be they're taking a breather, though... Maybe they've been studying all day and night.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe.I tried to talk with them but they seemed kinda..zoned out
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Hm? I definitely did just zone out.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: What did I miss?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, hello. Just some talk about the Festival of Water, and our plans for, well, training?  I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: well we talked about the festival of water
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Oh okay. What's your name miss?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) makes a formal bow once more.
<font color = white>&#34;Apologies. I am Hanamura, a pleasure to meet you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Tenjin. The pleasure's mine.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: Are you interested in medicine too?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I would have to say no to Medicine, although I do find it impressive and important, I... Would likely be more on the front-lines and, per chance, the one needing medical attention.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) let out a soft, yet somewhat uncomfortable chuckle.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Well then you have found good luck in the form of the two men before you. Sounds like you should get to know Najiro well though since he will become one of the best medics.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) gave a few nods, smiling as she did so.
<font color = white>&#34;I am sure he will be, if his motivation holds and his dedication stands.
But, may I ask, from what I heared you, yourself, might not be as interested in training? Or did I missunderstand that?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I recently had it revealed to me by the head of the Hyuuga clan that I train more often than any academy student.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: My favorite things to do are think and imagine. He referred to those things as training the mind.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I will probably wind up making tools that you use. And he will probably wind up helping you recover.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh? So the opposite? Quite dedicated then? And I see... Well, if per chance you, either of you that is, are looking for a training partner, I would love to apply and offer to join in.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Oh? A Craftsman-in-Training, then? If I understand this well?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Yes. I like the way you speak. Always clarifying and checking for understanding is an intellectual virtue.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,if you will be craftsmen in the future,i will pay you a visit
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: I have no doubt that you will. I will be the best around after all.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: As will I. And thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: In any case..what we gonna do for now?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Perhaps the two of you could train together right now.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: All three of us would benefit from that.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: e-eh? You sure?
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Of course! 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: As in a sparring match? Or perhaps using tools, equipment, and the likes?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess as sparring parther.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: A match. Seeing what fights will look like will always help me.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) asks: How can I make good tools when I don't know anything about the trade?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Can we contact an admin for set-ups yet? Or is everyone at least at 3/3 points? ^^)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (weird,fishing rod doesn't have description
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (everyone is at 3/3 points
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Good!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (admins atm asleep but go ahead XD they can give you the starting perk for any specialization that doesn't requires prior perks
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That is a fair point, really. But where should we do such? Here, in public, people might not think well of it.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (kenjutsu and medic cannot be given sadly
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is places for it
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (neither can blacksmith)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (which sux)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Oh? You can't get a free spec for crafting?)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: West from here is fine
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (nope because it costs 20 points)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i cannot get free medic cause requires perfect control
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cannot get free ken either cause is 20 points
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Ah, okay. ^^)
<br><font color=red>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Well, then, let us go, shall we?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (huh
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: lets go then
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It's been a while since I played an NRP of this kind/rulesystem, so do bare with me. ^^)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) takes a seat on the ground with a huge grin on his face as he pulls out a notepad and a pen before watching the two of them with widened eyes of excitement.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (same XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i cannot find where was the rule about minimal range of char,so imma just say atm is 5 titles
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (That's fine!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (found it
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its 8 titles
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) inhaled deeply before letting out a long exhale.
Her stance would then be entered. It wasn&#39;t exactly anything out of the ordinary, it was pretty mild, inexperienced, but likely allowing more of a defensive movement than being more of an aggressive stance.

<font color = white>&#34;I am ready. But let&#39;s keep this as a training; No breaking limbs. I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to mention this, especially to someone educating themselves to be a medic, but, some people can get... Too into it, I guess?&#34;</font>

There she stood, ready to begin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I see..at any case,im ready
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Yay! Position Markers. No need for clothing to be put down. x) )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will begin to move too,he was slower,but still had somewhat of a fast reaction with them</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (tbh unlee you have projectile the speed stat atm isn't needed.For moving that is XD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) smirked, she'd change her pathing a bit, tilting lightly as she moves a diagonal path towards her opponent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would charge and go straight to her.After he did that he prepared for  the female next move</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) had her smirk fade slightly, a half-formed smile, if it could even be called that, was now visable.
The match would now actually begin, the two of them would clash, leaving any bystander to ponder who'd win.

But victory, for either, was still far away. It had only just begun!

Thus, Hanamura rushed towards the Medic, and just before reaching him would slide over the ground, reaching the boy only to follow up with a jab towards his right shoulder with her left fist.

[D Agility]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at the attack which was given.It was fast,very fast,but he dodged it,by some miracle,whoever he knew the next attack will hit him clearly.For that the man will go,drop a..fish rod? Why a fish rod.And go one step back.

He had a idea,definatly a idea,but would that work out,considering the woman had huge striking capabilities?

(1/1 evasion used,going back with 1 title and dropping fishing rod item)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) squinted her eyes as her opponent avoided her blow. A given, it was likely they'd be able to dodge, but would they last, however?

She heared something drop, but kept her focus on her opponent for now, even as he backtracked away from her.

She rushed forward once more, before aiming a palm-strike towards the back of her opponent's left shoulder, using her own right palm.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) blinked and then quickly shook his head to make sure that his eyes were not deceiving him in any way.

<font color = white>&#34;Turning his back to his opponent... to protect his fishing rod? No. Not to protect it... but I can&#39;t figure out why he would do that... Especially against someone as quick as Hanamura...&#34;</font> he muttered aloud as he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would be hit,a bit too hard than what he expected,but he was standing still.The man had a thought and a idea.With that they will rush in the nearby direction as they prepared the nessecary seals.

Just what the heck was their idea

(Taking moderate injury aka 1/2 hits to defeat me,1/1 evasion regained,going to the west with two steps afterwhich preparing to do kawarimi)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (how do u know the dmg?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i forgot its strength XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (i mean in general. i dont see it in the combat tab rn)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (its at discord

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (oh)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (but i was thinking agility = dmg
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Strength VS Durability with a minimum of Light Injury unless they have a body or monstrous body perk.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (so i guess is pety cause i got E+ end
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ah so light then sorry
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I don't have any jutsu yet. ^^;; )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (tbh you guys were too late,there is a rank which gives them out to any student
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (he gonna be tommorow so i guess later down.Its the basic three academy ones XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I figured. Oh well, admins will arrive eventually, too.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) was quite confused. How did her opponent already know a jutsu? Was she severely lacking in her studies? No, that couldn't be it... She was a good student, after all.

Shaking her head, she pushed the thought away. If she were able to rush in, fast enough, she'd likely be able to hold him down before he could finish his hand seals.

Thus, Hana rushed forth, aiming to leap onto the boy, hoping to grab him mid-leap and pull him with her onto the ground.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (a grab?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Grapple/Grab.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (So I guess a grapple, trying to pin you to the ground.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (ah..i mean we in equal strength so...guess no one can get out?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I suppose so.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (but i guess you win that one.It says i can use it when im struck,but grapple isn't strucking i guess XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It is, though.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It just depends on the calculations. I think?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (That's what's confusing me. ^^)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (...hmmm yeah,so you got more agi than me,so i guess you stop the handseals?\
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (like im confused aswell XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (If Handseal Speed = Agility then yes, as the order is Jujutsu > Ninpo as well. x) )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i fail then XD
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause i got e+ handseals
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Saw the woman rushing faster and faster,was she about to attack him? Nope,she grab him and put him down on the ground.Due to the sudden move he cannot finish the seals,neither break from the grab due to their untrained in martial arts body.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm..&#34;</font>He will begin to think outloud while looking for opportunity,his chakra was a bit drained,but he can keep going if nessecary</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) just reduced their chakra by a cost of E - 4 / 5
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (now need to get ouf of a grapple to attack me XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause neither of us got sealess or grapple moves atm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) seemed to have succesfully pinned the boy down, her eyes squinting at him.
<font color = white>&#34;You already know jutsus it seems. Was it a Ninjutsu?&#34;</font>
There was a hint of envy, but mostly curiousity, in her tone.

Hanamura rolled off of her opponent before getting back up.
Were he to continue the fight, she wouldn&#39;t mind going further.
But if it were ended, then and there, she&#39;d be fine with it too.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..ninjutsu
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I know the basics of the academy
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Wow... Amazing. It seems I did miss a few classes and lessons, then...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: not really
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) yells: Well surprise surprise! Nice!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: One person with milky eyes gave it to me
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: The Hyuuga clan head.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Alongside few other scrolls.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) yells: Interesting!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: as you see...im fragile 
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: or well..not quick enough
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) were the fight to be over, which she now assumed it was, she&#39;d hold out a hand to help the boy up.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not fragile, really. Maybe a bit slow, but definitely not fragile.
Training will do us both good.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe if was more faster...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: on the good side..if you did attacked me i would had switched with the fishing rod
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: ... Switched?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm....Thats how Kawarimi works
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You need a object with the size of your torso..then to be hit
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afterwhich you go at the objects place.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I see... Incredible.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If i used more chakra perhaps you would had taken down a fishing rod
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) covered her mouth with her right hand, chuckling softly.
<font color = white>&#34;That would have been surprising and, well, quite funny.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Other than that...there is two other techniques i know
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: One is basic disguise..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And the other? cloning
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The disguise can be seen by any capable ninja,is not something hard to notice,but its good if no one is smart enough
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The clone technique is good aswell
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But..is better if use it as a surprize attack
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I see... I hope to learn more about this, soon, as well.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You will.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you fast like this,i won't be surprized  about your capabilities after learning these jutsus
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Eheheh... Well, I'm not sure if I'd be amazing at it. Speed is one thing, control would be another...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah though its the most basic of basics
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: So your control is fine
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Perhaps... Either way, it was a good spar we had. And I hope our 'craftsman' feels the same way about it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Reminds me...i need whatever i go on my first mission,to spend my money on some kunais
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I got some good eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Oh. That'll come in handy for a medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: You did mention having trained in Shurikenjutsu. I would love to see you use it, sometime.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If i get shurikens that is.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: cause..im pretty sure the academy doesn't allow its students to wield them
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: True...  I suppose we can't, unless we have permission?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Either way, shall we all head back? Who knows, maybe more people have come around and about?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe? we can ask
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And sure..lets get back
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Tenjin, want me to grab you?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (thnx)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (No problem. ^^)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can search around for other people if you guys want to
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, it's no bother really. They will come around when they are ready, I am sure.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Hmm....
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah,hopefully sooner than later
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cccc00>Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) appeared to have begun zoning out once again.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll need to come up with a way to get resources for crafting with...&#34;</font> he uttered.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: What kind of resources would you need?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well..untill you get status of genin...no way you going out of here
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not that is impossible,but its way dangerious for someone uncapable of fighting to enter alone,let alone  mine.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That might be true, but he could ask a higher up for help, in return for a one-time cheaper service, or some sorts.
<br><font color=green>*Tenjin (The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) says: Sure but there has to be another way...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (at this point ima just be a shinobi fr)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (It's still early, don't give up. ^^)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (if going for akihibara doesnt lemme get the crafting perk for free then there is no real diff between crafter and a shinobi who learned how to craft)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i will be the strongest medic XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i mean we can go to akibahara when all of us get genin status
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (cause i was told if we go without being genins or just...atm we gonna be attacked by ecs
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (like the path is dangerious and etc
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (yeah no worries the resources not the problem i was just thinking about the perk cuz its 20 pts)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (So I'll prob be getting it next week if im lucky)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (atm we getting 3 points per day
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I'm sure the admin team can be talked with, if you plan on starting as a crafter and such.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (after this academy arc ends we going with i belive 6-7? 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (Yeah but they have a fair point at the same time. The free spec thing is for specs that cost 4-6 points so it probably wont be allowed to get anything that costs 20) 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (and they probably wont make it cheaper otherwise alot of shinobi will get it)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (True...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (and i think a shinobi life would be more fun anyway so... we'll see how things turn out)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (a support specialist)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (remember is 100% DR)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I don't really know what I should go, really.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (so yeahhh....if die? you die
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (then again..you get full refund so death is not just im becoming weaker
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (im going for shurikenjutsu medic
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (with t2 speed and agility
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tenjin(The scrawny short-haired boy-Kenryuto1) OOCs: (im going blacksmith/medic/fuuin)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I think Nin/Tai for me.)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: imma check real quick if anyone else is awake
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: As i thinked,its just us
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: More will wake up, or walk about outside, soon enough.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: In the meantime...does anyone of you know about the war between the Senju and Hoshigaki?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The..i belive two year war that had happen in the past
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: The one that included the Yuki and Uzumaki as well, I believe?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah that one
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Apparantly Yuki and Hoshigaki are near extinct.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The war between the Ucumaki  allied with Senju,against the Hoshigaki and Yuki clan was huge
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Even though it lasted so little
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Sorry, back!)
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It was, yes... But I am glad it's over. Long over.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Same..hopefully we won't see anymore local wars.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Which reminds me...i haven't seen senju or Uzumaki either at the academy
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Perhaps they get special education?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe? i don't know,but they the most noble clans in our village
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case,im not a noble,so i don't have any idea if we will ever see one of them running around
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, it shouldn't matter much, to me at least.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: And why is that the case?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Sure, the Uzumaki and Senju have founded the village. And yes, they are noble... I respect them all, of course. But, nobility does not compensate towards skills and training. Even a low-class, poor-lifestyle shinobi can rise to great heights. As long as they try.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: So a skill over genetics?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess you might be right.Perhaps if i push myself hard enough..
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Never give up, is what I believe in.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will chuckle at the never give up part.He belived in it,whoever at the same time was unsure if he can never give up,considering he was not a fighter</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Anyway..guess for now i will relax
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That is a good idea...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Also,don't go to the hospital without higher ups permission
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Apparantly there is some..work going on?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh? I see, thank you
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (warper bugged atm for the hospital)
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Hanamura has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Oh,a new comer
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Yeah, morning, morning...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Too early... I want to go back to sleep...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) tilts her head lightly to the side as she hears the boy.
<font color = white>&#34;I can understand that, although I personally would not. But may I ask, why would you prefer to sleep?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) rose a brow, before allowing his shoulder to shrug, and drop to his sides. 
<font color = white>&#34;Why not? Sleep is good. A little nap, here and there... You can&#39;t beat it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Everyone seems to be napping anyway...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hmmm... Well, I think you could always rest by the tree? None should scold you or anything for doing so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Tchhhh... Who's going to scald me? It's like he said, everyone's asleep anyway. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That... is what I said, nobody is going to scold you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) blinked. He slowly nodded his head.
<font color = white>&#34;Yeah... Yeah, I&#39;m. I&#39;m tired. The sun&#39;s too bright....&#34;</font>

Without another word, he moved towards the shade of the tree, one hand rubbing at his eyes as he dropped down onto the ground and hunched over in a seated position.
<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you both awake, anyway? You could be sleeping too.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im normally around this time of the day awake
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: As for her...i guess its the same thing?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) covered her mouth with her hand as she nods.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m awake because I wish to train and learn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) wanders into what should be described as a square of sorts.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey.&#34;</font> He greeted the group already there before moving his hands into his pockets.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckled once more as more and more people came to be around.
<font color = white>&#34;Hello, everyone. Nice to see more people around again.
I wonder, though, if the Hyuuga Clan Head will be around, soon, as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) is found staring at the sky, arms across his chest. The voice of the approaching boy snaps him to attention. <font color = white>&#34;Oh... hey.&#34;</font> 
He then looks to the stranger girl. <font color = white>&#34;Why, is there some sort of special occasion?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: He gives the scrolls.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) shakes her head slowly, yet her smile would not fade.
Instead, her eyes would scan the two recently arrived.

A green-haired individual, and a black-haired one.
The Green-haired one seemed taller, more mature than herself, or even more-so than the other person.

As for the black-haired one, they seemed feminine, at least, to her.
<font color = white>&#34;Nothing too big should be happening, unless the Festival of Water has begun - But I think it has yet to begin... I believe. As for other activities, it would be the academy.&#34;</font>

The girl moved a hand through her hair before continuing.
<font color = white>&#34;Are you both students as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (hanamura,where did you got that profile code?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (A friend. ^^ Why?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i might need it XD)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (wondering if it will prevent that discord annoyance of changing their link every couple of days
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) turned to his side, looking at the green-haired male before looking around some more, noticing the shark-boy as well.
He'd raise his hand in greeting towards them, a light smirk visable, before he'd listen to the girl some more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded his head, taking a bit of time to read the soft spoken person on the bench. He took note of the courteous smile, which caused him to stare for a bit too long, but then he quickly averted his gaze once their gazes met. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (The profile sadly won't accept Discord Pictures, hence why my first playby failed. But it should work with other sites' pictures, I think.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (discord nerfed using images
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (u gotta host external now
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) got up from her seat, taking a position more centered on the group, rather than sticking to one side of it.
<font color = white>&#34;I do assume you&#39;re both students, as well? What about you?&#34;</font> She&#39;d ask, looking over to the Shark-like boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (not only images but mp3 files too 
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mmmm-hm.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well...is nice to finally see more people.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I'm a student, yes. Yuki, Subaru. Pleasure.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...oh,explains your
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Feminine look
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) offered a nod in confirmation towards the lass, shifting his form to avoid a particularly annoying beam of sunlight breaking through the tree-leaves.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Nice to meet you too, Subaru. I am Hanamura.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked around, taking note of everyone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kusahara. Student.&#34;</font> He said briefly, but with a bit more volume in his voice this time so everyone could hear.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well Hanamura,is seems we found out  other students.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That's correct, yes. And I do hope more will come, as well. Even so, I am pleased to see more and more are waking up.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Either way, nice to meet you, as well, Kusahara.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded in response. <font color = white>&#34;And you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) let out a sharp wan, reclining back somewhat, the pale-skinned individual almost threatening to fall back onto the ground from his seated position. 
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, right. Introductions, uh... Hello. I&#39;m Saigosame. Of the Hoshigaki clan. Just, you know, in case there was any doubt.&#34;</font>, he remarked, following with a brief chuckle at his own joke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Might I ask, have either of you decided on a goal or focus, yet? For myself, I like to train in Ninjutsu and Taijutsu. But I am also still open for learning other paths, of course. - And pleasure to meet you, Saigosame, as well.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Nice to meet you all. Good to see a Hoshigaki about, and glad my eyes didn't fool me, heheh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) scratches the back of his head, smirking lightly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank stare to the question stated, looking back up at the sky to find some sort of sign or answer, finding none. In the end he just shrugged, looking at the others and listening to their answers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Ah, sorry, as far your question...
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) yells: I suppose Ninjutsu, yes. Maybe some additions for self-defense in close-combat could be great!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: We have one blacksmith and one future medic besides her
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Cool, well, medics are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah,medics and blacksmiths are more uncommon aswell.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Hm... 
<br><font color=red>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=red>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, if any of you have questions, or need anything, feel free to ask. -- Then again, I'm sure we're all on equal level, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: After what ive seen from you Hanamura? Im unsure,atleast for myself
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) noticably entered a thoughtscape that painted his expression a bit grim, but it faded in a few moments, possibly snapped out of it by Hanamura. <font color = white>&#34;I wonder about that.&#34;</font> He would respond to her assumption. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) clapped his hands together.
<font color = white>&#34;You know what? This place needs a map. It&#39;s like a maze, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I agree.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its fine.Perhaps you guys need to go out more
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It can be confusing, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can easily remember it.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Exploring does help.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Be back soon a moment, sorry.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looks at Saigosame with narrowed lips, and shrugs as if to say <font color = white>&#34;I guess it&#39;s just you and me.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: I could do with some sightseeing later, I suppose.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: But it shouldn't be too difficult to remember everything, heh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) took a glance back at Subaru, and let out a defeated sigh. Now as forever, the Yuki and the Hoshigaki were united.
<font color = white>&#34;Man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) noticed the Hoshigaki&#39;s glance, making him blink a couple times.
<font color = white>&#34;Something wrong?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (oh, i'm cooked, that was meant for kusahara. my bad. i misread the chat.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (No worries. xD)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Huh? No. I mistook you for Kusahara. Listen- I'm REALLY tired.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) closed his eyes and took a deep whiff of the chill dusk air. 
<font color = white>&#34;Getting late.&#34;</font> He muttered to himself. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) eyes Kusahara and then looks down his own form.
<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we do look similar.&#34;</font> He&#39;d jest before shrugging.
<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, all is fine, really.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Heh.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: More like getting early if you ask me, though.
<br><font color=red>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (god, this 3 pp is vile... 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (BRB)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like boy-Dilithium) OOCs: (i missed wipe start last time i played srp so i was getting catchup and shit, but this.....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Early, late... It's all good time for sleeping.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Sounds like you'll need a pillow on your desk at the Academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) said with a slight smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I guess everyone is traning?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If I sleep through the lessons I'll end up super-behind.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or you guys just study inside the academy only
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I'm not some sort of super-genius... You know?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Im not either,but is good to practice what you have learned.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shrugged once more. <font color = white>&#34;I study on my own, but nothing too serious.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns to acknowledge the newly arrived person.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: I see...then,what do you want to do after the academy ends?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Has...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Has the academy even STARTED yet?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gave a blank look to that question. <font color = white>&#34;What does a bird want to do when it&#39;s no longer a chick? We are Shinobi, most of us here will be fighting and probably dying for the village.&#34;</font> He said plainly. <font color = white>&#34;Hopefully dying later than sooner...&#34;</font> he added in a low tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It did started.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: It will end in a year.
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Hanamura has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And...not everyone is a fighter.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: It is why I said "most of us here."
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: True..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case..hopefully we meet each other thoughout the year and inside the battlefield.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded and tried to shake off the grimness of his words, almost as if they were not his own. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: By the way, did I not catch your name, or...?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yakushi,Najiro
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I am back.)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Future medic.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, sorry, I must have been deep in thought, I see we have another fellow student? Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded. <font color = white>&#34;Ah... so you&#39;ll be trying to keep us among the living.&#34;</font> He said with a soft smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked once again at the child in the kimono, who has not said a word since they arrived.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: More of keeping people who are worthy to live.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But yes,trying to keep people alive.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Noted.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I would say all lifes are worthy, really...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) pulled his sunhat over his eyes, mostly to avoid the glaring light of the streetlamp above him.
<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s a kinda weird way of looking at it, I mean... I think choosing who&#39;s worthy of living, that&#39;s not on us to decide as people.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: I mean, if I had to kill someone? Sure. But it's not because I chose to, it's because their bad choices in life led them to that moment where karma decided they weren't worthy of continuing on, right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its a certain view Hanamura.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I can explain it later..but for now guess i will relax on the bench
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) asks: So the recent genin killings were karma too?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Man... I didn't hear nothing about that, don't quote me on anything.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) looked at Saigosame with some seriousness on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: That's been talked about all over the village...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: ... A-anyways...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I wonder if any of the teachers are going to be around soon. It would be amazing to learn more.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: For real? This is the first I'm hearing about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Anyway- Killing for the SAKE of killing is a sure-fire way to end up in bad karma. So, whoever DID do all that will get theirs soon enough.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) let the topic go, as he didn't want to sour the mood further, but nodded at Saigosame in response. Then, he turned to Hanamura. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hanamura,i will see you later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Think to do the whole..zoning out.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: Are you alright, Najiro?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: im fine.Just gonna do some..napping
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Very well. We'll talk more later, then.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, I guess the Hyuuga have no trouble seeing at night, so they are fine appearing in the dark.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Ughhh... Hello, mister Sun.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Please shine ANYWHERE other than my face, thank you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) cast a lofty gaze on those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) chuckles softly, looking over towards the Hoshigaki again.
<font color = white>&#34;You really are not a morning, or maybe even day person, are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yamaki (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: No such thing as karma...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) shuddered for a moment, as he realized someone was observing them from behind, then turned around slowly.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean. When I get my good and proper eight to twelve hours a day...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Then I'm chipper as can be. Today is not one of those days...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: I'm sorry to hear that. If there's a way I can cheer your day up, I'd be willing to try?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) generalize gaze would slowly hone in on the person seeking eye contact with him.
  <font color = white>&#34;....?&#34;</font> - he tilts his head to the side.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Subaru(The long-haired boy-Aetherose) OOCs: (Back. Freaking cat jumped on my PC's Power Button. xD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) ponders, for a few moments. Eventually, he raises a hand, and points up at the sun.
<font color = white>&#34;Make THAT go away.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) he lifted one hand in a greeting at the newly arrived person. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Kfh, no, I'm kidding. I'm going to head back home and get some actual sleep. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) picked himself up from the ground with a grumble, stretching his arms for a few moments before lumbering over towards the wall to his west. Without a second thought, he steps over the threshhold into the water, and disappears under the current.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) leans his head over ever so slightly in that of a nod.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: He must be -really- tired, huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) took a few more moments to size the fellow student up, then nodded and turned back to the centre of the gathering place.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I suppose so. He was quite tired when he arrived. I suppose he really needs a long nap, then. Which is fine, no classes have begun yet - today at least. As far as I am aware.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Hm? Oh, hey there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) looks from side to side. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay then.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Since there aren't much of any teacher awake or around, should we try to train, like, spar or something?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: ...Oh that's where everyone is.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: And I suppose we could spar, if any of you are interested. Could even make a sort of 'team spar' to see how well we work together. But, do not feel forced to, of course.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns his head back to look at the finely dressed kid, then put up a hand as a greeting.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) muttered something beneath his breath and began advancing forward towards the crowd. Maintaining his silence he'd hope to melt into the group seamlessly as they continued their discussion. However it seemed as though there was about to be a spar between two of the children. 

Closing his distance tween him and the others, the child began assessing the two. Maybe they were the top boys of Amegakure, or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) folds his arms and watches the bout from afar.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets again.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m fine with a spar or anything, really. Team or not. But yeah, I do wish the teachers would wake up and such, heh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm up for it. Would be nice to know what and who I'm working with in the future.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) looked towards the Yuki and the green-haired person before chuckling, covering her mouth as she did.
<font color = white>&#34;Three of us, then... Well, I suppose you two could spar, if you&#39;d like, and I&#39;ll just watch? That is, unless someone would like to join in?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Sure, I'll be up for that. You, Kusahara?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, sounds good.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Well, shal we do it here, or wanna go elsewhere? You got an idea, Hana?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm fine either way, but we don't want to go too far, in case the teacher arrives.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: When I sparred earlier, we went west a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Lead the way, then.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Follow me, hahaha. -- Anyone wanting to watch, feel free to watch along, as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) stretches his arms then follows briskly after the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Here's where I sparred, so, go ahead and face each other.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) settles into a closed fist, narrow fighting stance, gaze locked with his sparring partner.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) smirks as he enters a most simplistic stance.
<font color = white>&#34;Alright, just a spar, no need for any &#39;cool stuff&#39; or, well, serious injuries.
Can&#39;t wait to see how we&#39;ll do, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) smirks as he watces the other student get closer as well.
His own movement slowing down just a bit, only to get closer still.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) slowly advances, his fists in front of his body to deliver quick jabs once he is near enough. Once Yuki is close enough, Kushara would charge, upper body leant forward, ready to deliver quick upward strikes at the jaw of his opponent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) watches the two of them closely, seeing as their speed wasn&#39;t much different than her own speed, the two must have other capabilities that improve them.
Her eyes squint as Subaru would slow down a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what he&#39;s planning...&#34;</font> She&#39;d whisper softly, only to watch Kusahara next.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) draws near, mild curiosity along his visage. As the sparring match of sorts commenses he'd allow his eyes to traces both of the trainers movements.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) didn&#39;t let his smirk fade. Not even in the slightest, as he would weave himself past the uppercut-attempt coming from Kusahara, before aiming a jab of his own at the taller&#39;s stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice try!&#34;</font>

[Agility: E+]
[Dodged: 1/4 ]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) snarls and catches Yuki's fist, using the momentum of his strike to pull him closer, ready to deliver an elbow strike at the back of his head.

[Dodged: 1/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) kept his smirk up even when his own strike did not land.
Nimble movements, at least, for their comparitive levels, would allow him to move around his sparring partner, aiming to reach his side, dodging the attack once more before aiming a strike at their hip.

[Dodged: 2/4]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gasped swiftly at the incoming strike, taking a step back to reposition himself away from the attack and gather his strength.

[Dodged 2/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) didn&#39;t hold back, he&#39;d rush forward, ready to strike again.
His feet would slide over the dirt below, before his elbow would aim its way towards Kusahara&#39;s chest.

<font color = white>&#34;Heh, trying to get away, are we?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) focused his gaze and waited for the Yuki to get closer, before taking a risky gamble, sidestepping just before the attack landed, hoping to deliver a punch to the cheeks and knocking his opponent on the ground.

[Dodged 3/3] </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) would move away just in time, moving his left arm to intercept the upcoming blow, moving it out of the way before his own fist would aim at the center of the other&#39;s stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;Not bad! But I&#39;m not going to take any of your hits if I can prevent them!&#34;</font>

[Dodged again]
[Strength E]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) could not move fast enough to avoid the confident fist stabbing into his stomach! It had enough force to knock the air out of him, and leaving him crumbled on the ground, gasping and coughing.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah.... okay... you win!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) blinked as the blow did it for him.
Subaru would scratch the back of his head, however, before holding a hand out for his sparring partner.
<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t give up so fast, but, uh, yeah... We&#39;ll both get stronger, for sure.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: It seems that went well? Are you both alright? It is a noble thing to see that you don't persist further, Subaru. And don't worry, Kusahara, I'm sure you'll have another chance later on to show how good you are, or how much you've improved then.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) , still clutching his stomach with one hand, allowed the Yuki to help him up from the ground. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah... well I am not sure I&#39;m cut out to be a taijutsu master... sorry to disappoint.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) yells: Hey, now, not disappointed at all!
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Heh, it was fun though.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: And I'm alright, Hanamura. Thanks.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) wiped the saliva off his face. <font color = white>&#34;Hm... it was.&#34;</font> He smiled softly, trying his best to hide it though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) nodded at the young girl, then nursed his aching belly as he aimed to walk back to the monument where they gathered previously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Everyone has left it seems? Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I will have a look around.
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Well, a couple of them were hiding in the trees, observing us.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Ah, yes, I did notice such...
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Not sure if they are still there.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, I shall be back soon.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) Feeling both invigorated and slightly fatigued from the intense handseal training session, Daigen decided to change his approach. He spotted a nearby bench in an open area and made his way towards it, the gentle drizzle of rain now a familiar companion. Sitting down on the bench, he allowed himself a moment to catch his breath and relax his muscles.

The open space around him was peaceful, with the soft sounds of rain providing a calming backdrop. Daigen knew that even while sitting, he could continue practicing his handseals. It was a good way to train his speed and precision without the added strain of standing for long periods.

He took a deep breath and began forming the handseals, starting slowly to ensure each seal was perfect. Snake, Ram, Monkey, Boar, Horse, Tiger. His fingers moved methodically, each seal precise and deliberate. As he grew more comfortable, he increased his speed, challenging himself to maintain accuracy even as his hands moved faster.

The rain seemed to create a serene atmosphere, helping Daigen to focus more intently. He cycled through the seals repeatedly, feeling the familiar rhythm take over. Occasionally, he would close his eyes, relying solely on muscle memory to guide his movements. This practice helped him to internalize the sequences even more deeply.

After several minutes of intense focus, Daigen noticed a slight stiffness in his fingers. He paused, shaking out his hands and flexing his fingers to relieve the tension. Taking a brief moment to stretch, he gazed around the open area, appreciating the tranquility of the moment.

Determined to keep pushing forward, Daigen resumed his handseal practice. This time, he decided to mix up the sequences, incorporating more complex combinations and transitions. He formed seals like Rat, Ox, and Dog, integrating them into fluid sequences with the basic seals he had mastered earlier. The variety kept his mind engaged and his reflexes sharp.

As he practiced, Daigen&#39;s confidence grew. He could feel his fingers moving with increasing speed and accuracy, the hours of training paying off. The occasional misstep still occurred, but he quickly corrected himself, using each mistake as an opportunity to improve.

The rain continued to fall gently, creating a rhythmic sound that seemed to synchronize with his movements. Daigen felt a deep sense of connection to his surroundings, the peaceful environment enhancing his focus and determination.

After a particularly intense sequence, Daigen paused once more, letting out a satisfied breath. He looked at his hands, feeling a sense of pride in the progress he had made. The training had been challenging, but it was clear that his efforts were yielding results.

Deciding to end his session on a positive note, Daigen formed one final sequence of handseals, pushing himself to his maximum speed. His hands moved with blinding speed, each seal flowing seamlessly into the next. The satisfaction of a perfect run filled him with pride and motivation.

As he sat back on the bench, Daigen felt a deep sense of accomplishment. He knew that there was still much to learn and many skills to master, but this training session had brought him one step closer to his goals. The path of a shinobi was never easy, but with each day, he felt himself growing stronger and more capable.

<font color = white>&#34;One step at a time,&#34;</font> he thought to himself, a smile forming on his lips. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll keep pushing forward.&#34;</font>

With renewed determination, Daigen stood up from the bench, ready to continue his journey. The rain had lightened to a gentle mist, and the village around him seemed to glow with a sense of possibility. As he walked through the open area, Daigen felt a deep sense of purpose and resolve. He was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, knowing that each step brought him closer to becoming the shinobi he aspired to be.

He looks up at the soft spoken lass and nods.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello..Hm.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Oh, sorry!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (all good)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) wasn&#39;t sure what had happened prior to meeting the boy, but that didn&#39;t matter at this point.
<font color = white>&#34;Sorry to bother, if I am, but have you seen any teachers around?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) parts his hands while shaking his head.

<font color = white>&#34;No I haven&#39;t. I&#39;m not sure where they would but but I wouldn&#39;t focus on finding them. Weren&#39;t you in the graduation class a few weeks ago?&#34;</font> 

(Apparently everyone is starting as a student that will graduate by the end of the OOC week. We were told to develop our character)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (test)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (I was told we're students thsi week.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (Yeah we're students but we dont take classes)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (Its like we already took our test and we're preparing for graduatio)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Ah, okay.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) nods.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Daigen by the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Sotoru, Daigen
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, it's not so much about taking classes though, more or less-- Well, it matters not. - Pleasure to meet you, Daigen. I am Hanamura. A few of us have situated ourselves near the monument to the south of here, beside the fact I wanted to see a teacher, I also wanted to see if more students were around..
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Oh? The monument? That's where everyone is. Hm. I prefer solitude as of now to be honest. But yes good to meet you Hanamura.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I plan on being one of the strongest shinobi Amegakure has ever seen.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Don't have much time to hang around with everyone.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, there's two sayings I could say here... Really.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (*.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) let out a giggle as she covered her mouth.
<font color = white>&#34;One would be... There&#39;s no I in teamwork. And the other, well, you need people to climb the ladder up, as you&#39;ll also need them when you climb back down.

Of course, I mean no ill offense or anything. Everyone goes about it their own way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) took a moment to consider Hanamura&#39;s words, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. He appreciated her perspective, even if his own approach differed. 

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I appreciate your insight, Hanamura,&#34;</font> Daigen said with a friendly smile. <font color = white>&#34;I am friendly and understand the value of teamwork, but there&#39;s also an &#39;I&#39; in &#39;accountability.&#39; I don&#39;t want to be distracted and shirk on my training.&#34;</font>

He met her gaze, his tone warm and sincere. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s important to me to stay focused and dedicated, especially when I have big goals. But that doesn&#39;t mean I won&#39;t join you all from time to time. Everyone has their own way of climbing the ladder, right?&#34;</font>

Daigen&#39;s smile widened as he added, <font color = white>&#34;No offense taken. I respect your approach, and it&#39;s good to hear different perspectives. Maybe I&#39;ll see you and the others at the monument sometime. For now, I&#39;ve got to keep pushing myself.&#34;</font>

With that, he nodded respectfully to Hanamura, his determination evident but tempered by a genuine friendliness.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) listened to the boy&#39;s words carefully, equally smiling in return.
<font color = white>&#34;Of course, everyone does go their own paths, and each - as you said - climbs the ladder their own way, or even their own type of ladders.&#34;</font>

The girl would bow, deeply, showing formality.
<font color = white>&#34;I will let you return to your training, but I would at least offer this.
If ever you need aid or help in training, even a training partner, I&#39;d be more than happy to give it a go.&#34;</font>

She then turned around, ready to make her leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) nods.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll hold you to those words Hanamura. Thank you for your concern. It means alot.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: No problem! See you again, sometime. Daigen.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) waves.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s frustration simmered as he redirected his focus to the dark-skinned dancer, recognizing her as the only person who seemed truly present among the indifferent crowd. In his eyes, the others were mere zombies or filler, lacking the vitality he sought.

<font color = white>&#34;We can fight as long as no damages? Hmm.&#34;</font> Sogeki smirked, his tone challenging and provocative. <font color = white>&#34;No promises!&#34;</font>

He stepped forward with purpose, intending to intercept her departure and assert his presence, though not necessarily dominance.

<font color = white>&#34;G&#39;day,&#34;</font> he greeted, the aggression in his voice tempered with a hint of restraint. It was clear Sogeki possessed some degree of manners, even in his confrontational approach. His demeanor conveyed authority, yet there was a nuanced respect in his interaction with her, acknowledging her as a potential challenger rather than dismissing her outright.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Seems more people are here, right now... Odd, I thought the Monument-area would have been a more crowded area.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked, she had begun walking away to begin her joyous and rather calming walk amongst the village she lived within. A softly jingle of coin could be noted, a section of coins locked upon silk-threads were placed at her hip. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? Good day,&#34;</font>

She replied in a rather simple, blunt and cold method. Her head slowly turned to face him, and those hands fastened behind her back promptly. 

   <font color = white>&#34;All damages inflicted to the village will be inflicted to you,&#34;</font>

She reaffirmed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) takes his pinky out of his ear and wipes the wax off the tip of it on the wall nearby.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) thinks: I wonder if something happened?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Welp.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (Welp*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s gaze narrowed slightly as he observed the dark-skinned dancer&#39;s demeanor, noting the jingle of coins at her hip and the poised stance she held. Her blunt and cold reply didn&#39;t faze him; if anything, it piqued his interest further.

<font color = white>&#34;All damages inflicted to the village will be inflicted to you,&#34;</font> she asserted firmly.

Sogeki&#39;s smirk deepened as he unfolded his arms and casually scanned her attire, assessing her as a shinobi based on what he could discern. Her silk-threaded coins hinted at a blend of agility and resourcefulness, likely indicating proficiency in movement-based techniques.

With a nonchalant shrug, Sogeki met her gaze evenly. <font color = white>&#34;How about this,&#34;</font> he began, his tone carrying a hint of challenge. <font color = white>&#34;You become my direct mentor. I&#39;m sure you have plenty to teach me.&#34;</font> His demand was bold and direct, reflecting his confidence and disregard for the consequences she warned of.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) walks to the group of civilians while sipping on her iced coffee.A loud slurping noise can be heard as the girl reached the bottom of her drink.

<font color = white>&#34;That was good,I can finally start my day.&#34;</font>she said while shaking her bottle causing the ice to bang on the inside of the bottle<font color = white>&#34;So how is everyone today?I hope all is good or are we just standing here waiting for something to happen?&#34;</font>

The girl seemed a bit snarky as if she was some type of mean girl or something.Her eyes would size everyone up and down before casting judgment on their fit.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh hello,how&#39;s it going miss?&#34;</font>she said while waving at the darkskin lady<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re never hard to find.....if we were in a book you&#39;d be considered a main character based off how you stick out.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked. Her attention drawn for the moment, and slowly she smirked. 

   <font color = white>&#34;My mentorship requires one to earn it,&#34;</font>

She slowly moved towards this young man, the one that held the mettle of being the Grandson of a Hero. Those subtle steps were nearly silent, each step slow, and focused - if he didn&#39;t flee?

He would only know truly understand what she had planned to do. A hand extended, and if she wasn&#39;t stopped? She would rather easily motion to fling that man up and into the air. 

A rather jolting motion, and the direct was towards the nearby lake. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? A main character? I suppose my attire is noticable,&#34;</font>

She moved to return to her spot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would nod her head even though she was more so talking about her skin color compared to all the pale skinned people around her who seemed to hate the sun rays</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: More people.

<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: Hey guys, what's up?
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Oh, uh, not much on my end. Was wondering where most people were.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Looks they're all here.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Well, some are, or were, at the monument.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Mm... Cool.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I did see a couple people on my way here.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would remove her gloves and begin to moisturize her hand<font color = white>&#34;Cant be caught looking.....&#34;</font>she would eye one of the males who appeared to look poor.Once she was done she would reach into her bag and pull out some perfume causing the unassuming boy to be in her perfume range.


<font color = white>&#34;Nice and fresh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) narrows his eyes on Sogeki and the dancer from afar. He hadn't taken him for the type to ask for mentorship. In what he'd briefly seen of him he seemed closer to a brute of some kind. His head slowly tilts to the side as his eyes trail along the woman's movements.

In one swift motion she watches the woman attempt to throw them into the waters and in this he looks toward the newcomer on his right.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) looked over towards the girl with an enchanted aura. He smelled the perfume but did not really think much of it.

<font color = white>&#34;So... What&#39;s the haps?&#34;</font>

He would say, shoving his hands in his pockets and swinging back and forth on his feet.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would turn around and saw a boy standing behind her.As she took a look at him she would get scared a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh my gosh......You scared me.....&#34;</font>she would notice the male&#39;s hair causing her to have a disgusted expression on her face<font color = white>&#34;Sooo.....you like need some food or something?&#34;</font>she said to him thinking he was homeless or something.

<font color = white>&#34;Here you can have my pork bun.....I&#39;m sorry this happened to you.&#34;</font>a smile would appear on her face she managed to help someone in need.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) didn&#39;t notice anyone walking up to him. He was chilling and minding his own business. Suddenly his head rocketed back and <font color = white>&#34;ACHOO!&#34;</font> he sneezed.

Blinking a few times he noticed he was mid air. Spiraling about like a ball thrown in the air. Not a single clue as to how he even got up here. <font color = white>&#34;Sheesh. Must of been a strong sneeze-&#34;</font> and then he splashed right in to the river. Nothing happened after that. Just bubbles surfacing to the top.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Wait wait wait... What...?&#34;</font>

He would raise his hands up and push away anything she would try to offer him.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you think I&#39;m a begger...?&#34;</font>

He looked himself over for a minute, he looked fine as far as he saw, his hair was just a bit messy, not dirty.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhm... This doesn&#39;t look good...?&#34;</font> She&#39;d say, not quite loud, but not in a hushed tone either, before rushing towards the water, herself, jumping in, in order to try and help the boy out of it, or at least get him to not stay underwater.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s focus remained unwavering amidst the chaos that often swirled around him. While his classmates indulged in various extracurricular activities, he remained singularly dedicated to forging a path towards a stronger future. The petty distractions of others held no sway over his ambitions or principles.

His determination to establish a solid foundation for himself was palpable, driving him to hone his skills relentlessly. Whether in combat training or mastering advanced techniques, Sogeki pushed himself with unwavering discipline. The fleeting pursuits and diversions of his peers were inconsequential in his pursuit of mastery and excellence.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me,&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the ambient noise, his tone laced with arrogance and confidence as he turned to the dark-skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;How does one earn the honor of becoming your first and most important pupil?&#34;</font> His gaze locked onto hers, challenging and expectant, as if daring her to recognize his potential and skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) rubs the nape of his neck and looks off over to the comotion to his left. His posture was one of faint exhuasion.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) would narrow his eyes at her once again, getting more and more confused by the second.

<font color = white>&#34;N-no... It&#39;s just my hairstyle and I like it... I don&#39;t need a haircut.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d proceed to raise his hands up to cover his head and protect his hair from the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Mugen, Yurei (The long-haired boy-Mirageman) kept his hands to his side and then looked over with a light smile to those of his right. His long tied hair swayed in the soft undiffused evening breeze.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: There is nothing honorable about becoming someone's pupil, lowborn.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had returned to her place, and stood there once more with her hands nestled behind her back. A poised stance, one of experience past her years, and it honestly showed. 

She didn&#39;t even make notice of the young lad drowning - he would learn to swim, or he would sink. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? My methods are harsh, brutal, and often end the lives of those wishing to learn to become like me if they survive? Often more then not they are crippled. Train, and show me that you can survive - then we can see,&#34;</font>

She answered simply.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) When the soft spoken lass leaped in to the water, they&#39;d see the white-haired boy with his legs and arms crossed relaxing in the water. As if taking a break before decided to resurface.

A wave given and then <font color = white>&#34;..hllphb.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say as air bubbles escaped his mouth when speaking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do not baby Genin, I am not here to coddle you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) 
As Daigen left the tranquil training area and walked towards the busier parts of Amegakure, he soon found himself in a crowded marketplace. The vibrant energy of the village was palpable, with merchants calling out their wares, villagers chatting animatedly, and children running about. The contrast to the solitude of his training ground was stark, but Daigen moved through the crowd with ease, his senses alert and focused.

His attention was drawn to a dark-skinned woman standing in the center of the bustling crowd. She had an air of confidence and charisma that seemed to captivate those around her. The crowd’s attention was firmly fixed on her, and she spoke with a commanding presence that demanded respect.

Daigen didn't approach her directly. Instead, he found a spot nearby where he could observe without drawing too much attention to himself. Leaning against a wall, he watched as the woman engaged with the people around her. She spoke passionately about something, her gestures animated and expressive. 

He tried to discern what she was saying from a distance. Her voice, though clear, was drowned out by the general noise of the market. However, her body language and the reactions of the crowd spoke volumes. She appeared to be a figure of some importance or influence, and the villagers seemed to hang on her every word.

Daigen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he observed. He noted the way she commanded the space around her, the way people leaned in to listen, the respect evident in their expressions. There was something about her that intrigued him, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. 

His thoughts wandered as he considered the possibilities. Who was this woman? What role did she play in the village? Was she a shinobi, a leader, or perhaps someone with a different kind of influence? 

For now, Daigen chose to remain an observer. He knew that understanding the people around him, especially those who commanded such attention, could be crucial. He continued to watch, taking in every detail, from her expressions to her interactions with the crowd.

Though he didn’t make a move to approach her, Daigen stored away this moment in his mind. One day, it might prove useful to know more about the influential figures within his village. For now, he would remain in the background, learning what he could from the shadows.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) shook his head silently as he turned toward the ongoing conversation between who he'd assumed to be the instructor and his peers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Then again.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) blinked again slolwy, at this point he was beginning to get self conscious about his hair, was it really that bad?

<font color = white>&#34;No... I love my family. What&#39;s wrong with my hair? I think it looks cool, I go out every day looking like this.&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t know how to deal with this, he had never experienced this sort of interaction before.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) gave the white-haired boy a dumbfounded look, before pouting as she&#39;d fold her arms.
The boy was likely a Hozuki, Shinobi of Water.
<font color = white>&#34;Well crud...&#34;</font> She&#39;d think, seeing how her help wasn&#39;t even neccessary.

Then, the realization set in further, and she couldn&#39;t help but smile at the boy, waving back at him before pointing up, as she decides it was best to leave the boy in his &#39;area of expertise&#39;, and to have some fresh air, herself, climbing out of the water, soaking wet, afterwards.</font></font></font>

He noticed the way she spoke and took notes, understanding her building a strong rapport with each individual.
The boy picked up on a few key details, noticing how the woman often spoke about improvements and benefits for the village. It became cleaer that she was a local leader.
Satisfied with the information he had gathered, Daigen leaned back against a railing and took a deep breath while analyzing and channeling the information he had received.

<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I haven't, personally, seen her before. At least, I'm not quite sure. To me though she may seem like an entertainer of sorts - However, she did fling a person into the water. This likely would mean she's either a higher-ranked Shinobi - Or kunoichi, or she's just very strong as well as, well, you get the point, probably...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s gaze sharpened with a flicker of anger that simmered beneath his confident exterior, fueling his desire to surpass not only others but himself as well. The dark-skinned dancer&#39;s blunt assessment of her training methods, harsh and unforgiving, resonated with him on a primal level.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm,&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted, his voice edged with the simmering anger that churned within him. He acknowledged the truth in her words, knowing that talent alone would not suffice in the brutal world of shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;Harsh, brutal, and often crippling,&#34;</font> he repeated, his tone now laced with a fierce determination rather than excitement. <font color = white>&#34;I understand.&#34;</font>

His eyes bore into hers with a steely resolve. <font color = white>&#34;I have talent, but I know I must work harder than anyone else to get ahead and stay ahead,&#34;</font> he declared firmly. The acknowledgment of his own potential was coupled with a relentless drive to prove himself worthy of her instruction, to push beyond his limits and emerge stronger, regardless of the challenges ahead.

<font color = white>&#34;I accept your terms,&#34;</font> Sogeki affirmed, his voice ringing with the conviction born of both anger and ambition. <font color = white>&#34;Train me. I&#39;ll show you what I&#39;m capable of.&#34;</font> His declaration hung in the air, a silent vow to himself and a challenge to the dancer who had dared him to prove himself worthy. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: And... Seeing as someone practically begs her to train them, she's likely Chuunin or higher?
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ..what did that scrub just say..!? Begging? Tch.. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) continued to stand her ground; her hands never unfurling or leaving her back while she listened. She sighed briefly, and slowly motioned to ease a hand from the curling behind her back. 

She rubbed her chin slowly; her skin untouched - almost flawless in nature despite her information regarding her training regiment. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Earn it, over the next few weeks I&#39;ll be watching all of you - and I have plans to...educate you all in some manner or another. I have various little tests set up for all of you to curve the impending death many of you will walk into,&#34;</font>

She chuckled slowly. Her hand eased back, and curled back within the other once more. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t die or get killed, we can talk after that,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: My name is Torizuka, Botan.

<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers: Yo. Whats going on with all the people here?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) Daigen nodded intently as the woman spoke about the village leader&#39;s strength and her emphasis on Taijutsu. His eyes flickered back to the incident by the water, confirming the impressive display of power. Taijutsu seemed like a practical choice for someone aspiring to be a strong shinobi.

Turning to Hanamura, he appreciated her insights and wanted to learn more about her specialization.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your specialty, Hanamura?&#34;</font> Daigen asked, curious about her skills and experiences.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Did I miss something?
<br><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) whispers: Oh? Nothing. That woman is just a leader of the village.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) turned her head to face Daigen a moment, before looking back towards Botan.
<font color = white>&#34;I doubt she is an actual leader, a high-ranked official perhaps. But I do not think she&#39;s a leader. No offense.&#34;</font>

She then lowers her head.
<font color = white>&#34;As for my specialty? I&#39;m a student. I have ... Ideas... And dreams and goals, but currently I need practice. Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, I suppose, if that&#39;s an &#39;OK&#39; answer?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) continued to stare forward as Sogeki&#39;s resolve seemed to flicker alight under the harsh layout of the higher-up&#39;s training methods. With each time the boy opened his mouth he seemed to break the otherwise hard exterior his present in hopes of being able to receive direct tutillage from the woman.

 <i><font color = white>&#34;?&#34;</font></i> - His expression was one that questioned why? Or at least, that&#39;s one would&#39;ve been right to assume from it.

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A Leader? No, I'm a Chuunin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) gaze shifted to the older dark-skinned woman with a raised brow, not having expected the village to be led by a woman.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers: Huh imagine that.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) nods.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand. Ninjutsu and Taijutsu are great aspirations.&#34;</font>

He turns to Botan.

His eyes wouldn&#39;t drift at the sound of a mature voice off to the side, however he did note that the word <font color = white>&#34;Chuunin&#34;</font> had been mentioned. 

Surely in time he&#39;d cross path wirth the chuunin one way or another. As for now his thoughts were occupied with the conversation occuring south of his present position.

<font color = white>&#34;Master Matsu mentioned her once as well, so-- Eh?? Why would we damage our own home?&#34;</font> She sneered from behind the pillar.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) was still drenched, that combined with her previous help-attempted being unnecessary, did dampen her mood a bit.
But she&#39;d smile again, even as the lady Botan seemed to be &#39;frightening&#39; in a sense.

<font color = white>&#34;It was an honor and pleasure meeting you, though, lady Botan. I apologise for not knowing too much about you, if anything at all, before seeing you here.&#34;</font>

The girl shook her head before making a few steps sotuhwards.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d better get changed into dry clothing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded. 

   <font color = white>&#34;People often don&#39;t take care of the things that take care of them,&#34;</font>

She replied to the pearl-lass, then she turned towards Hanamura and nodded before she began to speak once more. 

   <font color = white>&#34;No need for apologizes,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked.

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm?,&#34;</font>

She stared at him for the moment; and just continued to stare at him for a good few seconds before she even considered speaking. 

   <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t have any Kunai, no - I would speak to the others which I am sure happen to be around here somewhere,&#34;</font>

She shrugged. 

   <font color = white>&#34;And the uniforms? I really have no knowledge on, again I&#39;d ask the others - I tend to avoid the paperwork,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
