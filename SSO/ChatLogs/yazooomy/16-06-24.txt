After all, she&#39;s known best for a while by now, it would just be in bad faith to keep his thoughts to his own.

<font color = white>&#34;....Huigui muqin de linghun yexu shi keneng de maamaa?&#34;</font> His words were a knife, not helping by the overbearing and visceral tone which surfaces as Meixun&#39;s neutral state.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Awkward...&#34;</font> Her hand retreats!

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah....&#34;</font> The rejection did not happen if she did not adknowledge it!

Kohana nods respectfully to both, her movements precise and controlled. She introduces herself with the utmost grace, a testament to the strict discipline she has endured from her own mother. However, again not as bad as it seems this Uchiha&#39;s mother treats her own.
<font color = white>&#34;A&#39;lass I am not of noble blood as you both. I am Hoshino, Kohana.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
