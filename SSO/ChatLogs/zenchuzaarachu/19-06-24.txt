<font color = white>&#34;il take a few steps back...watch closely...&#34;</font>

She would say as she moved backwards..and began to speak..a hand rose up to be placed infront of her mouth. It opened and the placed her thumb on it and began to blow.

<font color = white>&#34;gumo gumo!!!!&#34;</font>

She began to suddenly expand into a circular ball.

<font color = white>&#34;Balloon!&#34;</font>

She began to roll around in a circular motion aiming to lap her peers...and detroying the earth at their feet. However after a few moments she stopped....being envoloped in a cloud of smoke..and falling down from the air..once it cleared.

Upon landing on her feet..she continued her lecture. <font color = white>&#34;This is the human boulder technique...mostly using our calories as well...it allows us to expand our torso to become a ball so we can roll on our enemies. We can also use this while expanded..in which uses a higher level of calorie control...which is more for a chunins use case&#34;</font>

She paused before continueing once more. 

<font color = white>&#34;theres also the spiked meat ball version of this technique..however your control over your calorie drain must be immaculate or you just end up hurting yourself in the process. For the exact reason..il let you one when its time mhm&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;this here is our trade mark move...and mhm...called the multi-size expansion....our attack range is increased...and...we are a bit slower..in attacking...and in our speed...not that it matters to muc in the long run mhm&#34;</font>

She paused for a moment. 

<font color = white>&#34;a-ah...no fancy call out this time..sorry about that..&#34;</font>

She looks up and thinks of the possibilities. <font color = white>&#34;Using all these calories will make us pretty small thought. Like we will lose all of our stored fat if we sustain them.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: oo impressive...Gear secondo..not bat at all mhm...and yep..its why we eat so much..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: But what id we drain to many calories... we wound be able to use our techniques right?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: but that brings me to our last technique which is our clans form of taijutsu...called Harite...meaning sumo wresting...its why i practice the a subset  of it called judo when making attacks torwards oppoenents.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would step even further back before lowering to the ground..and pressing on it...visable markings slowly began to appear on her form..as she yelled..

<font color = white>&#34;h-ha!!!!&#34;</font>

suddenly the earth in the surrounding area began to shake...and suddenly...began to crack..as chakra began to be visably seen form her figure..taking the form of a golden yellow hue.

<i>CRACKLE crack!</i>

 However suddenly..it slowly began to go away..before she destoryed the place her clan trained in...Her chakra began to die down..becoming less visable and the markings that appeared began to fade away. 

<font color = white>&#34;if i didnt stop early..the ground would of been caved in...runeing our courtyard is a no go...on another note....this is called choharite....i dont think i need to explain what it does..no?&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well we don't have any cool jutsu to train and weapons are super expensive...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I am so close to getting a katana...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: How much more do you need?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Flame in the eyes, determination, etcetera. Not actual flames. No... you youngsters with elemental ninjutsu would be troublesome.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just three-hundred left.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: C'mere Fubuki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked up to Hideo. <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (also i gotta run an errand and will brb for 15 mins)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) reaches into his pocket and produces a very crumpled wad of, what was probably, three-hundred ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Here, get a super cool sword.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at the wad of money and immediately shaked her head while waving her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;No, you don&#39;t need to do it really! I appeciate it but like, it&#39;s a lot.&#34;</font> Fubuki spoke quickly due to being flustered, it was an unexpectedly cool moment from Hideo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and gestures with the money again,

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, spending money makes me happy.&#34;</font>

Lowering the money slightly he smiles. How blessed was he that getting money was his primary goal solely because spending it made him happier... He, however, does not miss an opportunity to be slightly snide,

<font color = white>&#34;Even though you&#39;re sometimes mean and lame. You <i>do</i> need a sword so you can actually fight and stuff. All I need is my dad to stop being lazy and teach me jutsu.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i feel rly bad bc i gotta afk even if only for a bit right after this so i dont wanna seem ungrateful ooc)

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Aw, Hideo's being noble.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm always noble!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched her head while thinking about it, she couldn&#39;t even jokingly bully him. So many people had already helped her and she couldn&#39;t help people back. Eventually she caved in and sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay fine. I accept it if you insist. But for my next katana I&#39;ll try to make the money on my own -- and if you need ANY help, you ask me. You got that?&#34;</font>

She stepped forward and put her hands on her hips, looking at him seemingly upset though her face betrayed her intentions, which were just being serious about her promise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (GRAHHH)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) nods his head and hands her the money, <font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;m immediately calling in my favor; be less mean to me.&#34;</font>

With that handled, he spins to face the old man. Using his still out-stretched hand, now freed of money, to point at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I totally heard you say us having elemental jutsu would be &#39;troublesome&#39;! I&#39;m gonna learn to throw fireballs <b>and</b> mountains and it&#39;ll be the complete opposite of troublesome! It&#39;ll be... helpful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately nodded and grabbed the money, putting it alongside her stash. Just enough for the katana she had ordered.

<font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;ll only be mean if you&#39;re mean to me though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Damn, I guess that's fair.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I appreciate the donation but I won't become a punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have my word I won't start shit though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I would never treat you like one! I'm usually the punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Heh, true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Trust me man I may laugh and smile but it tooootallly sucks most of the time.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If it makes you feel better, I was always joking. Sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, I figured. Thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think Tsuneko may be the only one that actually means it... I 'unno.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nah, she's messing with you too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I don't think anyone actually hates anyone else here.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hrm, I hope so.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) rested his good eye on Hideo while the other glances at Fubuki. He&#39;d let out a troubled sigh as he thought about his days of fighting against ninjutsu.

<font color = white>&#34;Helpful how?&#34;</font>, he questioned as he removed a glass from his sleeve and quickly took a sip.

<font color = white>&#34;You youngsters are something else.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I 'unno I figure throwing mountains could probably help someone somehow. Lemmie get there first. I'll worry about what I do when I'm there, when I'm there!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, very true.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw the man look at them each with a separate eye and couldn&#39;t get that mental image out of her mind. It just might be more traumatizing than yesterday.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, what would be helpful then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Maybe someone will ask me to relocate a mountain range or something heroic like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like, literally carving a path through the mountains or something. That'd probably be super helpful.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Took much plate shifting with cause an earthquake.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'll make the earth stop moving, easy.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: . . .
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hey, I'd be the one carving through the mountains with my sword.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Swords.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fair. But I bet I could just like... rip chunks out of the mountain super easy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Carve a valley with my barehands...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like diggin' through sand at the beach...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) asks: My idea of being helpful is selfish. I would make sure I'd use ninjutsu to protect the crops and livestock! How could I sleep with a full stomach if there's no food?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah but that's like- obvious stuff! I thought wanted unique examples or something!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm a simple man.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: My way of being helpful will be cutting down anyone who attacks us.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Chase off bandits and wolves or whatever with fire?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: Now you're follow the Tooki legacy!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) had a delusional smile on his face as he remembered the cheers of the crowds that gathered around him.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Mm, the small stuff is usually glanced over until those things are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh I guess that's true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I guess all the small stuff would probably be good training too right?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Damn right, if you're going to reach your -goal- then you're gonna have to leave no stone unturned.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think it might be literal stones when it comes to doton training.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, I see what you did there.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Say, Old Man Tooki, what kinds of stuff did you do when you were 'cleaning up the streets'?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was full of energy and brimming with taijutsu mastery.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was gaining experience left and right, finishing fights fast.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) swiftly sent two strikes Eastward. Loud pops from joints, muffled by cloth, bounced from off the mountains.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had only the vaguest understanding of taijutsu basics, if even that. So just seeing two punches performed was enough to convince him.

<font color = white>&#34;A whole ten of us?! Are you sure? Some of us are actually scary strong. Like Katora or Yurei. Buuuuut barring them damn you probably could&#39;ve!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Woah, he actually does know stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: What a time it was to be alive... I think out of fifty, there's only been two farms that were too much to save.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Whoa really? What happened to them?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Too much ninjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) yells: I was completely outclassed!

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I need ninjutsu...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: At that point, I think I reached the peak of taijutsu. Swiftness helped me avoid certain things to close in.
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Akimichi, Koume has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wonder how fast I have to throw a mountain for someone to be unable to just... avoid it with swiftness...
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Depends on the person.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) smirked and left the stick in the hole, as a warning incase someone tried peeking again. Hearing the boy collapse to the floor confirmed her suspicions.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp, I&#39;m gettin&#39; in tha&#39; water.&#34;</font> the teen said. She decided to change inside, though. Folding her kimono and putting it away before returning in a towel.

The girl took a dip into the water, swimming around freely.

<font color = white>&#34;So who else is lookin&#39; forward to becomin&#39; a Genin?&#34;</font> she inquired.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) used her free hand to move one of her raven locks behind her ear before commenting.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) laid against the back as she avoided getting into the water, she felt too old compared to anyone else to do it.

<font color = white>&#34;I wanna a lot. That&#39;s like, one of my goals One of my uhh...five goals. Damn I have too many goals..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: one day..il become a genin..

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) says: Becoming a Jonin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But first you gotta be a Chunnin.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Pfft.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) says: Anyone can become Genin or Chuunin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I think you're underrating those ranks a lot.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) shrugs, and turns a page. <font color = white>&#34;I never said they weren&#39;t important. They&#39;re just not an accomplishment.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would lightly take off her boots..and long socks..as she rested them besides herself. She found herself sitting down and crossing her legs enjoying the waters warmth.

Reaching into her kimono, she slowly took out a clipboard..as she listened to the genin talk. Filling out more information about the lore of herbs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: S'all tha' same, though.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up to the Uchiha, monotone ever-present as he spoke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I think we are both smarter.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) couldn&#39;t help but snicker at his remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Well that&#39;s one thing ya&#39; got in common. Can&#39;t fight ya&#39; on that.&#34;</font> she continued swimming about. <font color = white>&#34;But your personalities too. Both of ya&#39; talk in that same dull tone. Not much fer&#39; words and got an answer for anythin&#39;!&#34;</font> she said which was followed by more laughter.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) began to think once again, a dull matte finish overtaking his once glossy pupils.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up again.
  <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) flipped another page. <font color = white>&#34;And you talk a lot for someone who has nothing to say.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) thought about filling her mouth with water to spit out but when she realized this was a very public body of water she decided against it. Instead she wished she was in a river or ocean or something that flowed.

After hearing Ume speak she turned her gaze towards her. <font color = white>&#34;Heh, I got lots ta&#39; say. Ain&#39;t you been listenin&#39;? Juss&#39; from this conversation I met you an&#39; Bookworm #2. Learned about yer&#39; personalities and...&#34;</font> she paused, swimming a bit closer to the edge.

<font color = white>&#34;I decided. I like Raku more. He&#39;s a know-it-all but he&#39;s not as stuck-up.&#34;</font> she said with a wide grin. She knew Ume wouldn&#39;t care anyhow.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) nodded, and turned her page.

A newfound sense of distance formed between the hot springs, a place often overlooked but particularly busy today. It didn&#39;t matter to the quiet, frail boy.

He removed silky fabrics before walking out to the male area with a towel and shorts on. The reticent young boy slipped into the water, placing a palm onto the sand used for decoration. He would start practicing imbuing it with his Chakra.

After accomplishing that, he would shift it around without weaving a single seal.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) turns to the old merchant.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) peers over his shoulder at the aloof aspirant for just a moment as if he were pinged.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) gestures to Asuno.

<font color = white>&#34;This young talent wanted to meet the head of your military for a business proposal.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) casually sat down in the chair after leading the group into the manor. A tired expression clearly present on her face.. Someday she&#39;d get her tea shipment.. Someday.

Looking up towards the group, she&#39;d listen along quietly as they introduced themselves and what they offered. Subtle nods are given in response as they speak.
 <font color = white>&#34;Greetings, Jungi, and Yuu.&#34;</font>, she&#39;d state with a more pleasant tone than her expression would suggest. <font color = white>&#34;I am Kitsumi of the Shingen clan.&#34;</font>

Giving a pause for Mugen to introduce himself, she continues on.
 <font color = white>&#34;Have you come today specifically to take orders from our aspiring Genin? Or is there something else as well?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would more so remain silent during this talk...seeming more serious than she usually was...similar to a few days ago..if one might recall..mm They stared on with a blank expression...while...

Just taking mental notes, she acted a fool for the students while they were around..but...probably not for important discussions like this...mm</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) glances to the side, his eyes falling on the duo, inviting them to speak their name. They seemed to be a pair, however he could not be certain.

His attention then given to the two men standing before them, nodding as they each introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Mugen, of the Utsuwa Clan and Iwagkaure Jounin.&#34;</font>,he said leaning onto his staff slightly, exuding and aura of confidence and stalwart strength.

<font color = white>&#34;Head of millitary affairs would be me and my compatriot, Kitsu&#39; &#34;</font>,he grinned.

<font color = white>&#34;You havent come to declare war on us now&#34;</font>?,he laughed to himself.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m joking...please tell us your proposal our crafters are not half as renowned as Akihbara&#39;s, we are all ears.&#34;</font>,he folded his arms awaiting their answer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) was calmly gazing at the back of the old man's head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) was drinking water until he almost spit&#39;s it out. He was a samurai in training. He was not ready for the smoke.<font color = white>&#34;Guh good one.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) uses Soichiro&#39;s shoulder for leverage and stands.
           <font color = white>&#34;Hi,&#34;</font> she says, chiming in where Junji left off.
<font color = white>&#34;...my name is Asuno, and I would like to play a tune for you all. I am thankful for your time here today.&#34;</font>

The youth retrieves the flute from her side and carefully inspects the golden pipe, a routine developed over time.
                      <font color = white>&#34;...this performance is called, &#39;Thank You For Your Attention.&#34;</font> 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=be1jJCH32OU] 

With a calm expression, the musician closes her eyes and places her soft lips upon the flute. As she exhales, a melody dances from the instrument, filling the room with light, metaphorical music notes. <font color = white>&#34;~..~...!&#34;</font>

The music stopped, and the girl bowed.
                <font color = white>&#34;I am here today to expand my art portfolio..&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I would love to sell my art dolls to the world but without proper models and influential figures, the brand will be unknown and a failure. No one will want a no-named doll in their collection.. and so I come here today, to meet the most popular and most influnetial shinobi in the land in order to craft a doll in their image.&#34;</font>

The blonde pulls out a doll, made from a Amegakure student. <font color = white>&#34;Here is an example.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (drop ur rp first old head
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) grunts after the musical performance, <font color = white>&#34;Well...ain&#39;t that something!&#34;</font> He her a head nod, 

<font color = white>&#34;Back to the topic at hand, &#34;</font> You&#39;ll find that we&#39;re all able to make weapons and armor but each of us is unique in our own way, thus we might all have a diffrent proposal for you to think over, still, even though we might have an individual purpose, the over-arching goal is the same, to secure an agreement between your villiage and Akihabara!&#34;</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) smiles, the music resonating with him, as his head swayed the tune easing any tension left in the room carrying it away with the melody. Mugen placed a hand on his chin as he continued to enjoy the proformance.

<font color = white>&#34;Bravo..thank you miss Asuno&#34;</font>,the jounin said giving a small round of applause, his head tilting to the side as she expained her reason for coming to iwagakure.

His smile which had already been plastered on his face, grew to stretch from <b>ear to ear.</b>

<font color = white>&#34;Ha&#34;</font>!,he exclaimed as he slammed his fist into the desk, the sound of the collision echoing through the large room.

<font color = white>&#34;My daughter wanted a doll of me, i was scrambling my brain thinking of how i would get her one, you lady Asuno are a life saver&#34;</font>!,the jounin declared, before clearing his throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahem- yes sorry...back to the topic as hand indeed.&#34;</font>,his full attention back on the old man.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Sorry about that!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (One sec lemme catch up
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) clapped her hands in appreciation.
    Watching a plan work to perfection was akin to completing a marthon. 

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s great. I wanted to show you a sample, but it looks like my doll was ripped in the process. Forgive me.&#34;</font>

The woman drips a hand into her backpocket. <font color = white>&#34;All I need from you is three angle shots and atleast a day&#39;s worth of time. The Akihabar Merchants can return to hand deliver your item...&#34;</font>

She pauses again, and looks around.
   <font color = white>&#34;..you are the most popular and influential shinobi in the land,&#34;</font> she says with a hint of doubt, brows risen. 
                      <font color = white>&#34;..right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: There are a couple of terms we Akihabara Merchants have.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) blinked a few times listening along quietly. This is where the dolls had come from? Well, at least it made sense now.

Letting out a sigh, she would begin speaking.
 <font color = white>&#34;Unfortunately we&#39;re a bit.. Lacking, in terms of &#39;famous&#39; Shinobi at the moment. Aside from the three of us here. Lord Tomoe, our Tsuchikage, has departed to your village along with an escort that consists of.. A large amount of our troops.&#34;</font>, she said with a nod.

Looking over the group that had come once again, she releases a small chuckle.
 <font color = white>&#34;Though, I suppose there&#39;s no harm in allowing you time to make your dolls. So long as the other merchants here are taking orders for our up-and-coming Genin.&#34;</font>

She directed her attention back towards the three in the center of the room.
 <font color = white>&#34;And to answer your question, yes. There are few more notable than Mugen and myself.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Narusari, Yuu(The old merchant-MyG) OOCs: (did my say get eatne?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) scrambles to her seat, <font color = white>&#34;Understood miss! Please direct me to whoever is available and fits the description! After the meeting of course. That&#39;s all I had.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: In the future, I believe it would wise to also employ the use of your shinobis when it comes to requiring protection for our caravans.
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: That could be arranged, though there would need to either be payment or an exchange of goods.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: We also require the ability to come into and exit your lands at our leisure, this ability would cover our escourts as well. We of course would submit to all of your rules and laws
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi(The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) OOCs: (Rip Mugen)
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Mhm.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) mulled over the thought for a moment. Allowing anyone free passage into the village was often something that took a long and tedious process to approve. However..
 <font color = white>&#34;Sure. So long as you submit to random luggage checks, just to ensure the safety of those inside.&#34;</font>, she said with a nod. <font color = white>&#34;Likely not everytime, and maybe never. But, it is the price for free access without needing someone escorting you around the village.&#34;</font>

As she finished, she leaned forward, placing her elbow on the desk and resting her head on her hand.
 <font color = white>&#34;Aside from that, you&#39;re merchants so allowing you access to deal with our forces is only beneficial.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) rubbed his chin.
<font color = white>&#34;Yes our Shinobi are more than capable..&#34;</font>,he noded.

<font color = white>&#34;There are security concerns and open border would incur yes, not long random inventory checks but we would have to supply limited seals or talismans only to be distributed to offical merchants of this trade agreement..&#34;</font>,the mans mind was working out all the issues with the deal, that could threaten the safety of his village.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (*not only 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) nods his head in agreement, <font color = white>&#34;We are nuetral in all manners, I assure you no Akihabara Merchant would knowingly allow his or her trade to be hijacked by anyone with ill intentions. Still, I understand to make sure we are doing what we say we are and nothing more.&#34;</font>

Yuu rests his other hand on his cane, <font color = white>&#34; I&#39;m old enough to have seen a war or two in my life time, nasty bussiness!&#34;</font>

Yuu shakes his head, <font color = white>&#34; We request that we be left out of all wars concerning you and your allies and enemies, bussiness must go on, if a Akihabara merchant is caught between you and and enemy, we request that our merchants not be harmed in the conflict so long as they do not attempt to interfere in the fight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) twirled his fishing pole while the old man was talking and he realized he would have to get stronger soon.

Once I complete my training it&#39;s up for evil doers!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) nodded along in agreement. Merchants were akin to civilians, just people looking to make a living off of their trade. There was often little reason, or tactical benefit, in harming a civilian-- Let alone one that also benefitted everyone.

Turning towards Mugen for a moment, she&#39;d nod a single time before shifting back towards Yuu.
 <font color = white>&#34;That is fine. As long as the village of Akihabara remains neutral in any and all conflicts, then they will be guaranteed safety from the forces of Iwagakure.&#34;</font>, she&#39;d state flatly, pausing for a moment after. <font color = white>&#34;However.&#34;</font>

She sat back up, placing both hands on the table in front of her. It was rare, if ever, to see the Shingen Jonin speak in a serious tone or even give much thought and care to what she was doing. The one thing she would never slack on, though, was the safety of those around her. Their Tsuchikage being a shining star of an example that she wished to follow.
 <font color = white>&#34;If at any point that neutrality is broken, there will be consequences to pay and the village will be seen as an enemy. As well, if there are any conflicts within our borders, your merchants are to bring it up to either Mugen or myself, should Lady Tomoe not be around. Any hostility will void all neutrality views.&#34;</font>

She paused for a moment again.
 <font color = white>&#34;This doesn&#39;t mean our Shinobi will bring harm to any of you, and if anyone tries unprovoked I will handle it personally.&#34;</font>, she vented a sigh, leaning back into her chair. <font color = white>&#34;Is this clear?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) need not say anything, only letting the weight of his chakra press down on the merchants and the seriousness of his aura speak for him. The jounin nodding towards his partner a sign of his full support and backing of her statement.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Reasonable
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) offered a smile and thumbs up.
 <font color = white>&#34;Cool!&#34;</font>, her youth shining through. <font color = white>&#34;All is good then, yeah?&#34;</font>

She stretched herself out, pushing against the chair to lean back on two legs as she did.
 <font color = white>&#34;Whew! Meetings suck.&#34;</font>, she continued, a small <i>thud</i> echoing out as she stopped stretching. <font color = white>&#34;Is there anything else?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) whispers: ur booty looks delectable from this angle 
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: They do suck.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would form a reassuring small smile.as she formed a unsure look before raising a hand to cover her mouth. Coughing a bit....

T-that was..sudden...but then she heared something about meetings sucking and she spoke there after. <font color = white>&#34;definately..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Merchant.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Hmmm

   <font color = white>&#34;Do you all make Tonfas?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Am I forgetting anything?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Oh, let me get those photos and we can go back home!
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: ..and that guy wants Sofas.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Tonfa? That's doable.
<br><font color=teal>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'd like to make an order.
