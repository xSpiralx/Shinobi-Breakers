<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) snorted, and raised a hand to mask away her smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) spun so that he was sideways compared to Hanako and stepped forward, getting a little too close to be able to say he respect people's personal space.
