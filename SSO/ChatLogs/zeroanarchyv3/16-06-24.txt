He gives her a playful touch on the arm as if he thought he was being loving and romantic..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Ill take my buns toasted, extra mayo with bacon and chopped chicken.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Tomatos, and add a little pepper.

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: You heard the crowd!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: We want our buns toasted!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Toasty buns!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) yells: Toasted Buns!!!!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Buns...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Beef Bacon in between...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) looked towards the red eyed girl and scratched his cheek.
<font color = white>&#34;Er.. I&#39;m just makin&#39; sure he ain&#39;t sleepin&#39; on the job, that&#39;s all lady.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: What job, is that?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Mn...&#34;</font> The boy grunts in discomfort, someone is holding back. Or, worse yet: <i>somebody knows he&#39;s searching for them.</i>

Shuye&#39;s words pierce through his concentration just before he attempted to trudge deeper.
<font color = white>&#34;Mnh? O-Oh!.&#34;</font> He acknowledges Kunigami with a bow, clasping his hands together in the process. His eyes burn into the two-tone head&#39;s face for a second, just for a second though--a rare occasion on his part.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: OOOH  IDea...  What if we do like CHEECE TOASTED STUFFED TOASTED BUNS?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave them a nod and left it at that.
Now then...

...what's going on over there? He's finally free to focus on the chatter. People-watching and such. He took a seat on the arena's edge, listening in on this talk of sandwiches and holy matrimony(?). </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Eh. cheese, sorry I blanked out.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: All this food talk, someone's about to owe me a meal after this if it keeps going...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) drools a litte bit at Tsuneko's ideal.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Apologies... I had a reservation of thoughtlessless for a short time.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) waved her hand in front of the dark skinned not-quite-teen.

<font color = white>&#34;What job?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) closed her eyes, a vein buldged across her forehead -- though hidden by her bangs. Her irritation had reached its limit and although this boy didn&#39;t mean any harm she found his words to be truly demeaning. How dare he try bossing her around? That was her job.

<font color = white>&#34;You idiot!&#34;</font> she barked. With a clenched fist she sought to bonk the boy on the head. While she didn&#39;t really have any strength behind the punch, if it hit it&#39;d probably leave a lump on his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll never marry ya&#39;! Tha&#39; person I marry would know that -I&#39;m- tha&#39; prize damnit!&#34;</font> Reilin exclaimed. 
(D- Agi. Not actually trying to deal any damage so I guess E Str)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) placed a hand on his hip and tilts his head to the side.
<font color = white>&#34;The job ta be ready whenever an enemy invades the village, woman.&#34;</font> he told her plainly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept up her scowl, unamused.

<font color = white>&#34;He doesn&#39;t even have a headband. He has no job.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She's got a point! Sh- Er, both of the girls talking right now I guess.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) pondered if she should kick him into the moat, just to get revenge from earlier, but figured it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea.

Well, it was, because she&#39;d come up with it, but it would come with a degree of future revenge, probably.

<font color = white>&#34;Have fun with that. M&#39;gonna go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: NO for real......Whos making those sandwhiches.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No one is big guy. No one is...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was completely off guard as he was continuing to take orders and was decked with a &#39;powerful punch&#39; that sent him flying.

<font color = white>&#34;--Gaaaaaaahhh!&#34;</font>

He slams on the floor while skidding slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hrngh..Ouch..Y-you&#39;re the prize??&#34;</font>

He grunts as he raises up to his feet, rubbing the afflicted area.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay okay..I think I get it..Ill buy you an apron before you get to making the sandwhiches...And a hair net!&#34;</font>

(Damage taken!)</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Don't worry..she's making the sandwhiches!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..Ouch..what a punch..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) moves over and stares the Uchihue into the eyes!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a great prize, mhm mhm.&#34;</font>

Hmmm, sammiches sound good though.

The spider girl would side step away again as she stares up at the sky.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: The wonders of youth...but arent you a bit to young to be asking girls to become housewives.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) had a strong suspicion they would try to push him into the moat too. Weird that they didn't.
<b>The Fūma would remember this.</b> Perhaps he would go easy on her the next time the opportunity to throw blunt objects at faces arose. 

Either way, he continued to sit there, with a water bottle in hand. Idly taking sips. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: YeJie.... Who is that large Tuediean with the red hair and stave?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Too young? My paw said to find a beautiful girl and to marry her!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I don't know, Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: So I'm doing just that!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Eh hmm..That reminds me, I wonder if she has any pepper corn ranch...
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: Hey wife! You got any pepper corn ranch for my sandwich??
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) suddenly begins to sweat a little bit. It's a very delayed response, but he can feel Shuye's looking in his general direction. His eyes wander in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) glanced over.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey. The One who fell just before the Finish Line, considered quitting, but powered through with his pride intact. What&#39;s your name?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Six Arms, what's yer' name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her head toward Meixun then, giving Venturo a moment&#39;s repireve. She spoke, but the words didn&#39;t make any sense to anyone else at first, then.

<font color = white>&#34;You introduce yourself deferentially. Then you ask what his &#39;rank&#39; is-- He&#39;s old, so he&#39;s probably a chuunin. Unless he&#39;s talented, then he&#39;s probably a jounin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I am Tsuneko of the Tsuchigumo clan!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) felt satisfied after lashing out. Through she still held her fist up before lowering it just as Tsuneko made a remark. <font color = white>&#34;See? She gets it.&#34;</font> finally she slipped her hands into her pockets and looked toward the Troublemaker. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not makin&#39; any sandwiches! An&#39; I ain&#39;t marryin&#39; you!&#34;</font> she shook her head.

<font color = white>&#34;I might have&#39;ta knock more sense into ya&#39; if ya&#39; keep this up!&#34;</font> she stated. Though at the mention of peppercorn ranch she narrowed her gaze. Almost dumbfounded at this character. She could hardly believe it. But she did have an idea.

<font color = white>&#34;Listen.. If I&#39;m even gonna consider marryin&#39; you.. Ya&#39; gotta show me yer worth it.&#34;</font> she pinched her thumb and fingertips before rubbing them together, a universal signal for &#39;money&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Mugen(The iron vessel-Zombietron80) OOCs: (somber looking girl that profile ass
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) slowly steps side-ways along the edge of the arena. Moving closer to the masked rock-thrower while keeping his eyes on whatever thing is happening in across the moat. 

Leaning his head to the side, he says <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s Utsuwa Hideo. You&#39;re... something Katora, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) 's hands clasp together, his thumbs beginning to fidget. He's confident that he's the one being stared at...
... Then he feels her direction change. Something grabbed her attention, and thus was his time to make his great escape.. but he'd have to do it in a way that was subtle. One that wouldn't draw much attention. He could start running, he could leap across to the platform in the middle...

... Then it hit him.

He'd just... start walking away.
Very slowly.

Bit by bit...
Not once does he turn his head, to avoid making eye contact.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Xun? They have a rank of my name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) continues to rub his cheek and listens to the girl and notices that sign.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh..I think I get it..So to marry you I must get money! Do not worry, I will buy your love someday. Remember the name, Kaido! Iwagakure&#39;s most crafty ninja.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Yes. Katora. Fūma Clan. 
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Reilin do you like Kimono?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Nice to meet you
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Hey guys, we're going to have to put a hold on those sandwhiches for a while!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Nooooooooooo my sammich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a light laugh at the happenings across the moat. 
<font color = white>&#34;Ha... Kunoichi are scary.&#34;</font> A statement made with slow shakes of head. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Kinda cool. In a cute way.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: The Utsuwa family, huh? Can't say I've heard of them. What do they do?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched Venturo slowly depart, then snapped her eyes back to her brother, wondering which to answer first. Finally, she decided.

<font color = white>&#34;No, they don&#39;t. I&#39;d need to look in the textbook to get the exact definition. Just ask his name.&#34;</font> She said, before calling after Venturo.

<font color = white>&#34;Goodbye to you too then.&#34;</font> She sounded annoyed-- insulted, even.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Right, Kaido.. I'll make sure not ta' forget. I'm Uchiha, Reilin. Wish I could say it was nice ta' meet ya', Kaido but it ain't.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ehh, Kimono are nice.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Uhhhhhhhhhhhhh I don't know if my dad wants us to talk about that sort of thing or not.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why do ya' ask?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was merely gazing over the boys head, she did give a curious glance down at the fidgiting but alas....she was set to see the brewing lovers spat.

<font color = white>&#34;How calm it has become....I was hoping for something more entertaining to pass the time with.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: That's fair. Every family has their secrets.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I mostly meant the job-related stuff. Like, say, shopkeeping, blacksmithing, construction.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) grins at Rellin.

<font color = white>&#34;You won&#39;t be saying that when I become the richest in the village and a really successful shinobi..You&#39;ll be dying to marry me some day, Rellin Uchiha..So much, youll take my last name and drop the Uchiha from yours!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Hm? I dont care spread our name far and wide boyo! I do find it strange they havent heard of my last name. Moniker might be overshadowing it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) put a hand over her mouth at the mention of dropping her name. To onlookers she may have appeared shocked, but in reality she was stiffling her laughter.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh- We're all shinobi, I think. I 'unno what mom did before she passed. Or what our grandparents do, if anything. But dad's super cool and strong. And I wanna be too.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Right, I can't wait
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) has a pang hit him in the chest. Wait. Was he misreading the situation? He thought he was due for some sort of pummeling...but those words.. they couldn&#39;t have been for anyone else.

His contemplation is evident in the way he stops in his slow trek away. Not only did he fail in his mission, but he failed as a friend. As a teammate. As a lover of all things Earth.
To the child, these feelings all amalgamated into something he couldn&#39;t properly understand, but one thing he &lt;i&gt;did&lt;/i&gt; know for certain was that it didn&#39;t feel good.

He turns back around, non-chalantly as if he wasn&#39;t in the middle of sneaking just now.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh? What&#39;s up?&#34;</font> he says, putting on an act. <font color = white>&#34;I thought I saw another neat pebble, but no.. not this time. I wasn&#39;t going anywhere! We&#39;re hanging out, after all! ... Right?&#34;</font> 

Accompanied with his act was probably one of the largest, most genuine smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) taps his chin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) wonders for a time where his brother could be, though he eventually yields his mind to focus on himself.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) witnessed a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.

(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the rules of engagement from the light-haired senior who hosted this streamer game. It was unusual, something he wasn&#39;t used to, but truthfully it did sound a little fun. It was a raw test of agility and not much else.

  <font color = white>&#34;Seems like it&#39;ll be based mostly on chance if you make it to the end. I&#39;m game for a little flag tag.&#34;</font> He leans off the wall.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So what are streamers?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) hummed softly, not too sure how to come out of this successfully. She doubted she'd win but figured it'd be a good way to pass the time so she moved toward the crate and grabbed herself a velcro belt with one streamer each, strapping both to her hips.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) picks his nose without a care in the world, before tossing the booger to the side. Luckily, confucianism made it impossible for younger people to criticize the elderly.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohohoh.. Iwagakure sure loves its violence.&#34;</font> he comments as he takes a seat, fully intending to watch the brawl unfold</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: What are streamers? The red and blue fabric attached to your velcro belts.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) begins to roll his shoulders and grins at Katora. Knowing that the masked boy couldn&#39;t use his eagle eye to snipe flags off of belts. With his arms rudimentarily stretched he steps forward! Grabbing a belt and affixing the little streamers to the velcro spots on the belt.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright! I&#39;m gonna win- Wait how do we win this game? Do we collect a bunch of flags?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So ya lose both, you lose?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) barked out a laugh <font color = white>&#34;A fun game I suppose if not simple, if only I had some sake to sip as I watched.&#34;</font> She said notig the blonde had not replied to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;A more fitting name would be Royale Rumble.&#34;</font> She said as she stalked closer to the crate to reach in and secure her belt across her waist.
<font color = white>&#34;Let us dance then!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Percisely!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Who do I room with?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Or are we decidin' our opponents?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked to the set of velcro belts and put one of them on, adjusting it so it&#39;d feel comfortable for her. It would probablyy be a bit chaotic right from the get go so she did the smart thing of gettting a bit further away the moment she could to not get instantly defeated by everyone at once.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font> she breathed in, slowly inhaling and exhaling. <font color = white>&#34;Who wants to go?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) began to simply do jumping jacks to warm-up. He wasn&#39;t actually sure how this would go down. He wasn&#39;t exactly a beast at hand-to-hand combat or anything. At least not yet... But he did have a point earlier...

<font color = white>&#34;Gonna push past my limits... Hell yeah.&#34;</font>

After a few moments he hears Gosu approach and turns to face him with a smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers: Not much!

You picked the wrong guy to get out first.&#34;</font> Yurei stepped forward with the guile of a thief, closing in with a swipe of his arm to nab a streamer from the heaby one&#39;s belt in no time at all.

For some inexplainable reason he felt weird jumping someone in a bathroom. But it was, technically, in the name of the game! So he got over it pretty quickly. He wasn&#39;t sure if the prize was money or not but winning in of itself was pretty cool.

<font color = white>&#34;Technically he never said it&#39;d disqualify us- Just to not do it intentionally!&#34;</font>

He calls out as he steps forward and around the side of Yurei. Reaching out, he tries to swipe for one of the flags around the boys waist.

<font color = white>&#34;And my names, Hideo!&#34;</font>

[1/4]
  Directly afterwards, he would grab the belt off the chubby boy completely making his pants fall from his waist in a quick unrecoverable fashion.

  <font color = white>&#34;Why don&#39;tcha sit this one out, big guy. You aren&#39;t makin&#39; it.&#34;</font> He said with a smile.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Damn, that was pretty cool...&#34;</font>

He unknowingly mutters a stream of consciousness to his opponent. Eyes darting to Gosu as he watches his comrade get taken out so quickly. It seemed neither of them were really made for this sort of event...

<font color = white>&#34;Raaah! I still have to try! To push past my limits!&#34;</font>

Shouting valiantly as he chases after Yurei and attempts to swipe at the flags around his waist once again!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) twisted his waist narrowly to evade the reach towards his belt and returned with his own vast low hook to snag the streamer of Hideo.

  His other hand dropped Gosu&#39;s belt so that perhaps he could scramble to redo his britches.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll just have to take you both out then. Definitely earnin&#39; the name nincompoop right now.&#34;</font>

Which, he manages to pull off! Only slightly though. It&#39;s obvious he doesn&#39;t have much more of those kinds of moves in him...

<font color = white>&#34;Tch! You&#39;re the nicompoop!&#34;</font>

Shouting as he regains his balance and steps forward. Performing his own swipe toward Yurei once more.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) dodged the grab on him before mirroring Hideo's moves, just much faster. He pulls off a close-range grabbed on the redheads shirt before aiming to secure a grip onto the streamer.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) spins like a monkey. Trying to leverage the movement into breaking Yurei&#39;s grip of his shirt <i>and</i> avoid his flag being stolen.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh damn...&#34;</font>

He mumbles as he recovers from the movement and attempts to dive around the side of his target. Swiping towards his flags as he moves.

[4/4]

  <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t tell me you ain&#39;t havin&#39; the fun you expected to have, huh?!~&#34;</font> It&#39;s as if Yurei had been searching for an opening.
 Getting beside Hideo he yanks at the belt to secure a streamer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) rolls around along the bathroom floor like a tantruming toddler. Though, his intent was to evade rather than look like an idiot. Unfortunately failing in both regards...

He quickly pushes himself back up to his feet. Mimicking Yurei&#39;s earlier movement by leaping forward as soon as he was grounded. Snatching one of his opponent&#39;s flags in response!

Triumphantly waving it through the air he retorts,

<font color = white>&#34;I mean- This is kinda fun, yeah! Winning doesn&#39;t really matter to me when money isn&#39;t on the line!&#34;</font>

Looking at the flag... He ponders if he can just attach it to his own belt and restore his missing one... Eventually shaking his head and simply backing up toward the door. Streamer secured, time to flee!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) quite simply wasn&#39;t going to let him off after being the reason he&#39;s now a streamer down.

  <font color = white>&#34;Oh no ya&#39; don&#39;t.&#34;</font> He pursues in order to finish the game and tackles his backside or front, whatever he needs to in order to secure the banner.

Throwing himself to the right in an attempt to avoid the attack. Only to basically slam himself into the wall.

Taking a deep breath in an attempt to recover, he continues fleeing! This wasn&#39;t a fight he would win... He needed to try and get someone else involved...

Completely ignoring the fact that Kusa had slipped into the bathroom a little bit ago. He wasn&#39;t especially observant.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah damn it.&#34;</font>

Before looking over his shoulder and grinning at Yurei.

<font color = white>&#34;I may lose, but I&#39;m not gonna just give you the win for free! I&#39;m petty as hell!&#34;</font>

He raises his foot up against the door frame of the bathroom and kicks off it! Leaping backwards! In a completely mundane way though. Just enough effort to evade the swipe for a final time... He was surely done for after this...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) followed him outside of the bathroom door, yanking him backwards by the belt in order to reel him back in like a fish that had pulled the bait too far out.
  <font color = white>&#34;Where you think you&#39;re goin&#39;, nincompoop?&#34;</font>

There was an aura of focus around him, as if this was just an excellent game that he enjoyed so thoroughly that his state had been altered. Kicking off Hideo&#39;s back, Yurei would aim to secure the very last streamer.

  <font color = white>&#34;N&#39; that&#39;s that.&#34;</font> He said with closed eyes and a sharp smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) flops onto the ground with a chuckle. At least he secured a single streamer... That&#39;s a win in his book. Given that money wasn&#39;t on the line-
