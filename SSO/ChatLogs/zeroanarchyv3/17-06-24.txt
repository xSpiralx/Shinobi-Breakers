<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [that's correct, if two people attack you in melee, you use highest agility.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (what if the person with the highest agiility stops attack for one turn, do u reset to the 2nd person's dt and go back to full?)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) takes himself a loss, judging by Fubuki&#39;s frantic tone--it may have been too brash of an underestimate at hand. He&#39;ll have little to no choice but to continue on with pressuring Yurei, after all--he&#39;s not out of the fight just yet.
Kicking into a more aggresive gear, the boy fiends for an opening, unrelenting with his strikes despite being on the backfoot of their situation.

<font color = white>&#34;Continuous disproportion...!&#34;</font> He commands Fubuki, just a strange way to say &#39;&#39;keep stalling&#39;&#39; if nothing else.

More or less the problem lies in how long the girl herself is able to fend off Chonamu.

<font color = white>&#34;The belt! Go after THE BELT.&#34;</font> she yelled out to her opponent while once more moving her arm towards Yurei&#39;s waist and snatch his banner , perhaps if she got lucky enough she could take one of his banners though she doubted it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Sakujak, Ryohei (The short-tempered youth-Kwaj874) kept his gaze trained upon the man situated at their front door, his arms folded over his chest. With his eyesight, he&#39;s able to pick up on the man&#39;s items from afar.

Two swords, and a bunch of bloodied headbands of the fallen. It causes his expression to sour. The message was heard loud and clear-- an obvious threat.

<font color = white>&#34;Those headbands...&#34;</font> he says, kicking off of the wall to land down below. He commits the man&#39;s face to memory, not crazy enough to pick a fight without tools of his own.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana listened intently as the mechanical voice filled the air, her heart pounding with fear and determination. She observed the envoy steadily, taking in every word and detail. Her eyes briefly flickered to the bloodied headbands, a surge of sorrow, but she remained silent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) wasn&#39;t quite sure what was going on so for the most part she intended to remain quiet and observant, seeing as a Chuunin was called, this certainly wasn&#39;t her place to step forward or engage in any fashion. Being as short as she was, it was a bit tough to see through the crowd so she stepped forward somewhat to get a better look of things.

It was declared that some of the headbands belonged to their own. She cut a sharp gaze toward the &#39;messenger&#39;. Though unknown to her, she was visibly irritated that people from her home had been cut down. Someday her and her friends would be out there.

<font color = white>&#34;Tch...&#34;</font> still she remained quiet.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) arrives later than intended due to some difficulties. He stares at the man who arrived, at the bloodied headbands, and at the reactions of all those around him.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) lip curled, she was in no place to speak on such matters but she could not help but say something loud enough for her peers to hear. 

<font color = white>&#34;There is only one of them.&#34;</font> She pointed out and looked at the back of the older Shinobi. Would such an offense be let to pass? They had the bodies....but she was one of those bodies herself....</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) looked at sensei as soon as the headbands.<font color = white>&#34;So we are next? I hope not. But you got it.&#34;</font>The teenager seemed too calm and not stressing over the situation. He had full hope in his sensei to beat this guy to death. Taking out his book he would sit down and turn a page. He then noticed Shuye arrived and waved.<font color = white>&#34;Oh hey Shuye you came to the party or warning of this guy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Calmness remained with him throughout the stiff warning.

A Swordsman Messenger declared those he represented an enemy of their entire village. The foremost thought on his mind, reflected from a statement like that, could only be...

<font color = white>&#34;Their days are numbered.&#34;</font>
A soft, muffled murmur, beyond earshot.

More importantly, he&#39;s eager to see whether their superiors might shoot this messenger, who arrived here bearing the highest of hostilities. It was only karma. Right?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka)  From a squatting position, the girl would begin slapping the ground with three hands to voice her disgust for this kind of attitude!  This was sounding much like a threat, as if he was bragging about killing their genin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ayyo!  How brave!  Killing genin younger than yerself, must feel nice, ye?  Then coming to our gates?  Bragging?  threatening?  Ay ay ay ay.   Message recieved.&#34;</font>

Yeah, this Tsuchigumo girl was pissed, she was ready for a fight!  BRING IT!  Though as for making decisions or actions?  That&#39;s left to Bathroom Sensei.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) couldn't really see the bloody headbands because; his eye sight was awful, and because there were a bunch of people in the way. So the weight of the man's threatening speech didn't really land with the generally dumb boy.

But he did at least still understand it was a threat. It sounded like people had been caught by... bandits? Probably bandits. Outside the walls or something similar. A mostly uneeded warning for Hideo as he had no desire to go beyond the walls to begin with.

The guy had a bunch of swords, for example. What did he have? A cool rock he found on the way here and some loose change. It would take a long while before he was confident and geared enough to much further than he was right now. But he would go that far eventually.

Someone had to avenge who ever the messenger had, probably, killed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) was a bit at a loss, but found herself setting forwards....this was um...no she didnt think she would be the one to handle duties like this...b-but she was the only one awake so...

She sighed and stepped forwards...her students in more ways than one..each showing their own reaction but...most of fustration or well...taunting much less...an act of mmm....an act of...mm.

<font color = white>&#34;just stop it, you cant bind us to the village.&#34;</font>

She found her self looking back to the students..<font color = white>&#34;..mm...ehh..&#34;</font> they found their gaze falling back onto the man south of her. <font color = white>&#34;the entire wilderness is not your territoy. This village and the everything in a one click area of this place is apart of our land&#34;</font> She paused.

<font color = white>&#34;what is your leaders true intentions...&#34;</font>

To those with ever keen sight, his body had very clear grooves but not like the carving of wood into puppetry - it was more refined and held smoother parts.

If he was going to face an attack here, he at least had an ace up his sleeve. The actions were entirely dependent on Iwagakure though, as he attempts to let them collect and be on his way</font></font></font>

Hana continued to listen to the commanding man, her attention unwavering despite the discomfort gnawing at her. The mechanical timbre of his voice grated against her ears, and the sudden switch to a childlike tone sent a shiver down her spine, amplifying the unease she felt.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) brought her knuckles to her chin as she observed quietly. Shuye's talents were lacking in this department. She was not particularly observant; she didn't have the uncanny ability to sense the energy in things her brother had, either. Worse, she was barely a genin, physically. No, explosive ordnance disposal was far beyond her capabilities.

She wouldn't have spotted them without another shinobi calling it out.

A traitor to the village, daring to come to the front gates...?

Was Iwagakure so weak?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) approached the scene, her eyes scanning over the crowd carefully before noticing someone outside of the gate-- Of course there was.

A sigh escaped her as she leapt overtop of the students, landing next to Chocho. Turning to face her for a moment, a smile is flashed, followed by a peace sign. She then finally turns her attention onto the stranger at their gates.
 <font color = white>&#34;Yo.&#34;</font>, she called out, looking him over from head to toe.

The camera in his eye was instantly spotted, alerting her to put her guard up. Perhaps it was nothing, or perhaps someone was actually coming to spy on them. Either way, it was work she didn&#39;t plan on having to deal with.
 <font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re just dropping stuff off, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font>, she began, her eyes looming over to the field behind him, noting the vast amount of explosive tags that were placed.

 <font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;know.. Someone has to clean those up, and it isn&#39;t gonna be me!&#34;</font>, she protested, venting another sigh. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever.. If there&#39;s nothing else, then be on your way so I can find someone else to paw- I mean.. Delegate.. This task to...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;u-unfortunately not..theres about...one more you might have to suffer through...before we go into..the next section.&#34;</font>

She paused.

<font color = white>&#34;b-but i dont really have a suiton tile..so your lucky mhm!..&#34;</font> With a light wink..she found herself continueing there after. <font color = white>&#34; For suiton..it mostly messes with your movement across the field...if i remeber correctly...same with fuuton....with the case it knocks you back....so your all fine on that front&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s eyes widened, her soul was ready to die as soon as Koume mentioned there was one more tile to go. But thankfully the game was still in early access and the suiton tile hadn&#39;t been added, so she sighed out of happiness and laid on the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m free...from the pain--&#34;</font>

And then the obstacle course turned into the other one.

<font color = white>&#34;...Fuck.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would poof away her previous course and summoned a new one into existance. Upon returning...she looked to the yellow mushroom.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) smirked when the shuriken had been thrown, and then her expression turned into dread and horror as the mushroom was running at her. It gave her flashbacks of all the times she had been hit and sent back a tile. Though thankfully when it dropped dead she could calm down, also taking some steps back.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh, I see.&#34;</font> She grabbed the piece of paper and read it for a bit before handing it back. <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, that was nice and uhh...not torture, like earlier.&#34;</font> Fubuki&#39;s body still had burn marks.</font></font></font>

As Asuno finished and introduced her plushie project, Kohana smiled politely, though her mind was still on the music. <font color = white>&#34;Not bad,&#34;</font> she replied diplomatically. <font color = white>&#34;But honestly, the tune was a bit too slow for my taste. I&#39;m more of a rhythm and soul person. Still, I&#39;m curious about your plushie project. What kind of design are you thinking about?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eyes widen with excitement as he saw many people lined up. Could this be a ninja wonder-land? As he continued to move around, he'd take note of the uniform worn by the strangers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I won't be selling anything today, but I can take orders.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Asuno on the other hand, will be.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: The design'll be made from a person here today, if there is more than one person that is interested, then we will have to play a game to find out who will be chosen.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: So this is Akihabara?..
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: What can I order with three hundred ryo? It's all I have after all. I'm looking for a blade.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (how tf does a donkey sound
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: ...This is the land of Akihabara?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (hee haw?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: So for a basic full tang katana. Can we say what amount of ryo is an acceptable fee?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Can I order 'sum 'rmor for two 'hunnit?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Wagon (The old man's wagon-) stomps the ground with his proud hooves, leaving deep marks on dirt.
Were it not for his owner's hand he might have already kicked the boy in the face.

"<i>AGGRESSIVE DONKEY SOUNDS</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) was curious what he'd could request here in the distant land.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: I guess I'll wait my turn... but I could definately use some senbons.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Don't be silly boy.. why are you trying to talk to a donkey? Donut might be smart, but he can't speak..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I'm afraid you children don't have enough for katanas or armor.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) moved towards the part of the table with the senbons on display.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm....
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Imagine approaching a rabid animal.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) sighed kinda disappointed, but she expected it. <font color = white>&#34;Alright then, at least gimme a goal - how much will I need in the future?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: An estimate works.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: A number would be nice, yes.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: If you're interested in purchasing a Ogura original, please tell me your name and what weapon you wish to have made.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: How much for a kuai?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes a moment to really experience the music. As she was of foreign origin, her music style was different than anything that had influenced him locally.
  It was peaceful, a meditation, and thought-provoking. There was a certain free essence to it.

   Yurei thought that it was beautiful, and so he stared at the young woman a bit slack-jawed.

  <font color = white>&#34;If you want me as a doll, I could help.&#34;</font> The Mugen said, blushing at her talents!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) makes a mental note on the composed girl. No one offends his donkey without getting economic sanctions..</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned toward the thoughtful, composed girl who had also offered to be used as inspiration.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t back down.&#34;</font> She asserted. <font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll have to play whatever game A&#39;suno decides upon.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm Fubuki, I want a katana - one day I'll return with 700 more ryo and order it from you.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: ...!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Indeed. Or you can work in the mines for three years.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen ever so slightly as he stops just a few inches out of the donkie&#39;s hoof range.
     <font color = white>&#34;...Are-&#34;</font> - He looks at the old man. <font color = white>&#34;Would you say that this Donkey is a partner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Fubuki so you have 300?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I do yes.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: We will have to play indeed. Lets get away from the crowd. If you're interested in being a contestant for the very first edition of my plushies. Please follow me a bit north. I will then detail how the game will work.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Partner? He is my traveling partner..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh.. I wonder if Kaido would want somethin..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I suggest you all follow Asuno.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: How much for senbon kind sir?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) hopes that the kid didn't mean any other deranged form of partner.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) pumps a fist into the air.
  <font color = white>&#34;A&#39;right.&#34;</font> He smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I will have prices for weapons and more by the time you all become shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: In buisness.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: For now, the forge is closed. I will accept orders, though.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Mhm.. Donut would be my employee.. right.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Hoshino Kohana handed Fubuki 200 ryo with a playful smile. <font color = white>&#34;Here, take this.

<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Fubuki, I'll mark you down for a katana.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks down to the soil in thought.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: Now to raise 500 more ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: You don't listen very well, do you?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Will we have permits to travel to these lands?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Also can you save and order for me? One Kunai and 10 senbons?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Did you ask them?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afro,i will check whats going on over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) needed a moment to realize she suddenly got a bunch of money from her new friend. <font color = white>&#34;Wait are you sure about this?!&#34;</font> then quickly she had to turn around to talk to the blacksmith, she was very overwhelmed by all of these things going on. <font color = white>&#34;O-okay then! I &#39;unno exactly when I&#39;ll pay you back but I&#39;ll come back and pay full price! Thank you mister!&#34;</font> she bowed towards Junji before looking at Hana again. <font color = white>&#34;Okay, I owe you one big time. I won&#39;t forget this. Now, are we going to check out that game?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Forgive me merchant, what might I refer you as?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) looks to the side, as his very poor hearing still managed to catch some of the discussion.
<font color = white>&#34;Keh keh.. young man. I already told them about the supply chain issues. But do you think kids that still smell of milk can understand?&#34;</font> he chuckles</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Junji Ogura.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I have you marked down for the kunai and senbon.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: One of you spoke about a game correct?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) ignored the manner as to which the merchant was flamboyant, and offer a smile. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Junji of the Ogura family.

<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Yes!

I remember how much it meant to him. And I think I will pass on the game. I&#39;m suddenly feeling a daze.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Is it free one?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: But goodluck!

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So who do I talk to about gettin' some shuriken sets and a kunai?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i just remember i gotta leave irl in less than an hour lol)

He states before bowing to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you for the insight.&#34;</font>

With that he wanders off to find his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Yurei.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Weird kid. But at least he got manners..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Hey mista', what's on the menu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) points to himself when hearing the mention of weapons.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm going to buy that man's horse.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: How would the old man react to you bringing a horse home?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks toward the ground in thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I suppose you're right.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...buying their horse will be very wrong.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shakes his head. <font color = white>&#34;This old man hasn&#39;t brought anything beside..&#34;</font> he rummages through his pockets <font color = white>&#34;..two sticks worth of joints. But I doubt kids like you would be interested.&#34;</font> he shrugs, as he rolls a cig for himself.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Well shiit'
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: We don't have them in stock yet, old man.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: No one gon' know, 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to the male. <font color = white>&#34;...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It's not a horse. It's a donkey.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yells: Tsk-tsk.. kids these days.. I am a moral merchant! Shoo!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Yes'suh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) chuckles, stepping back and munching on his bag of Burritos</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So yer' a merchant that doesn't have anything to sell?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) tucks the flute into her back pocket in exchange for a pair of white dice. 
       <font color = white>&#34;This is a game I learned as a child and I used it to determine who would have leftovers between me and my late brother.&#34;</font>

The tone was upbeat despite the tragic news. 

<font color = white>&#34;The game is simple and the winner will model and recieve the very first edition of my plushie collection for free. I&#39;ll start to sell them afterwards, and that is assuming you make enough of a name for yourself to earn one.&#34;</font>

The dice are thrown into the center for the group to expect. The numbers were digital-and advanced. <font color = white>&#34;The game is called &#39;200&#39;. Everyone will roll the dice using &#39;200&#39;. The number you get will act as your next roll number, and it could range from 199-to-1, it all depends on your luck.&#34;</font>

With a soft laugh, she concludes. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll keep rolling &#39;your&#39; lowest number until you get to &#39;1&#39;. The last person to hit &#39;1&#39; will be the winner. Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Maybe we should be talkin' to that one over there.. I think they said their name was Junji or somethin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shooes away the willful kid as he turns his attention to Ogura <font color = white>&#34;You are correct young man. The supply chain won&#39;t be fixed for a couple of months still.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: inspect*
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'm a girl..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sorry to hear that flute girl..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It's okay, that is a story for another time.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But alright...guess i will play,i already know im gonna lose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her attention back to A&#39;suno, and listened. As she started to describe the game, the smaller, blue-haired, angry-looking girl recognized it as the same game that other children had been playing near the arena. It even had the same name. She wondered if it spread from Akihabara, or if it had just spread to Akihabara. Either way, she was ready to play.

<font color = white>&#34;Prepare to lose, Yurei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah, right
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Hey, mista'
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's hope this one isn't just for show..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the explanation of the game.
 <font color = white>&#34;Sounds like it&#39;s based on a roll of the dice.&#34;</font> Therefore in his mind, if he lost, it was only fate.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got this. Their gonna be sowing Mugen dolls until their fingers bleed. Ehahaha.&#34;</font> He laughed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares at the plump youth for a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t sell armor in your size, yet.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I look forward to the challenge, "Mugen".
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: A duel... of the fates.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: If you're ready, you guys can circle up and start.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who is going first?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I will.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Come closer.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: The forge isn't open at the moment, but I can take orders.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) ponders for a moment. <i><font color = white>&#34;Luck..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I will join.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) reached into her pocket--

<font color = white>&#34;Actually, I don&#39;t have a dice. Can I borrow one, A&#39;suno?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hrnn
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So how's it work? We place an order an' then you come to our village to deliver?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) sweatdrops</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) flips a pair of cubes in the girl&#39;s direction. <font color = white>&#34;Here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: We can start at Shuye then work ourselves clockwise.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I can come to you or you can come to me. Either works.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I just need a name and what you need.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) caught the cubes and then, with a twirl, unleashed them onto the ground between them!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Terrible...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: I've seen worse! Good roll!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will grab the dice and roll</font></font></font>
