She halted before him, surprised to find someone actually her height, and age amongst the crowd of young teens.

It didn&#39;t sound like a request, but it wasn&#39;t spoken particularly forcefully either.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;How.. to aim?&#34;</font>

Aiming. Aiming. Err. Exactly how would someone place words to an explanation like that? Internal questionings surfaced in the wrinkle of brow while he pondered. Uh... 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nothing special. It&#39;s not something someone can really teach as much as it is something your body learns. You just have to throw a lot. I&#39;ve been throwing things ever since I learned how to close my fingers around objects, so..&#34;</font>

He paused to pluck up a flat stone. A whip of arm sent it spiraling like shuriken for the moat water. It skips a grand total of seven times before hitting the distant northeastern moat-wall with a solid clack!

<font color = white>&#34;.. practice makes perfect?&#34;</font>
He shrugs.</font></font></font>

A moment&#39;s spent gazing across the moat, at all their peers, before refocusing on the tall one. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the latter. I gave up on learning my family&#39;s... <i>primary business</i> to do this. Never too late to start learning how to do violence for profit. Right?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: Hey i could go for a sandwhich.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wish I had an allowance...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I want a sandwich.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I know a sandwich sounds good..Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Reilin!  I will adopt you for sandwiches!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) tilted his head. Err. Couldn&#39;t walk for a year-- 
Yeah, that sounds like the kind of personal matters anyone with basic common decency shouldn&#39;t ask about. So he didn&#39;t!

<font color = white>&#34;I see. Well. Best of luck to you, in your future laden with dodging rocks for the rest of the year. I won&#39;t go easy on you, if the legal opportunity finds me again,&#34;</font> he told them, wearing an unseen grin. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Gonna eat like an Akimichi tonight!  YAHOOO!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) moved on as briskly as that, offering no explanation for her extended spot of immobility.

<font color = white>&#34;Best o&#39; luck fer ye, too. Ah ain&#39; intendin&#39; t&#39;get hit &#39;gain.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was in a different state of mind when he's.... Focusing. He didn't even acknowledge his new acquaintances' remark, his body simply reacting to the forces with no reply.

Everyone's chakra felt the same, regardless of si--well, no.... Some people's chakra felt, subdued. Though the child still wasn't able to pinpoint exactly who was causing the... Discrepancy within his memory.
He could continue deeper if he'd wish, though it'd more than likely lead him to some unnecessary detailing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s listened to the offer given before taking a short breath. Just as she exhaled, her once somber demeanour had changed. Her eyes were piercing as she looked toward the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.. Who tha&#39; heck do ya&#39; take me for? Some kinda&#39; bum? Only one here who&#39;s gonna be makin&#39; sandwiches fer&#39; you is yer&#39; mum. Now buzz off &#39;fore I throw ya&#39; in the water!&#34;</font> she retorted. Her tone was vulgar and riddled with slang. Her once prim-and-proper way of speaking had vanished at the drop of a hat and she&#39;d tilted her nose up, even if she were shorter she found a way to still look down her nose at the boy. She almost seemed like a bit of a delinquent in the moment.</font></font></font>
