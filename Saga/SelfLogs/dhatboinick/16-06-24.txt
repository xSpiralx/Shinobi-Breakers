<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Sogeki&#39;s relentless stride towards Higane slows as her words cut through the air, piercing his focus like a well-aimed blade. Her snicker and taunt reach him clearly, igniting a flicker of irritation in his eyes that he struggles to conceal behind a mask of stoicism.

He hears her accusations about his demeanor, about not understanding what it means to be revered, to carry the weight of expectations. For a moment, Sogeki&#39;s gaze intensifies with a silent challenge, his jaw tensing imperceptibly.

<font color = white>&#34;You think I don&#39;t know pressure?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice is low, carrying a hint of raw intensity. <font color = white>&#34;Being at the top means everyone&#39;s watching, waiting for you to slip. It&#39;s a different kind of pressure, one that fuels me.&#34;</font>

His demeanor shifts subtly, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. <font color = white>&#34;But that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, isn&#39;t it? To show them all who stands at the pinnacle.&#34;</font> His tone is nonchalant yet laced with confidence, his eyes locking onto Higane&#39;s with a calculated glare.

Despite her faltering stance, Sogeki remains cautious, sensing an opportunity amidst her wavering resolve. His own pride and determination drive him forward, pushing him to capitalize on the moment and assert his dominance once more.

To think that none of this would have happened if she didnt hear fellow nearby colleague speak of how mighty the Hyuuga believe themselves to be.

Like a fortress crumbling under the weight of a dragons paw, Higane drops her stance and backs off, raising a heavy hand high above her head. <font color = white>&#34;I surrender.&#34;</font> She laments.

The spiral of ying and yang emotions bubbling inside her could not be quelled, at least not now and not here. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;l change the stigma. Mark my words.&#34;</font>

These are the last things the young girl says as she backs off taking a seat on a nearby colum.. She flips her pouch around..

Now fully visible was the Cadeuces Staff and the Red Cross, labeled across her pouch. She remained there idle and fumbling through her supplies ignoring any attempts at discussion.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Sogeki&#39;s intense gaze follows every movement of Higane&#39;s retreat, his expression a mix of frustration and disappointment. He had been ready for a clash of wills, eager to prove his dominance in combat, but now that opportunity slipped away with her surrender.

<font color = white>&#34;What? You&#39;re giving up just like that?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice carries a hint of irritation, his brow furrowing deeply. His hands clench into fists at his sides as he steps closer, his posture tense with pent-up energy.

<font color = white>&#34;You had me on the ropes, and now you&#39;re backing down?&#34;</font> His words are sharp, laced with a mixture of scolding and begrudging respect. <font color = white>&#34;You talk a big game, but you fold when things get tough. How do you expect to change any stigma like that?&#34;</font>

Despite his frustration, Sogeki&#39;s features contort into a slightly exaggerated scowl, emphasizing his displeasure at the anticlimactic end to their confrontation. His pride demanded a real challenge, not a forfeit, and he couldn&#39;t hide his disappointment at the missed opportunity for a true test of his abilities.

<font color = white>&#34;Next time, don&#39;t surrender so easily,&#34;</font> he mutters under his breath, turning away with a dismissive wave of his hand. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</font> With that, he stalks off, his demeanor a mix of simmering anger and determination to find a more satisfying challenge elsewhere.<br>(Satetsu, Sogeki)</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;You think thats bad? Having no monetary support by your father so you can get anything and everything? Tsk,tsk..Perhaps for you is bad,afterall you are spoiled since birth.

But let me say it again,what you experience at this moment...is what everyone NORMAL experience.You want your stuff? earn it.Do you think your old man got the money out of nowhere? That they didn&#39;t struggled? Or your ancestor didn&#39;t struggle? Cause let me tell you something..Without your father,and your ancestors trying their best...you would had been just like us,another small family member of a family which isn&#39;t noble,Neither anyone cares to know their name all around their town.&#34;</font>They will pause afterwhich will continue

<font color = white>&#34;So prove yourself as senju and earn what you belive is your right to have.The other option it to beg your old man untill he dies.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Sogeki strides purposefully towards the stern boy who had made disparaging remarks about the tournament he had invested time in organizing. His expression is a mix of annoyance and determination, his steps echoing with a quiet intensity as he closes the distance.

<font color = white>&#34;You got something to say about my tournament?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice cuts through the air, carrying a sharp edge of confrontation. His eyes narrow slightly, fixed on the stern boy, demanding an explanation or confrontation.

The stern boy turns to face Sogeki, meeting his gaze with a challenging stare. There&#39;s a brief moment of tension as they size each other up, the atmosphere crackling with unspoken challenge.

Sogeki&#39;s jaw clenches visibly, his patience wearing thin at the dismissive attitude. <font color = white>&#34;You think you can disrespect what I&#39;ve set up?&#34;</font> His tone is firm, emphasizing his displeasure. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve got guts to say that to my face.&#34;</font>

His voice carries a quiet intensity, daring the stern boy to either stand by his words or face the consequences of his disrespect towards Sogeki&#39;s efforts.<br>(Satetsu, Sogeki)</font></font></font>

Electric as it was, Asa wasn&#39;t one to be easily intimidated. As he listened, his mouth broke into a toothy grin.

<font color = white>&#34;What? Is your ego so fragile that words hurt it?&#34;</font> He said with his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Of course I have the guts to say it to your face. I&#39;m right here saying it, after all. If you were even the slightest bit competent, you wouldn&#39;t allow the contestants to back out.&#34;</font> The aura between them was electric and it was clear their egos were clashing.

Despite his irritation, Sogeki admires the audacity of someone willing to confront him head-on.

<font color = white>&#34;Words don&#39;t hurt me, Asa,&#34;</font> Sogeki retorts with a smirk, his voice steady and confident. <font color = white>&#34;But disrespect gets noticed. If you think I&#39;m incompetent, then show me in the tournament. That&#39;s where it counts.&#34;</font>

He steps closer, the tension palpable between them as their egos clash in the arena of words. <font color = white>&#34;You speak your mind, I get it,&#34;</font> Sogeki continues, his tone firm. <font color = white>&#34;But speaking and proving are two different things. You want to checkmate? You better make sure you can back it up.&#34;</font>

Sogeki&#39;s eyes gleam with a challenge as he meets Asa&#39;s gaze squarely, neither backing down nor conceding ground. The air crackles with rivalry, each asserting their stance with unwavering determination.<br>(Satetsu, Sogeki)</font></font></font>

I have no intention to challenge your perspective.&#34;</font> 

He began walking past the boy, to the sound of the bells. <font color = white>&#34;However, know this. I strive to be the best. Whether I win or lose, it only strengthens my resolve. So, in the end, I still win.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;If my desire for those around me to do better comes off as disrespectful, let it...&#34;</font>

With that, he was off.</font></font></font>

Asa's challenge lingers in the air, and Sogeki silently acknowledges the seriousness of his resolve. He watches Asa depart, the sound of bells fading into the distance.

With a determined expression, Sogeki shifts his focus back to his own preparations for the tournament, his mind already planning his strategies and tactics.

As his eyes scanned the blonde girl, he got a very uneasy feeling. He decided to take a defensive stance, just in case.

<font color = white>&#34;What the hell?&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Get back everyone.&#34;</font>

Seeing His partner go on the offensive he would do the same. Watching to make sure the students did not do anything risky he would prepare to use a jutus on the enemy if he moved to attack the students.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki 's eyes narrowed as he took in the scene before him. The strange scientist with his unsettling presence and the scattered headbands spoke of a dangerous situation. His mind raced, assessing the potential threat and calculating his next move. Despite the scientist's eerie demeanor and the implied threat, Sogeki's stance remained firm and his expression unreadable, masking any fear or concern beneath a veneer of cold resolve.

He knew that action would be required, but for now, Sogeki chose to observe, gathering crucial information and waiting for the right moment to strike. His hand subtly moved towards a concealed weapon, prepared for any sudden developments. In the face of uncertainty and danger, Sogeki's instincts honed in, ready to protect himself and his comrades from whatever this mysterious threat might bring.</font></font></font>

There was a disturbing aura about him, a level of psychosis that was palpable and chilling.



     As a nervous tick, she ran her fingers through her golden locks while her gaze never wavered  as she regarded the bizarre individual who had just issued a dire warning.



<font color = white>&#34;So, let me get this straight,&#34;</font> she began, her tone laced with sarcasm and a hint of defiance. <font color = white>&#34;If we venture into the wilderness, you&#39;re planning to abduct us and transform us into some sort of grotesque and depraved creature such as yourself? Is that what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</font>

She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper,  ashs he  mockingly stated. <font color = white>&#34;Because if that&#39;s your idea of a threat, you might want to reconsider your approach.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

What seemed to be skin and bone was flipping and turning, to reveal a number of mechanisms. His back and arms twist and fold, and his body launches to the side with a number of mechanical creaks.

His head twists around in a three-hundred and sixty degree spiral before it swivels to face the two true Jonin. The body pieces separate and folding, allowing him to immediately slip out of the grasp of the incoming tackle.

<font color = white>&#34;We seek information, but not at the cost of warning. I’ve not come to attack, today, I’m nothing more than an embassy for words today&#34;</font>

The water off to the side begins to ripple, only noticeable by those with attuned senses or abilities such as a Byakugan. While another presence couldn’t be seen though, it could be felt. A chakra system very vaguely seen, almost as if invisible but not.

<font color = white>&#34;Power doesn’t lie in your village, it lies with us. Keep this...&#34;</font> he glances to the two Jonin, <font color = white>&#34;in mind, kids.&#34;</font> He begins to pull off, backing up from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;I bring your missing headbands as a gesture. Now, assuming you want to keep them and your lives, I think I’ll be going...&#34;</font> his beady, glass eyes, looking back and forth between the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;And if not, then we could all just...<b><i>go</b></i>&#34;</font> he begins to launch manically as he cast his eyes down to the bridge.

A bridge lined up with hundreds of explosive tags. <font color = white>&#34;If you catch my drift&#34;</font> one of the eyes winks. <font color = white>&#34;But you won’t have time to battle me and save them&#34;</font> A hand begins to form into a symbol, priming the tags but not setting them off.with only a matter of seconds at hand, would the perpetrator find battle? Or would the kids find rescue?</font></font></font>

Blinked a few times and quickly realized she was in a situaiton way above her pay grade.

He felt an ominous presence but couldn&#39;t quite make it out. As one of the scientist&#39;s hands began forming a symbol, his heart dropped. For a split second, he felt frozen before his adrenaline dumped. <font color = white>&#34;We need to GO!&#34;</font> he said, trying to stir the others to action.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki &#39;s eyes widen as he surveys the situation unfolding before him—the strange scientist transforming into a mechanical marvel, the imminent threat of explosive tags, and the urgency of the moment. His instincts kick in sharply. With a quick assessment of the surroundings and the looming danger, he darts to the side, his movements swift and agile as he attempts to evade the potential blast radius.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</font> Sogeki mutters under his breath, adrenaline coursing through him. He doesn&#39;t engage with the scientist directly, realizing the immediate need to prioritize the safety of himself and the others. His mind races with thoughts of escape routes and strategies to mitigate the imminent threat without escalating the situation further.

As he moves swiftly away from the danger zone, Sogeki&#39;s gaze flickers back towards the scientist and the assembled Jonin. His expression is a mix of frustration and determination, knowing that the situation has escalated beyond a mere confrontation. With a resolve to regroup and strategize further, he gestures urgently for the others to follow suit, seeking cover and safety from the unfolding chaos.</font></font></font>

The Hyuuga was a proud man, believing himself to be the strongest- but he was not foolhardy enough to assume he could both protect and attack at the same time.

In times like this, Matsu knew he could rely on the blessed vessel of the tailed beast. He relinquished all thought of defence and went on an immediate offence. He landing with a heavy thud, poised to attack.

A fraction of a second passed.

A large circle seemed to appear below him and the soon-to-be corpse. Before that very same second ended, Matsu had began a flurry of blows.

<font color = white>&#34;Juukenho!&#34;</font> He shouted, as he delivered two blows. Immediately he delivered 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64 blows! <font color = white>&#34;Hakka Hyaku Bijuhanaho!&#34;</font>
