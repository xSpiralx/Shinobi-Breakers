     <font color = white>&#34;Um, why you all alone? You don&#39;t like to fish either, huh?&#34;</font>

Taking a seat on the bench she slumps forward her shoulders humped as she kicks her feet under the bench- back and forth, back and forth.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa8c5a>Higen currently rests atop the bench, crouched on both tips of his feet. His arms hang loose between his legs whilst his eyes seem to stare off at something in particular.
His gaze swivels up, down in sporatic movements, trailing the movements of something in the short distance.

Only when she sits down his attention shift, <font color = white>&#34;Huh? I&#39;unno. I&#39;m busy, who&#39;re you?&#34;</font>
He quirks a brow, remembering what he was staring at before snapping his attention back to, should she notice, the small butterfly fluttering in the distance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#d6d689><a href=?src=[0x3000034];action=name;character=e82521989c91a4e54dd38a965f17a9ef12d8603bf604ee6dc18be14fe9f008a5 style = "text-decoration: none; color: #d6d689;">The bespectacled girl</a> turned her head to the side watching where his gaze had turned back to, her eyes narrow under the rims of her glasses. It wasn&#39;t my sight that she could tell what he was looking at though. She herself being rather nearsighted.
     <font color = white>&#34;Umm, uou don&#39;t look busy.&#34;</font>

The girl finally closed her eyes and took a deep breath, once in, and then out before nodding.
      <font color = white>&#34;I can hear them before I see them, most things are like that for me. And um, I&#39;m uh... Miyu.&#34;</font>

Head turned she continued to listen to the butterfly in the distance, before adding.
      <font color = white>&#34;Um, who&#39;re you? Since you asked me and, yeah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa8c5a>Higen &#39;s focus is expressed when he bites his tongue on the corner of his lips, like a tiger preparing to pounce. His feet swivel and plant themselves on the bench and his hands grip at the edge.
<font color = white>&#34;Shh, shh, shh..&#34;</font> he mutters.

Once the butterfly approaches, the lad leaps and attempts to clamp his hands around the small creature.
He lands on his face.
She&#39;d hear the winged beauty hovering over him without care. An obvious miss.

<font color = white>&#34;Gaaaah! I&#39;ll get it..&#34;</font>
He turns to lay flat on his back, sprawling his arms open at each side. His head rises to look over at Miyu, <font color = white>&#34;Higen. Got somethin&#39; in your eyes?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#d6d689><a href=?src=[0x3000034];action=name;character=e82521989c91a4e54dd38a965f17a9ef12d8603bf604ee6dc18be14fe9f008a5 style = "text-decoration: none; color: #d6d689;">The bespectacled girl</a> confusion had replaced the quiet contemplation she had been sitting and listening in just a moment before. The sound of him landing on his face was enough to make her gasp a bit. 

Hands clenched the bench on either side of her and she quickly shook her hed, causing her glasses to slide down her nose.
       <font color = white>&#34;Uh, nothing is in my eyes, thanks for asking though. Higen... that&#39;s a uh, a nice name.&#34;</font>

Head turning to the side not unlike how animals look at their owners she asked.
        &#34;Um, what are you doing? Are you trying to catch it? And um, why?</font></font></font>

His arms cross, returning the confused stare.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t you?&#34;</font>
As though such a question had a more than obvious answer.</font></font></font>

    <font color = white>&#34;Uh, I think I&#39;d be worried I&#39;d hurt it&#39;s wings in my want to hold on to it.&#34;</font>

A low humm was given after that as the obvious thoughts continued.
      <font color = white>&#34;But um, I see why you&#39;d want to, I guess.&#34;</font>

Her eyes seemed to rest on the arms crossed on his chest.
      <font color = white>&#34;Are you upset?&#34;</font>

The question was asked and then followed quickly by another question.
      <font color = white>&#34;Do you live here or are you just here to become a Shinobi or both?&#34;</font>
Her hands stay gripped on either side of her on the bench, as her feet continue to kick back and forth, back and forth.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa8c5a>Higen &#39;s eyes seemed to stare through her, as though he was looking toward a different view of what he believed to see.
A starry-eye&#39;d stare is coupled with a few words.
     <font color = white>&#34;I want to become a shinobi.&#34;</font>

Steps guide him toward the bench, plating himself at her side for the time being. His legs mimick her own.
<font color = white>&#34;You want to be strong, too?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

      <font color = white>&#34;Um, I want to help others who are strong or, something like that, uh yeah.&#34;</font>

Her gaze turns up towards the and she chuckles a little.
     <font color = white>&#34;I can&#39;t even fish though. I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s um, going to work out.&#34;</font>

The laugh becomes a sigh and she shrugs.
     <font color = white>&#34;Um, I just want to do something more... I guess.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa8c5a>Higen leaps from where he sat, chucking a single fist skyward, <font color = white>&#34;Fishing doesn&#39;t take any skill! Ya&#39; wanna&#39; do something more huh? Well, just do it! Not &#39;cause they tell you to, but &#39;cause you wanna&#39;!&#34;</font>

    <font color = white>&#34;Uh, I want to do something splendid, something heroic, or um- wonderful, that won’t be forgotten after I’m dead. I don’t know what, but I’m on the watch for it, and mean to astonish even myself.&#34;</font>

It was said matter-of-factly with another nod at the end of it.</font></font></font>
