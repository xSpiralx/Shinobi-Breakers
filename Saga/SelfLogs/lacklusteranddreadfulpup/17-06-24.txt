And now, with nowhere to flee, and no one to call upon, she saw herself in a big dilemma. Her eyes shut tightly, praying for assistance, but alas, none would come. She could only rely on herself and her own ability.
 <font color = white>&#34;I said... Get off me!&#34;</font> she screamed.

In a fury of emotions, she aimed to wrench her arms away from his hold, using every ounce of strength within her. As desperation fueled her actions, she swung her head forward, intending to collide their foreheads. The impact, though painful, created just enough distance between them. She staggered back, her breath ragged, eyes burning with defiance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966><a href=?src=[0x3000054];action=name;character=c9469f8b5fe4a2fa25b7e618726c03452531c282d115d7943170852e86306377 style = "text-decoration: none; color: #009966;">The heavy breathing kid</a> would hear a loud bang.. Chonamu&#39;s heavy breathing would stop <font color = white>&#34;Hey ..You two stop goofing off something is happening.&#34;</font>

The cubby kid dashes off to go see what all the commition was about.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji finds an increasingly amusing feeling surfacing from within. The inexplainable sensation thriving when face to face with the girl having realized she bit off more than she could currently chew. It didn&#39;t make him feel strong, no, he always knew boys were just better than girls at things like fighting.

But maybe it was just seeing her eat her words? That was possibly the reason he felt so pleased with the current situation. Of course it doesn&#39;t stay that way as while the dark haired, onyx eyed girl is attempting to wrestle her hand free, he is unaware of her second method. 

He crumples under the pressure of a forehead. <font color = white>&#34;You---! Fat headed, wide forehead! Aaaugh, did you break my skull!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>
On the contrary, Suzaku was desperately trying to overcome her fear of physical confrontation with a kid. To her fortune and surprise, their heads collided with a resounding thud, sending a sharp pain through her skull and knocking her off her feet and onto her backside.

She rubbed the point of impact, the pain a stark reminder to avoid such interactions unless absolutely necessary. Tears welled in the corners of her eyes, and with reddened cheeks puffed in indignation, she pointed an accusing finger at the beige-haired youth.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to touch me, you idiot!&#34;</font> she shouted, her voice trembling with anger. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m just a fragile little girl. It&#39;s not like I could hurt you, even if I tried!&#34;</font>

She sniffled, raising her hands to her eyes to catch the tears before they could fall and reveal her vulnerability. Then, she paused, her lips curving into a defiant smirk. Despite her display of weakness, she refused to concede defeat. <font color = white>&#34;Staying true to your kind, huh? Only a beast resorts to violence!&#34;</font><br>(<a href=?src=[0x3000054];action=name;character=f15009ebe9454c1ea024189103fc2ca7763b242901d21d706f386f4e213f5c0b style = "text-decoration: none; color: #9970c1;">The onyx-eyed girl</a>)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9e633c>Sakujak, Kaji grumbles and groans as silently and dignified as he can, the point where they&#39;d connected still stinging with a sharp twinge every now and then. As much as his eyes watered, he glared at the now fallen dark aesthetic girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;There was no way I was going to let you get away with scrunching up my shirt just because your ego wouldn&#39;t let you be called &#39;ugly&#39;!&#34;</font> And look, look at what became of them because of her bruised pride. Her unwillingness to let it go. They both were now on their butts and in pain.

He&#39;ll return the finger, pointing at her. <font color = white>&#34;Your head is as solid as a rock, don&#39;t give me the fragile excuse! Besides, look, you&#39;re still calling me a beast. Nnngh, just who do you think you are, huh!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
