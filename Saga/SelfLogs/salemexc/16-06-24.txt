<font color = white>&#34;During my days Akihabara was a more lively place to live in.. what have the youth done to my village..&#34;</font> he sighs as he complains about the youth like any respectable old man would do.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji turns toward the direction of the old man, scoffing in his direction.

<font color = white>&#34;Give it time, old fart. Akihabara will flourish soon.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Unfortunately. the old man could neither see or hear well, barely registering the merchant&#39;s appearance as something blurry.. while completely misunderstanding his words..

<font color = white>&#34;Give me fart, Akihabara flour soup..? Tsk tsk..&#34;</font> he repeats, before shaking his head in disappointment <font color = white>&#34;Fart this, fart that.. kids these days..Your sales pitch is weak lad. You need to work on that!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji waves off the elder, a disinterested look visible on his face. He returns checking his inventory, a moment passes before he speaks.

<font color = white>&#34;Akihabara may have fallen on hard times, but we&#39;ll return to that golden age of prosperity.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Though what little he had heard made him nod approvingly.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s right lad! You are a smart cookie, you&#39;ll go far.&#34;</font> he squints in an attempt to see the merchant&#39;s face, only to be met by the harsh reality that was his failing sight <font color = white>&#34;I am sure you already know, but if you don&#39;t, then let this old man give you some information.&#34;</font> he coughs, clearing his throat <font color = white>&#34;Rain and Rocks are the future of commerce! Keep an eye out on those two villages.. in a year or two they will become a good source of business.&#34;</font>

While his words were fancy, the content was... common knowledge. <font color = white>&#34;Now.. this old man will leave to your job.&#34;</font> he moves away, walking as slowly as one would expect form the elderly</font></font></font>

       <font color = white>&#34;...this is one of my favorite songs.&#34;</font> 
                    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4z5kntXAA] 

With a soft expression, the musician closes her eyes and places her soft lips upon the flute. As she exhales, a melody dances from the instrument, filling the air with light, metaphorical music notes.

<font color = white>&#34;Beautiful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
