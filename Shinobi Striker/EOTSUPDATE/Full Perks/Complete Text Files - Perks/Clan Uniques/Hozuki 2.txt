Hydration Master: 
The Hozuki clan of Kirigakure are famed for hydration abilities.  This individual has advanced to such a degree of mastery that they are able to utilize advanced hydrative techniques, and convert their bodies for longer durations.  This enables the usage of Water Gun, and Drowning Water Blob.
Note: MAXIMUM: SIX ROUNDS.

 


Demon Fish: 
This individual is uniquely skilled in the mastery of the hydrification technique.  They are capable of merging with large bodies of water, and collecting it into their own bodies - both extending their reach, size and strength.  This allows the use of techniques similar to the Demon Blob, used by Suigetsu versus the Eight Tails.
