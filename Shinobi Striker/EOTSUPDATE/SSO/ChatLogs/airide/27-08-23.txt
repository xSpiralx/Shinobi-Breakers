<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: What else can you give besides a n- Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: They'll give you a nickname!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: What's more than a name huh.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) instictively rushed to Sakuya's defense and took the brunt of the blow!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) As the white-haired dancer swings at her, Sakuya quickly parries the punch with her arm. Seizing the moment, she throws a punch right back, aiming for the dancer&#39;s midsection...Is what she would have done but her cousin saved her oddly.

<font color = white>&#34;Rather rude of you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between the two Senjus and white haired dancer. Was this an altercation brewing in real time. Perhaps something needed to be done to calm the tensions.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys, umm, how about we all just take a moment to cool off? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) crushed through the youngster&#39;s defenses, but found herself parried off-- Or something.

Someone got hit for the shit talking, so she let it be for now with scowling, red eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one calling people names.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighed and shook her head, <font color = white>&#34;I thought you guys were just being friendly. What do we actually call you then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: Is this not for the enrollments?
<br><font color=red>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) increases their health by Heavy Damage - 5.96 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Kamiya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) nervously watched the few bicker amongst themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...&#34;</font> is all he could manage to get out, deciding to not get in the middle of things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A pleasure to meet you Kamiya!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Swallowing her pride, she steps forward with her hand extended in a gesture of apology.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</font> she says sincerely, looking into the dancer&#39;s eyes. <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to offend you. If I&#39;ve said or done something to upset you, I apologize.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am not sure what I said as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gsaze as he never exactly got his question answered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Pfew. Glad that&#39;s sorted out. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) yawned, what a morning it had been already, just idly passing the time. She would just glance over to the girl next to her briefly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. We haven&#39;t spoken before but since we&#39;re standing here. I&#39;m Okiku.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) glad the fighting stopped. She would've just kept taking punches for either student until she passed out. Crisis averted.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sorry my cousin is aloof as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) squinted between them, obviously suspicious of the apology and pleasant greetings. Darting eyes warily regarded the hand gesture. This was the second weirdo to say something and then pretend they didn&#39;t know it&#39;d be a problem. Shoulders roll, dislocating and then -popping- back into place as she maintained her expression, despite the pain that should have caused.

<font color = white>&#34;... fine.&#34;</font> She mumbled, carefully taking her hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (was glad*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;That was rather... Keep doing that and you&#39;re going to have arthritis soon,&#34;</font> she says, pointing meaningfully at the girl&#39;s shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Teach me how to roll my shoulder like that!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks over at the shoulder dislocating like that.

<font color = white>&#34;That looked painful. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: You should get that checked out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) released the other girl&#39;s hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to teach. Just do it.&#34;</font> She replied, ignoring the cautions against arthritis. <font color = white>&#34;Of course it was painful.&#34;</font> She replied, wondering how it could not be-- or why anyone would do it if it wasn&#39;t. Dislocation could be useful for escaping binds, though...

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can ger arthiritis.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: get*
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Can you dislocate anything else?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I see this is today's new hangout.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: This will be my everyday hang out!
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) increases their health by Full - 6 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) yells: Mind if I see!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: At least you'll be easy to find, Shishorama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) held a hand out and bent her index finger nearly all the way back, until it was curling backwards. This was less of a dislocation and more of a hypermobility, though-- but which kid would even care? There's a slight shift in expression, suggesting this was somehow more painful than the shoulder roll.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) widened her eyes at Kamiya&#39;s finger. What the heck is even that?! <font color = white>&#34;Oh my goodness! Your finger is <b>BROKEN</b>!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Nope, the bones are just fine.
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: ...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya watches with a mixture of fascination and curiosity as the white-haired dancer flexes her index finger backward in an extreme display of hypermobility. For a moment, Sakuya thinks she can detect a wince in the dancer&#39;s eyes, a subtle hint that this unusual flexibility comes at a cost.

Intrigued, a thought crosses Sakuya&#39;s mind: this girl might be just as eccentric as she is. Feeling a newfound sense of kinship, she can&#39;t help but feel that a friendship between them could be equally intriguing and enriching.

Taking a step closer, Sakuya smiles and extends her hand in a friendly gesture. <font color = white>&#34;You know, we might have more in common than we thought. Would you like to be friends? I&#39;m Sakuya, by the way. Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would dead pan and turn towards Shishorama.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s a Kaguya- Like the Hokage.&#34;</font> Hoping this would shed some light on their abilities in some compacity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s jaw dropped as he saw Kamiya&#39;s finger.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s...scary to see. Also anyone else started to feel pain in their fingers after seeing that? No, just me? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*she's)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I think he is a she.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [oh man ur lucky u fixed that]
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: So it was an over reaction?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Who cares that she's a Kaguya?! She just broke- twisted her finger!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Do we have a medic-nin nearby?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) let her finger snap back. <font color = white>&#34;Sure, Sakuy--&#34;</font> Kamiya stopped mid sentence, certain she had heard another unlucky soul who wanted to receive a punch. The feeling vanished after a moment. Her finger is held with her other hand, and its discolored, now-- significantly redder than the others, a little swollen. It was hardly a free action as evidenced by this cost.

<font color = white>&#34;It hurts, but it isn&#39;t broken.&#34;</font> She said, to the intense youngster. <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t break my bones.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) gave a long stare- A long confused, judgemental stare before mentally facepalming.

<font color = white>&#34;Her abilities are probably like Lord Hokage, a Kaguya... They manipulate bone.&#34;</font> A smirk came to his face, he found it funny people hadn&#39;t heard stories of the Leader of the Village. Though on a second glance... They could manipulate Bones... but the fleshy parts were still damaged.

<font color = white>&#34;Though, youf pain tolerance must be insane since you damage the flashy bits...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*your Typo 2/2 may as well aim for the moon in typos.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Can Kamiya manipulate my bones too?
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks:  You realized if they're okay then you shouldn't over react, right?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I would assume so.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (question, Kamiya
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (does Kamiya resemble a male?)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) grinned at the Uchiha on the end of the line. She approached the boy, and held  her swollen index finger out. There&#39;s a look of incredible focus. She grunted, and huffed, and puffed, the obvious spice of pain in her inflection as a -hole- began to open at the end of her finger, and a pure, white finger bone began to poke out. It&#39;s clear this is taking an exhaustive amount of effort as her entire body is shaking.

It was revolting; unsettling.

<font color = white>&#34;Pull my finger.&#34;</font> Urged a strained voice.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [yes]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [the other 11 year old kaguya]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (Kami M and Kami F.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I have a question before I pull your finger!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Are you a male or female? I'm not sure what to call you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) couldn&#39;t tell if she was talking to him or to the sable-haired youth next to him. Either way the request was rather weird. Kamiya wanted her finger to be pulled, while it seemed the bone was starting to protrude through the actual finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would blink for a moment, though in his morbid curiousity he&#39;d absolutely do so. He wondered if that bone was in-fact coming out of that gory hole Kamiya&#39;s body seem to make. The Uchiha heard stories of the bones tearing through skin of both user and foe, this was far more clean than anticipated. However there was a strangeness to it when seeing something like this first hand.

The weird part was seeing how white the bone was despite it travelling through fleshm he expected them stained red, really.

<font color = white>&#34;Gnarly.&#34;</font> It was the only wword he could think of while doing this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clenched her jaw as he pulled an entire digit out. The hole closed, and rather than some gelatenous, boneless finger like one woudl expect, Kamiya seemed no worse for wear than before. There wasn&#39;t even a sign that she&#39;d just opened and inch wide hole in her flesh. The pain was real, but there were not lasting effects. 

She took the finger from him and wagged it in his face, the digit bouncing and bending at each knuckle. 

<font color = white>&#34;And now I can use this like a dagger!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) carefully observed the whole thing. The word &#39;gnarly&#39; described it well. But the boy got so invested into the process that he could see every little detail. And this, well, this had undesired results.

Dark haired boy immediately covered his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh I think I&#39;m gonna be sick. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: ---
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: She just -- pulled the -- bone out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the finger, dumbfounded. She thought she&#39;d seen a lot in her twelve years of life, but that was absolutely <i>disgusting</i>. Never wanting to witness that again, she persists in asking Kamiya the question that bothered her so greatly.

<font color = white>&#34;So....are you a male or female...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly wheeled around, slashing the intense youngster with her abnormally sharp finger bone.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you stupid?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Well, no...maybe..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wasn&#39;t sure if he should find this cool, scary, concerning, or morbid. He proceeded to mentally choose all of the above.

<font color = white>&#34;Eeeehww, but awesome. That&#39;s taking &#39;pointer finger&#39; very literally.&#34;</font> Making fun of the situation rather than keeling over sick, though he really had no idea how to react and fell back on humour as a coping mechanism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the they/them, unphased. <font color = white>&#34;I just can&#39;t tell, okay?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: It's really obvious I'm a girl, you weirdo.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: O-Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Right!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Because the voice!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...And the hair...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: R-Right!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: And the pretty face? 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The other Kami is a guy.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: And the unearthjly grace?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Well, you certainly have unearthly grace!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Yeah that last one...oh never mind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) loomed.

<font color = white>&#34;Right?&#34;</font> She whispered, dangerously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Don't all Kaguya have the poise?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) leaned closer to Kamiya with a quirked eyebrow, <font color = white>&#34;Why are we whispering?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Ei!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) makes a small yelp in surprise. She wasn&#39;t easily intimidated, but Kamiya was getting there. <font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you poking me with that!? It came from inside you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) covers his mouth again as she poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Pointer Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sticky Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: It's not my fault that I couldn't tell what you were! You didn't ask to be born like that!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I feel a punch coming.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I have a feeling it'd be more like a puncture wound.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly whipped the finger toward the wall, letting it smash against it into bits and pieces.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re pretty stupid. You&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t beat up special needs children.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: So the bones can break...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: That is a good one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) frowned a bit at the Kaguya&#39;s remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey hey, no need to call names. We&#39;re all friends here. Right? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighs and relaxes as the tension in her body dies down. She was expecting a punch or stab, but it never came. <font color = white>&#34;Phew...that was close. - I wonder when the classes are going to start.&#34;</font> She says, looking off into the distance. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Laro(The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) OOCs: ( hmm so are apps closed? )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Anri(The dead eyed teen-Airide) OOCs: (For?)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Could have ended badly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Laro(The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) OOCs: ( clans )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Anri(The dead eyed teen-Airide) OOCs: (Good question iunno)
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I like bad ends.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: It's the best when the villain wins.
