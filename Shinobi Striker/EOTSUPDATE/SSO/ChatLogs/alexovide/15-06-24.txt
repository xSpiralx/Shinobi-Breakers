<br><font color=green>*Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Yes, I would believe there should be one explaining the future of the village.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Ah, that one.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (sorry, nearly done with this code.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) entered the bustling courtyard of the Ninja Academy of Amegakure, his tall figure draped in a dark cloak that contrasted sharply with the vibrant uniforms of the students. His demeanor exuded a controlled aggression, evident in the furrowed brows and the smug curl of his lips. Beside him walked Kryu, another figure clad in standard shinobi attire, blending into the background of the bustling academy scene.

As they moved among the academy students engaged in training, Sogeki's piercing gaze swept over them in a swift, calculated manner. Each glance was brief yet impactful, leaving an unmistakable impression of authority and power. Kryu, a mere silhouette beside Sogeki, mirrored his intensity with a quiet determination, contributing to the palpable tension in the air.

The students, accustomed to rigorous training and the presence of senior instructors, couldn't help but feel the weight of Sogeki and Kryu's presence. Some straightened instinctively under their scrutiny, while others exchanged nervous looks. Their silent observation seemed to cast a shadow over the courtyard, a reminder of the harsh realities of ninja life.

Amidst the training exercises and the senior instructor's commands, Sogeki and the shadowy figure of Kryu remained a focal point, their quiet yet formidable presence leaving an indelible mark on the young aspiring shinobi of Amegakure. Together, they embodied a potent combination of controlled aggression and disciplined resolve, setting a standard that few dared to challenge.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) smirked.

<font color = white>&#34;Got it.&#34;</font>
His finger finally landing a grappled connection with the booger. Then retreating from his nostril and removing it from the deep corner it was lodged in.

Flicking it off his finger in the direction of the two behind him without knowing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: Was bigger than I thought.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked; she didn&#39;t move nor did she react in any method. The young one was more then capable of raising his brow as he stared, and slowly her hands eased back behind her back. 

A softly tsk formed from her lips; the young looking yer older dark-skinned young woman appeared out of place. Her attire an oddity, and yet she adorned a massive assortment of weapons upon her frame. 

The most outstandish being a rather hefty looking ornate looking blade attached to her hip. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm...,&#34;</font>

Her eyes shifted, and she peered forth upon those around her - she held back for now on how she wished to speak. She was a vice, a woman of cold, and blunt nature yet she carried herself with the mannerisms of experience and aggressive training. 

A twist of her frame, agile, and daft while she turned to stare at everyone with a mere spin before she finally took a step forward, and shifted her back away from those within the area. 

She simply stared. She wanted to know who was speaking, so that she may hopefully avoid having to deal with such things. She hated long talks, and honestly hated most people. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I would advise against such outlandish and potentially harmful aspects.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Should one find reasons, many of which find reasons for no purpose they might just end up attacking you for flicking that about.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It would ruin my fun if you got hurt over such childish reasons.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) observes the interaction silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) After a minute or so of silent observation, Sogeki realized that this courtyard wasn&#39;t the one designated for the combat trials. Annoyance etched deeper lines onto his visage, furrowing his brows and tightening his lips into a displeased frown. His icy gaze swept across the surroundings with a hint of frustration, silently criticizing himself for the oversight.

The revelation disrupted the atmosphere of controlled tension he had cultivated, causing a momentary ripple of confusion among the academy students who had felt his intimidating presence. Finally breaking his silence, Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd.

<font color = white>&#34;Where&#39;s the fight happening?&#34;</font> His tone was clipped and assertive, demanding immediate clarity amidst the unexpected setback. The question hung in the air, drawing all eyes to him briefly before a senior instructor stepped forward to redirect everyone to the correct location.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) extends his left pinky out and then raises it. Moving it right to his ear and then beginning to dig inside of it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: Ah nice nice. Nothing beats digging out built up wax.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) drifts his gaze the crowd. As the various people he'd likely come to know as peers conversed and interacted there's a certain voice that cuts through the chatter. Sliding his gaze long the faceless mass it eventually falls on Sogeki.

The remnants of his question linger in the air for a moment and in response he simply blinks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) noticed the grandson of a revered hero actively ignoring him, which sparked a wave of frustration within him. How dare anyone dismiss him in such a manner? His annoyance turned to indignation as he locked his gaze on the white-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, you better clean out those crusted ears! I know you heard me, nerd!&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice carried across the courtyard, sharp with irritation. His words were a challenge, laced with authority and demanding respect. <font color = white>&#34;Where&#39;s the fight happening!?&#34;</font> He emphasized each word, his tone leaving no room for disobedience or evasion.

The students nearby glanced nervously between Sogeki and the white-haired boy, sensing the tension crackling in the air. The grandson of the hero hesitated for a moment, visibly caught off guard by Sogeki&#39;s direct approach. Before he could respond, a senior instructor intervened swiftly, redirecting attention to the correct location of the combat trials.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm, maybe all of you won't die after all.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t apologize to me, cabbage boy!&#34;</font> Sogeki huffed out a sigh, his demeanor casual despite the lingering scent. He shrugged indifferently. <font color = white>&#34;Not like you can help it. Ain&#39;t no big deal.&#34;</font>

His words carried a hint of understanding, acknowledging that personal circumstances often influenced such details. Despite his initial reaction, Sogeki&#39;s demeanor remained relaxed, showing a pragmatic acceptance of the situation.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki methodically paces towards Higane, the air thickens with oppressive tension. His every step echoes with quiet menace, each footfall calculated and deliberate. The onlookers, usually boisterous and lively, fall into an uneasy silence as they witness the unfolding scene.

Sogeki's demeanor is chillingly calm, his eyes narrowed into icy slits that seem to pierce through the very soul of anyone who dares to meet his gaze. His presence exudes an aura of impending danger, like a predator stalking its prey with unwavering focus.

The sound of his footsteps reverberates ominously in the arena, setting off a cascade of nervous whispers among the spectators. Some shift uncomfortably, their instincts screaming at them to flee from the palpable threat emanating from Sogeki.

Higane, standing firm in the face of this approaching storm, can feel the weight of Sogeki's gaze bearing down on him like a heavy yoke. A cold sweat breaks out on his brow as he realizes the magnitude of the challenge before him.

With each passing moment, Sogeki closes the distance with a deliberate slowness that only heightens the tension in the air. His movements are fluid yet controlled, like a coiled serpent ready to strike at any moment.

Finally, he stands mere paces away from Higane. Sogeki's lips curl into a menacing smirk, devoid of warmth, a harbinger of impending turmoil and ruthless determination.

The arena falls into an eerie silence, anticipation hanging thick in the air like a suffocating fog. All eyes are fixed on Sogeki and Higane, two forces on a collision course destined to unleash chaos and turmoil upon the arena floor.</font></font></font>

He pivots smoothly, evading Higane&#39;s makeshift senbon with a sidestep that seems almost effortless. The wooden needles whistle past him harmlessly, grazing the air where he had stood just moments before.

A dark glint flashes in Sogeki&#39;s eyes as he retrieves a pair of wooden kunai from his own kit with a fluid motion. His expression remains stoic, but a simmering intensity radiates from him, an unsettling aura that seems to pulse with anticipation.

He takes a deliberate step forward, closing the distance between them with a predator&#39;s grace. The arena around them seems to hold its breath, the tension thickening with each passing second.

Sogeki moves decisively, launching one of the wooden kunai towards Higane. It cuts through the air with precision, a silent declaration of his intent and skill. The blade&#39;s trajectory is aimed to test her reflexes, a challenge laid down in the quiet confrontation unfolding between them.

<i>Woosh!</i> The kunai whistles past her long black hair as she ducks bellow it, entering a low stance and releasing a new set of senbon at her oponent with a swift step backwards. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. three left.&#34;</font> She mumbled as her fingers fidget with her shinobi kit.

Her determination and adaptability are evident as she enters a low stance, preparing her next move with a swift step backwards. He senses her calculating gaze and the tension in the air thickens as she readies her next set of senbon.

Moving with controlled aggression, Sogeki closes the distance between them with deliberate steps. He weaves and sidesteps, evading the incoming senbon with fluid movements that speak of honed skill and instinct. Each step he takes is purposeful, a silent dance of anticipation and readiness.

His focus remains locked on Higane, studying her movements and adjusting his strategy accordingly. Sogeki doesn&#39;t rush into action just yet, opting instead to observe and assess his opponent&#39;s tactics. His expression is unreadable, a mask of calm amidst the flurry of movement and tension surrounding them.

As Higane mutters to herself about her remaining senbon, Sogeki&#39;s smirk returns briefly, a silent acknowledgment of the challenge she presents. He knows this won&#39;t be an easy match, but that only fuels his determination to prove his strength and skill in the unfolding confrontation.

Her strategy of shoot and evade challenges him to adapt and respond with equal precision. The senbon fly towards him, propelled by her practiced technique, but Sogeki remains calm amidst the storm of needles.

He smirks faintly at her taunt, a glint of amusement dancing in his eyes. His steps are measured and deliberate as he continues to close the distance between them. Evading the projectiles with deft movements, he waits patiently, timing his response with calculated precision.

As the last senbon whizzes past him, Sogeki seizes the moment. With a sudden burst of speed and agility, he launches himself towards Higane. His movements are swift and decisive, closing the gap between them in a heartbeat. His hands blur as he prepares to strike, ready to test her defenses and assert his dominance in the arena.

Small beads of sweat form behind the girls nape.. <font color = white>&#34;Ah shit, last two huh..&#34;</font> She whimpered as she launched her second to last set of senbon at Sogeki.

His tactical adjustment had cost him footing, and in that moment of vulnerability, he saw Higane&#39;s senbon closing in.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn,&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath, his eyes narrowing with determination. Swiftly drawing one of his remaining sets of senbon from his own kit, he thrust them forward in a calculated clash of wood against wood, intercepting Higane&#39;s projectiles with precision.

The clash echoed through the arena, the sound of wood meeting wood reverberating in the tense silence. Sogeki held his ground, his movements deliberate and controlled as he advanced slowly. His focus intensified, a silent determination radiating from him despite the setback.

With each measured step forward, Sogeki recalibrated his strategy. He needed to close the distance effectively, relying on his remaining weaponry and his own skills to turn the tide in his favor. His eyes locked on Higane, calculating his next move as he prepared to engage with renewed resolve.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah!&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted through clenched teeth, feeling the sting of the senbon piercing his flesh. He quickly pulled it out with a swift motion, blood trickling down his arm. Ignoring the pain, he maintained his steady advance towards Higane.

His gaze locked onto her, his expression hardening with determination. The injury fueled his fighting spirit rather than weakening it. With a determined grunt, Sogeki pushed through the discomfort, his movements fluid and focused.

Closing the gap with unwavering resolve, he pressed forward despite the injury, ready to meet Higane&#39;s next move head-on. His mind raced with strategies, adapting to the evolving dynamics of their confrontation. Sogeki knew that every moment counted now, and he was determined to prove his strength and resilience in the face of adversity.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s relentless advance halts abruptly as he sees Higane&#39;s final set of senbon hurtling towards him. His eyes narrow with determination as he prepares to intercept or evade the incoming projectiles. However, just before he can react, Higane&#39;s voice rings out with unexpected intensity, shouting <font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font>

Confusion flickers across Sogeki&#39;s face for a moment. He doesn&#39;t recognize the term or understand its significance, but he senses the conviction in Higane&#39;s voice. Ignoring the unfamiliarity, he refocuses on the immediate threat of the senbon heading his way.

With a swift sidestep and a flick of his wrist, Sogeki manages to deflect some of the senbon, but one grazes his shoulder, drawing a sharp intake of breath from him. He winces at the pain but doesn&#39;t falter. His mind races, recalibrating his approach as he continues his determined advance towards Higane.

His strategy remains unchanged: assert dominance, prove his strength, and seize control of the confrontation. The unfamiliar technique Higane mentioned is momentarily set aside in his mind as he readies himself for the next exchange, focused on the immediate challenge before him.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) Focuses intently upon who he now found to be family. He places hands within his pockets before smirking. He watches his two clansmen spar looking at the form of their Jyuuken as he had yet to really train with the clans Taijutsu style.

'Might as well get a good idea of the foot work...', he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s smile slowly creeps up her face as she snickers outloud.. <font color = white>&#34;Whats wrong?! Not closing in anymore! You&#39;re in range!&#34;</font>

The young girl holds her stance, and remains still. Her resolve steadfast. It could have all ended here.. But Sogeki&#39;s attitude begun to irritate her.. slowly wilting away her patience. <font color = white>&#34;You talk so high and mighty, but you don&#39;t understand what its like to be revered! What it&#39;s truly like to be thought of as an elite...&#34;</font> She stopped herself halfway..

Her teeth audibly grit making a low grinding sound. <font color = white>&#34;The pressure... the damn pressure..&#34;</font> She concluded, as her stance seemed to waiver and almost crumble.. no longer did she look as agile and intimidating.
