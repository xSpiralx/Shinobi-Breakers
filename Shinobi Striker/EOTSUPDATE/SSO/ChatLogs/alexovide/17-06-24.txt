<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) let out a small but audible chuckle as he looked at the unconcious Yuki. Then back towards the profound blonde. His shoulders shifting as he shrugged, beginning to speak.
    <font color = white>&#34;My thoughts exact, I&#39;m glad it was settled though. Y&#39;have fun?&#34;</font>, he muttered. 

His gaze unwavering as if he had front-row seats to a boxing match. Even if in reality, this was a <i>squash match</i>, as they do in wrestling federations. Some form of pity was shared for the cold child. However, it was ultimately shrugged off - the <b>did</b> call his cousin <i>&#39;Sharky&#39;</i> after all. 
              Child or not, that shit won&#39;t chill.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: What do we have here?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Not much, jus' casual night-time scufflin'.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Sounds like fun.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Riiight? That's what I said.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) arrives from deeper into the village, whistling as she arrives at the restored bridge. <font color = white>&#34;Oh neat, it&#39;s actually fixed, love that.&#34;</font> She commented, as her gaze scrutinized the nearby individuals.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Fun..?&#34;</font>

She pauses, her pointing finger instead coming up to her cheek where she lightly taps. There wasn&#39;t any particular word for what she felt doing that. &#39;Fun&#39; almost felt too simple. Anything extra would be doing too much. Unable to come up with a solution, she merely shrugged in response.

     <font color = white>&#34;I guess. He&#39;d just better watch his mouth next time...&#34;</font> she grumbles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I just hope he isn't one of those guys to try again and again..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Hey Afro, whats inside that weird backpack you got..
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Maybe we should find out...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) yawns a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I hope I find a teacher some day.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I think I'm ready to learn some good things.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) paused for a moment before he moved his hand from his side towards his chin then speaking up, once again. 
    <font color = white>&#34;I feel he may be th&#39;type. Though, y&#39;can&#39;t help it I guess. Jus&#39; hope they don&#39;t try to jump you. Then again - I could join fighting &#39;em at that point.&#34;</font>, he spoke, beginning to chuckle a bit.

Fun via combat was something that didn&#39;t <i>fancy</i> him per se. But there wwas definitely monetary value when it comes to <b>combat</b> and the likes. Something this kid had an eye for.
    <font color = white>&#34;Then again, y&#39;seem strong enough to take on most on yer own, so there may be no need for that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Someone got attacked..? Man, I go pray at the shrine for a day and so much happens.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) continues to oogle over the Uzumaki's strange back adornment...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) turned around, <font color = white>&#34;Um.... nothing really just some clothes for me to shift between but doesn&#39;t your eyes reveal things like that&#34;</font>.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh..? It's just a weird shape.. And no, silly! I don't walk just casually peek at people with my eyes, plus that is not how it works.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) taps her chin a few times, while her right foot rhytmically follows.. Deviant cogwheels turning within the young girls mind. <font color = white>&#34;But you know.. I totally could..&#34;</font>

Was she joking? Or was this the start of her peeping era.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) scoffed at the very notion.

     <font color = white>&#34;If <i>it</i> decides <i>it</i> wants to jump me, that&#39;ll be the day I make <i>its</i> face a permanent part of the bridge.&#34;</font> she responds.

Even with that threat and notion, she can&#39;t help but try and shrug it off again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hopefully they just drop the whole thing..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Afro(The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) OOCs: (sorry my girlfriend has me on the phone so it's hard to focus.

<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Oh wow.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmn, yeah, hopefully. They might carry th'grudge, but I doubt they're dumb enough to try this charade again..
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Can I see your weird backpack?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Probably not with me.. but they'll try their luck with the cabbage kid..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Perhaps, perhaps. Maybe they'll have a better chance? Either way, out of our hands. However, I may call it a night.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Yer name was Hana right?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Hrm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) leans in. She brings her hand to the side of her face whilst her voice drops to a mere hush.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Huh. You going to sleep, cousin?
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean, I've been asleep this whole time, so. I can't blame you.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Did I miss anything?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hey excuse me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice before busting out into a fit of laughter. Whilst it may have been quite a small topic to laugh at - it was quite funny to him before he began to speak to his cousin.
     <font color = white>&#34;Nawl, other than some scuffling and such. Was entertaining for the most part. But now it&#39;s my turn to do that standing-and-sleeping routine. Oh, right.&#34;</font>
    After speaking he turned to lean to whisper back, his voice carrying his previous joyful tune. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I need to make 1000 ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Can someone help?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: A job maybe?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Sensei?
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Thats a big number.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Quite.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's like.. Eight or nine construction shifts.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Its not cheap being a shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ..I don't think all of us combined have that kind of cash to throw around.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: What do you need it for? Maybe I can pitch in if its important.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Potentially jutsus and weapons.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: But mainly jutsus probably.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh..yeah, no.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: I was thinking it was something more important! Like medicine or something!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Eh? We're barely learnin' th'basics and y'want that much for th'advanced shit.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yeah, same.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Jutsu? Kehehahah! Hahahah. Hah. Hah. Hah.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Sorry, no.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Anyways what do I call you guys, shark boy was kinda rude, sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm Jinbeisame. Though y'can do like my friend 'ere and call me 'Beisame'.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I am Satoru, Daigen.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) jabbed a thumb at their chest.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Saigosame. I don&#39;t have a fun nickname like Jinbeisame over there.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Saisame.. Gosame..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Juts-- Anyway! If you're ever looking for me, just call out for 'Hana'. I'll answer. That or someone who knows me will.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s eyes seem to scrutinize the two males indiscriminetly. <font color = white>&#34;Sweet, cool names, I&#39;m Higane.&#34;</font> She paused, clicking her lips before continuing.

<font color = white>&#34;Hi-ga-ne&#34;</font> She&#39;d add as her name continues to be mispronounced by many for whatever reason.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hiii-gaaa-neee. Gotcha'.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: No... no no no. You know what.. close enough.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) scratched at the side of her head. This wasn't supposed to be confusing!</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: What jutsu are you even interested in, Daigen.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: So.. Not Hee-Gaahh--Naay... but Hiii--Gaa--Nee?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm. Well Katon for one along with shurikenjutsu perhaps.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh... maybe I come up with a nickname instead-- Oh sweet, that sounds cool.. You have an affinity for that? I have no elemental affinity according to the chakra papers.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: No one from my clan really does, its weird. Maybe we're aliens.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, I don't think *everything* has a certain affinity for chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Like goats! You think every goat would utilize a different element? That'd be too complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I feel as though it'd be easy to guess my affinity.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Erm.. guess you're right.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Lets see..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Though I plan t'use nothing but weapons and shit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) comes closer to Jinbeisame.. a sharp pair of eyes clock even the most minute of details from his visage.

<font color = white>&#34;Yup, ya look earthy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) laxly pointed a finger towards the male&#39;s gills.

     <font color = white>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t breathing Katon mess with your chest? You&#39;d be turnin&#39; yourself into seafood!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) inhaled and exhaled. This was such a worry he did <i>NOT</i> take into place. 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh God, you&#39;re right.. That means it must be..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: ...!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) snaps. She&#39;d snatch the words right out of his mouth.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: WELL TRAINING BEGINS NOW!

        Whilst others would be wary or on edge - Jinbeisame was.. surprisngly wholehearted. His arms pumped as he relives on that moment that played on him momentarily.

Each fist was tightly clentched, concealing the items sorted within. Immediately responding to the projectile thrown in his direction, The red-headed child executed a juke and spin at the last minute. 

Finding some confidence in his talent, the child sprinted forward with the intent of closing the distance. Responding in a similar manner, his right hand open to reveal tooth picks. Wedging one between his index finger and middle, the flick of the wrist would send the wooden tool towards Najiro's callus feet.

He suppose the wooden senbon he&#39;d dodge earlier did manage to connect but not enough to inflict and injure. 

<font color = white>&#34;Aw mehn, Imma have to get this sewn up again&#34;</font> he muttered underneath his breath. Returning his focus back on Najiro, the sprinting child reloaded his hand again with another toothpick.

With only a flick of the wrist, another toothpick makeshift senbon was sent through the air, targeting the callus feet once more.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: How much for senbon kind sir?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) pumps a fist into the air.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you sell Kunais.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afro,i will check whats going on over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) needed a moment to realize she suddenly got a bunch of money from her new friend. <font color = white>&#34;Wait are you sure about this?!&#34;</font> then quickly she had to turn around to talk to the blacksmith, she was very overwhelmed by all of these things going on. <font color = white>&#34;O-okay then! I &#39;unno exactly when I&#39;ll pay you back but I&#39;ll come back and pay full price! Thank you mister!&#34;</font> she bowed towards Junji before looking at Hana again. <font color = white>&#34;Okay, I owe you one big time. I won&#39;t forget this.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Forgive me merchant, what might I refer you as?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) looks to the side, as his very poor hearing still managed to catch some of the discussion.
<font color = white>&#34;Keh keh.. young man. I already told them about the supply chain issues. But do you think kids that still smell of milk can understand?&#34;</font> he chuckles</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Junji Ogura.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I have you marked down for the kunai and senbon.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) ignored the manner as to which the merchant was flamboyant, and offer a smile. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Junji of the Ogura family.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Is it free one?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: But goodluck!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Your father is very cool. Uh, are you okay though?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: How'd you get one?

He states before bowing to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Thank you for the insight.&#34;</font>

With that he wanders off to find his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Yurei.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Weird kid. But at least he got manners..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Hey mista', what's on the menu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) points to himself when hearing the mention of weapons.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm going to buy that man's horse.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: How would the old man react to you bringing a horse home?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks toward the ground in thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I suppose you're right.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...buying their horse will be very wrong.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shakes his head. <font color = white>&#34;This old man hasn&#39;t brought anything beside..&#34;</font> he rummages through his pockets <font color = white>&#34;..two sticks worth of joints. But I doubt kids like you would be interested.&#34;</font> he shrugs, as he rolls a cig for himself.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Well shiit'
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: We don't have them in stock yet, old man.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: No one gon' know, 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to the male. <font color = white>&#34;...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It's not a horse. It's a donkey.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yells: Tsk-tsk.. kids these days.. I am a moral merchant! Shoo!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Yes'suh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) chuckles, stepping back and munching on his bag of Burritos</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So yer' a merchant that doesn't have anything to sell?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) tucks the flute into her back pocket in exchange for a pair of white dice. 
       <font color = white>&#34;This is a game I learned as a child and I used it to determine who would have leftovers between me and my late brother.&#34;</font>

The tone was upbeat despite the tragic news. 

<font color = white>&#34;The game is simple and the winner will model and recieve the very first edition of my plushie collection for free. I&#39;ll start to sell them afterwards, and that is assuming you make enough of a name for yourself to earn one.&#34;</font>

The dice are thrown into the center for the group to expect. The numbers were digital-and advanced. <font color = white>&#34;The game is called &#39;200&#39;. Everyone will roll the dice using &#39;200&#39;. The number you get will act as your next roll number, and it could range from 199-to-1, it all depends on your luck.&#34;</font>

With a soft laugh, she concludes. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll keep rolling &#39;your&#39; lowest number until you get to &#39;1&#39;. The last person to hit &#39;1&#39; will be the winner. Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Maybe we should be talkin' to that one over there.. I think they said their name was Junji or somethin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shooes away the willful kid as he turns his attention to Ogura <font color = white>&#34;You are correct young man. The supply chain won&#39;t be fixed for a couple of months still.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: inspect*
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'm a girl..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sorry to hear that flute girl..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It's okay, that is a story for another time.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But alright...guess i will play,i already know im gonna lose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her attention back to A&#39;suno, and listened. As she started to describe the game, the smaller, blue-haired, angry-looking girl recognized it as the same game that other children had been playing near the arena. It even had the same name. She wondered if it spread from Akihabara, or if it had just spread to Akihabara. Either way, she was ready to play.

<font color = white>&#34;Prepare to lose, Yurei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah, right
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Hey, mista'
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's hope this one isn't just for show..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the explanation of the game.
 <font color = white>&#34;Sounds like it&#39;s based on a roll of the dice.&#34;</font> Therefore in his mind, if he lost, it was only fate.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got this. Their gonna be sowing Mugen dolls until their fingers bleed. Ehahaha.&#34;</font> He laughed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares at the plump youth for a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t sell armor in your size, yet.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I look forward to the challenge, "Mugen".
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who is going first?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: The forge isn't open at the moment, but I can take orders.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) ponders for a moment. <i><font color = white>&#34;Luck..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) reached into her pocket--

<font color = white>&#34;Actually, I don&#39;t have a dice. Can I borrow one, A&#39;suno?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hrnn
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So how's it work? We place an order an' then you come to our village to deliver?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) sweatdrops</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I can come to you or you can come to me. Either works.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I just need a name and what you need.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) caught the cubes and then, with a twirl, unleashed them onto the ground between them!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will grab the dice and roll</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Akimichi, Gosu.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks to Yurei, since it seemed they'd be going counter clockwise.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Let me know when ya' got some 'rmor
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Akimichi, huh? I think our innkeeper is one of those.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) rolls-</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) did not laugh. But she did, internally.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) would take hold of the dice and allow them to roll off of his hands gentley.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) felt to the ground, his rolling luck was habitually low.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How much do sets of shuriken cost?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) feels the presence of a bird fly past his head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm this place is rather nice looking.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: A Doll?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will roll the dice once more,hitting on some random number</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I don't have prices yet, I'll let you know once I make them.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Fair enough.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'd take uhhh..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes the dice and rolls again, gulping.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: What exactly do ya mean by a doll? Someone making dolls? Also hey Rei
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Four sets of shuriken and one kunai.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Name's Uchiha, Reilin

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) tilted their head down as the older individual lowered themselves to their height. The slits of the eye mask now level with their own eyes. He would continue to observe the mask, taking mental notes of its intricasies and design.

<font color = white>&#34;Hasn&#39;t everyone lost someone..&#34;</font>, they would say solemnly. His small child-like hand would reach out attempting to touch the mask, if allowed he would simply rest his hand where the cheek would be and speak.

<font color = white>&#34;It has to be awfully lonely. Knowing that when you&#39;re time comes, noone will remember your face. That&#39;s so sad.&#34;</font>, they said, continuing to stare into the masked individuals eye slits.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (no event just rp'ing for shits and giggles)

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: ... What is this?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) 1/6 cd</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would tilt his head towards the reaching hand, before quickly raising his own hand to meet it. He would squeeze as hard as he could at first, before softly releasing the pressure, and pushing the arm down. Truly, the masked figure didn&#39;t understand what this sentimental motion was. In fact...he&#39;d tilt his head towards the child, before slowly raising to his feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Most may have lost people, but I am one whose not lost a single soul that they&#39;ve cared for. I put my job before my emotions. To have such emotions...to cry over the dead, is beneath me.&#34;</font> He would show the page once more, before beginning to write even more

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need anyone to remember my face, nor do I crave to show it to anyone here.&#34;</font> He would show towards the child, before looking over at the other kid that had spoken up. Moving to the side, and straightening his head once again, he would remain looking through the eye-slits of his mask. Writing down on a seperate piece of paper.

<font color = white>&#34;This child was asking me qiuestions about my life. Nothing more, nothing less. Is there something you need?&#34;</font> He would flash the parchment towards the red-headed child.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (you can rp afro if you want to join in)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (afro?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (Guess Ill go)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Afro(The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) OOCs: (im here now
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (oh go ahead then lol)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) draws in closer and observes the masked figure unsure as to what was developing. <font color = white>&#34;Eh... is everyone okay over here? He asked towards his fellow village-man.&#34;</font> 

Afro arrived too late to overhear the conversation but would make note of the figure&#39;s attire.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Hmm... are you a member of the village military?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) feels his hand get grabbed as he attempted to touch the man&#39;s mask. In the next instant, he would feel his hand being squeezed almost to the point of being crushed by the older man though just as quickly as the pressure was applied, it would softly released.

<font color = white>&#34;Ow!&#34;</font>, he yelled out, holding his hand with his other non-squeezed hand, examining it, as a purple and bluish bruise appeared. It did not take much, as he was clearly quite frail.

<font color = white>&#34;Well...That wasn&#39;t very nice.&#34;</font>, he said, as he continued rubbing his bruised hand. <font color = white>&#34;You must not have any friends if that is how you act. No need to be so harsh mask guy.&#34;</font>, they said, their cold exterior quickly overtaking the moment of surprise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) took note of the passive force displayed and waited for a response, though he was young, the academy student was well aware all intel whether big or small was vital when formulating a course of action. However, he thought it was pretty childish and naive to approach such a towering figure un-armed, especially in the blood-thirsty ninja world. 

Thought: <b>Maybe this is the perfect time to ask</b>

<font color = white>&#34;If you are indeed a shinobi of the village, would you be willing to take me on as a student? I would vow never to speak of your existance nor pesture you for your mentorship.&#34;</font> 

Afro intent was truly to learn the way of the shinobi. 

<font color = white>&#34;As a token of our arrangement would you willing to gift me a single kunai with your engraving?&#34;</font>

Should the figure accept, Afro&#39;s journey as a shinobi would begin. Creating a storyline far different from those in the limelight. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Walaaahhh~.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: ...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would look toward the afro haired child, before nodding at his question. The masked individual had multiple layers on which made it very difficult to see any skin on his body. The only noticeable thing would be his white spikey hair. Other than that...there was no hint as to what he looked like. He would once again take to his book and his pen.

<font color = white>&#34;I will not apologize for the bruise that has formed on your arm. You would be the same, if you have lived the life I have been through. Spies within your own village from another, trying to find the person they are looking for, just so they can finally be rid of Amegakure&#39;s Executioner.&#34;</font>

His visage would look towards the afro kid, before shaking his head no. Once again, taking to another page of the book and writing down again.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not take students, personally. But...that does not mean I will not be making sure you all are in tip-top shape to take the lives of our enemies. Perhaps, if one of you proves yourself within the coming year or two, I will change my mind, Just know...I will be watching and paying attention to your growth. A of current, it is too early to decide if any of you are worth my time to personally oversee your training and abilities.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Hey!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Amekagure...Executioner?
<br><font color=red>*Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffff66>Kyumuku, Koyabashi (The ugly bully-Dezzrox) gestures at the masked figure. <font color = white>&#34;Nice mask, nerd.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Hey guys..whats going on?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Well this Amekagure executioner guy almost broke my hand. Look!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) holds up his small blue and purple hand which is obviously bruised from nearly being crushed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With that guidance, the girl bursts onto the scene of gathered individuals. She steps forward, her height in stark contrast to the masked individual. The contents of their conversation don&#39;t even register in her mind. Throughout that group, only one youth gains the attention and ire of the blonde&#39;s sunset-colored iris.

     <font color = white>&#34;<b>Runt!</b> We&#39;ve still got a score to settle!&#34;</font>

One hand moves to her own hip. The other extends outward, a dedicated point thrust right towards the cold one&#39;s face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) Took note of the figures words and recorded his title as <b>Amekagure Executioner</b>

Squinting his eyes he&#39;d respond, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be sure to rise up to the occation and claim the position... I to will become a shadow of the village&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: hana...stop this
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid-sentence when he hears a familiar screech. Quickly hiding his hand back in his kimono sleeve. He would look over to the blonde haired hag from the other day.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh no.&#34;</font>, he thought, slowly moving backwards away from the girl, his cold eyes intently locked onto her.

<font color = white>&#34;You stay away from me, ha-....Lady..&#34;</font>, he said coldly. Best not to antagonize one with such monstrous strength.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Should be fine, Naji'.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;No can do!&#34;</font>

Even the mentions and quick brandish of his injured hand don&#39;t phase her or halt her approach. Once more, that invisible spark of tension radiates from her eyes as the two lock their gazes. Her target had already been set.

     <font color = white>&#34;Executive orders, short-stuff. Hand over your shoes!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: What she said. Would rather strong-arm them from you than one of my cousins.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would hear some rather newer voices, one&#39;s he hasn&#39;t even seen or met yet. It had seemed the village was bursting with energy, but...he didnt care for the commotion in which was going on. He didn&#39;t turn his visage towards anyone, in fact, he was focused on one thing and one thing only. The destroyed village that was currently needing to be Reconstructed. So, the masked figure would push his way through the younger generation, giving them no time of day.

He had decided, to be done with conversing for now, especially while there was work to be done. The book and pen, would be placed within his equipment. Before he would finally speak, a low and dark voice would come out of his mask.

<font color = white>&#34;If you wish to fight each other over some trivial matter...then proceed.

But, if you wish to show me your value and worth to the village...then it&#39;s time to put your actions where your mouth is. In but a few moments, I am going to begin Reconstructing our Bridge that was blown up by those damn Dakuteika heathens.

So, either help...or get out of my sight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: ...okay but why did you ordered they to be beaten..and their shoes removed?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) points at Hana's barefeet.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....oh
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well guess the shoes is justified now
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Well, not <b>bare</b> but wrapped.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Who are you to question me, child?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: I'm willing to be an assistant to the restoration of the bridge.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Certainly not a soldier of mine.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The student who is gonna be medic,and has common sense.
<br><font color=green>*Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) says: Hm...seems it's already been done...wish I would've been informed of this. Oh well. Beats a day of work for me to do.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Watch your tone.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's yer direct superior yer get snarky with.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) Their answer was that final straw for the blonde. Her hands moved from their pointing, relaxed positions and instead dropped to her side. Just like the day(s) prior, they slowly began to curl themselves into fists. She took a singular step forward, the wraps around her soles pressing against the concrete.

     <font color = white>&#34;Just don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t give you an out, runt!&#34;</font>

It takes only a jolt for her to take off into a full fledged sprint. Step after step is made in dangerous approach of the youthful one. With her target locked, there wasn&#39;t exactly anything going to stop her from making her way over to them.

Just how would they respond?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Don't end up like wedgie-boy from yesterday.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I won't.But with how seems on daily basis we have people who do this? im losing hope
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Good soldiers follow orders, man. We're not all peace, love, and sunshines 'ere.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Your hope matters nothing to me or my soldiers.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) pulled forth a cloth with his clan's crest printed on it. Use this to summon me.

With the stealthy talents of the mask figure, he could easily places it in the shadows in the uzumaki's line of sight to catch his attention. Summoning him to where ever the cloth placed, serving as a marker.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: They will do as their told and I will see the results of it.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Question me again and you can receive punishment too.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: A punishment for what exactly?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: For a senju not doing anything?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Insubordination, for one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) looks around attempting to find a way out of this situation. What kind of odd request was it to have them remove their shoes. They would not be subject to suggest indignity.

Continuing to move back towards the bridge. They would scan their environment looking for a way to defend themselves from the encroaching assault.

<font color = white>&#34;Why don&#39;t you just go away and leave me alone.&#34;</font>, he said, continuing his retreat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: If y'don't like what you see, stay quiet and watch.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) moved his arms under neath his poncho, folding them as he watched on. Going two againstr one seemed as if it would do very little. Thus, opting to let Hana have her fun seemed more probable.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Why shall i stay quiet and watch if i don't like what i see.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Najiro, I'm trying to *help* you, but you don't see it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) One by one, her hands swung with those galavanting strides. Each audible step just gave a warning and reminder of the damage she was capable of inflicting. To step back was to delay the inevitable.

     <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one making this harder on yourself&#34;</font> She calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure (The executioner-CConlin216) would turn around, staring at the afro haird child as he seemingly ripped off a piece of cloth with his clan&#39;s crest on it. The masked figure didn&#39;t even move his arm upwards to take the cloth. Instead, he would look straight through the sole of the Uzumaki.

<font color = white>&#34;I do not need a piece of cloth to summon you. If I find myself in need, I will take The Commander above a Student. Like I have said before...I am watching you all. Waiting to see which one of you, and only one, interests me the most. I would suggest, focusing on your training for the next year or so.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....listen,this fight could had be done in the proper grounds aswell
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its in the middle of the street..
<br><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Uzumaki, Afro has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Oyi, what am I mission out now?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (could try GM-H'ing and asking @najiro)
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Right. Though, I have to ask..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (think to suggest that in disc to see if they like the idea XD)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) When the Yuki walks past her, Tsukiko only gives him an arched eyebrow. What <i>would</i> convey confusion invites something else. A dare, almost, for them to try their luck once more.

     <font color = white>&#34;When they lose then.. What happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: It will happen again and again until you lose.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: I'm off. Cease your battles in my absence.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Aye, aye.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: That.. sounds like it'll be annoying.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....this is so stupid
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But i rather question why shall i kill someone from our village if im not given enough information
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Because it's an order.
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't think anyone said anything about doin' that.. but you'd just do it because you were told to. Its not that complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: See...thats my issue.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Precisely.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There needs to be a reason
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's what's bein' a Shinobi is about.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: There is a reason.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: They said so.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Mhm.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: Picture this; Red Commander tells Beisame to kiss you. I don't think he'd want to do it at all.. but an order is an order!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Guess you will realize it later.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If he tries to kiss me i will kick them in the croutch

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Eh? I'm not kissing no man.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You are the people who love to hit eachother on the head,not me.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yaaaaawn. Don't dwell on such things.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I don't know about 'love'. I only did it because they kept callin' me old.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) blinks. She was still quite short and lightweight.</font></font></font>

The girl mentions whilst giving the bow a pat on the head. Turning her attention back to the plaid eyed girl, she goes to speak- only to see them getting flanked with an embrace. 
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. pft.&#34;</font> Leaving them be, she turns her attention back to the kid. <font color = white>&#34;-anyway. I miss anythin&#39; major?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) continued to stare at the sukeban idly, blinking once after an unaturally long amount of time glaring them.

They&#39;d widen her plaid eyes when she suddenly felt arms wrapping about her, a shiver came quite immediately on the first moments of contact, and yells. <font color = white>&#34;AAAAAAH!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Boop!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Yah miss me huh, Mika?! I know you did.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) turn to his big sister&#39;s side as he replies, <font color = white>&#34;Aside from the bridge being destroyed and me having to rob a hoshigaki of his shoes under the Commander&#39;s order... not really&#34;</font>

Moving forward, the bot would adjust himself to take a seat along the steps leading up tot he village&#39;s monument. 

<font color = white>&#34;How have you been, I haven&#39;t seen you since enrollment it feels like.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Hmmm... I believe I'm being assaulted.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) yells: Eh!?!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) asks: Huh. Did he have nice shoes, at least?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: By who!? I'l get em! I got your back bestie.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) throws a few stray air jabs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: I didn't really pay any attention to them. It was just an order that I was following really.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Mm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ....Oooh.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: You.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) pays no mind to the &#39;assault&#39; happening to the north. As the boy shows interest, she steps between them and him to lift a finger.
   <font color = white>&#34;Oi! Remember- don&#39;t get involved unless ye&#39; know &#39;em, or you&#39;re gettin&#39; paid.&#34;</font>

With those words of wisdom(?) shared, the delinquent tucks her hands in her pockets and steps out from betweem him and them, to walk down the stairs.
   <font color = white>&#34;But-- I&#39;ve been good. Nothin&#39; changes... What about you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pipes up, the mention of the commander spurring the girl to action. She approaches the duo of off-white haired youth. Attached to her hip are a standard pair of sandals-- ones clearly too small for her to wear.

Her own feet bare nothing more than wraps. <i>Strange</i>

     <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that anymore. I took care of it.&#34;</font> she states to the reserved youth.</font></font></font>

She gives them a quick once-over before cracking a little grin. Turning to face them in earnest, she steps up and drops the tip of her finger down at the blonde&#39;s shoeless, dripless feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Hah! What&#39;sa matter, can&#39;t afford some <i>shoes?&#34;</font></i> She emphasizes the word by giving the sandles strapped at the blonde&#39;s hip a condescending flick.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) asks: Ahh, good--.. erm. Landmines?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A mere slip of the tongue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: . . O-okay. Just makin' sure.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) squints, her eyes taking note of the unfamiliar face. Her eyes needn&#39;t follow the finger-- the comment is something that the blonde had become accustomed to as of late.

     <font color = white>&#34;They&#39;re just a waste of money. Bunch of wraps&#39;ll get the job done.&#34;</font> She responds. Her own hands move towards the pair clipped to her person. She taps them once and then--

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Sides. These are bein&#39; held on Red Commanders orders.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) awaited her impending doom.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I just need 20 ryo. I'll pay you back double later.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: I think the Tournament was canceled?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) twitched. 

   <font color = white>&#34;It hasn&#39;t finished, so many people seemed to vanish,&#34;</font>

She then shifted towards the young Student, her hand easing back to nestle the hilt of a massive blade adorned across her back. An Odachi of gigantic mass, and weight yet she eased back once she realized what was about to occur. 

She had no reason to inflict lasting harm, not now but perhaps later.

   <font color = white>&#34;I forgive you,&#34;</font>

A cold-stir of words, and she moved to extend her hand and SLAM it into her stomach much as she had done someone else earlier today. A brief adjustment in behavior if anything. 

She then moved to ease back towards her spot, and her hand pushed back behind her back to meet the other one.

The sentiment didn&#39;t sit right with her. Instead of suggesting she nab the shoes off of another, the Hozuki opts to disprove the notion right then and there. Just as she was about to go dig up some sharp gravel for the girl to walk across, her attention was stolen by a blurred movement nearby.

By the time she got her eyes centered on the dancer, their fist had already connected, leaving her to watch in awe as the student, presumably, buckled and fell from the weight behind the strike.
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. Damn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Higane.

    As the muscular, odachi wielding shinobi approached her Nahoko remained as silent and as still as possible. Perhaps somewhere in the back of her mind she thought that if she didn&#39;t move or make a sound she wouldn&#39;t be the nail that got hammered.

   Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case as the act of the elder shinobi&#39;s fist slamming into her stomache at a speed far exceeding her contention instantly caused her to double over in agony.
       A few dry heaves reverberated through the area as an intense, burning pain spread through the girl&#39;s body in relation to the action.

She stared onwards with a blank look in her face. The words of Najiro snapping her out of it. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. huh? What&#39;s up Naji.&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) took a moment to produce a singular item from within her sleeve, it was a singular Senbon and she motioned to toss it over towards the young lad to catch as he wished. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Here you are,&#34;</font>

She stared him - that meant he was done.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) stood in front of Miss Botan, but their gaze shifted to the crimson-haired veteran and the task they gave them.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, Umm...Kunai, Shuriken and Log.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) sweats a little.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Only a little though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) quickly moved to do as she had done before, and produced a singular shiny-metallic item from within her sleeve. This time? It was a Shuriken, a singular Shuriken - it wasn&#39;t much but it was still free.

She handed it over.

   <font color = white>&#34;Continue,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) picked up the shuriken and palced it into their bag thanking the chuunin </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) once more moved to produce an item from her sleeve, and this time it was the last of the fundamental three. A singular, freshly sharpened, and steel-carbon infused Kunai. 

It was basically a fancy knife, and she tossed it over towards the young man. 

   <font color = white>&#34;A Kunai,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) chuckles nervously at the look he was being given.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) tried her hardest to nod her head to Beisame's beat. Eventually, she found the rhythm.

...A shame that the rapper couldn't.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked. 
blinked.
blinked.

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Next,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Wwwwwooooaaaahhhhhhh!&#34;</font> 

he comes crashing down into a tree not hurt in the slightest yet he was definitely dazedf fro, the one way trip.

<font color = white>&#34;What...just happened yoi?&#34;</font> he said his head dizzy as he was suddenly seeing birds fly around him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) tripped.

Oh no.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) let out a sigh as it seemed Afro was alseep at the moment and so their plan needed to wait</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) took a moment to produce a singular shiny object from within her sleeve, and the young sukeban was presented with a single steel-laced, carbon fueled, and freshly stoned Kunai. 

It was dropped in front of her to catch as she wished. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Good attempt,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded as she was answered; she stood there for a moment - and then looked around towards the others before she briefly took a moment to speak. 

   <font color = white>&#34;That is correct, and for extra credit - what happens when you break these gates and allow Chakra to flow uncontrolled?,&#34;</font>

She had already moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve, but which weapon would she decide upon?</font></font></font>
