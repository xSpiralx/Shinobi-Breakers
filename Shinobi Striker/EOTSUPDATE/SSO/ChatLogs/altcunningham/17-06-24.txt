A violently, horrific word slams into her ears. It was the same word that caused the situation from last night. It was the same word that powered up those dangerous fists of hers.

And it would be the same word that solidified the amount of damage she&#39;d inflict upon the cold youth.

As his hands come together to formulate those seals, one of her own mixes between the two to slap them out of order. There wouldn&#39;t be a puff of smoke or any clones-- only the fiery wrath of the blonde as she forcibly entered his space.

Her other hand extended downward, a violent push aimed towards the youth&#39;s face to shove him into the ground. Excessive, sure.. but he&#39;d certainly asked for it.

Before he could process the next movement, a hand would grab the top of his head, causing his face to slam into the concrete with a violent force. The blood curdling scream of a child would erupt from him, as the stern concrete mashed the soft bits of his facial flesh with his skull.

He would lay there severly bruised with blood leaking down their small forehead. He would feebly raise his arms to the ground attempting to before passing into unconciousness.

There wasn&#39;t an ounce of restraint in it, clear by the lack of worry or response from the blonde as their face bounced on the pavement. She stood above him, her hands still twitching with the anticipation of more. Clearly, their last exchange of blows didn&#39;t teach the cold one anything.

Fortunately, despite this rage, she wasn&#39;t some sort of psychopath.

Those jittering palms made their way to the cold youth&#39;s shoes. That cry and the surrounding blood were, yet again, idly ignored as she took to reaching down towards those shoes. Clutch as much as they&#39;d like, she pulled and pried those two straight from his feet.

With them in tow, she took to holding them both with a singular hand; her index and middle finger capable of hoisting them up. She immediately about faces, her attention already upon the instructor of said punishment.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) sighed. She eased forward slowly, and suddenly rushed to the area of the attack - she noted the injuries, and the outcome but that wasn&#39;t what truly caused her concern. 

She noted blood, blood touching her pavement - ruining her street and it caused her to briefly chuckle. 

   <font color = white>&#34;As stated before, anything done to the village will be applied to you - and I see blood on the street,&#34;</font>

Even in the view of a higher-up, she didn&#39;t truly care and suddenly she moved to curve her hand around and lurch a singular fist towards the stomach of the Student. It wasn&#39;t designed to inflict injuries, just a subtle method to ensure they remember. 

   <font color = white>&#34;That will be all,&#34;</font>

She had obtained her mission objective; the small one had been punished for their injuries. All was <i>mostly</i> right with her world.

    <font color = white>&#34;See that, Beisame? That&#39;s how you--&#34;</font>

Unfortunately, that lock onto familiar faces cost her. Before she could even finish her sentence or identify the attack, a devastating shot rocked the tanned one&#39;s midsection. She immediatly lurched forward, her grip upon the boy&#39;s sandals <i>nearly</i> releasing from that shot of pain.

All of the energy within her body was forcefully knocked out of her. She nigh crumbled just from that singular strike alone-- forced to shaky knees. If the dancer wasn&#39;t holding back, it was certain that the blonde would have been reduced to the same unconcious state that she left the cold youth.

     <font color = white>&#34;W-Wait.. I-I&#39;m..&#34;</font> She tried to speak.. but that fresh damage made it impossible to formulate a sentence. Pained, weakened eyes mixed with her expression to convey a message;

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had already shifted, and turned in place - agile grace, and practiced movements could be noted while her hands instantly moved behind her back and furled into a locked grasp. 

She seemed as if nothing had occured. 

   <font color = white>&#34;When you can stand again, please do ensure that blood is cleaned up - and try not to let the Yuki die,&#34;</font>

The soft thuds of bare-feet with trimmed cloth could be noted while she eased back to her original location. She had finished what she needed to finish.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) throughout the use of the convienient diversion made by the higher up, Nahoko approached the profound blonde and looked down at her.

In such, the boy closed the distance from his previous position to the girl with blonde-hairs side.

The blue-scaled hand of the Hoshigaki grasping their wrist with somewhat decent strength. No where near his friends - but enough. With a face as dead-pan as the Uzumaki behind him, he began speaking.

     <font color = white>&#34;H-Hands.. off..&#34;</font> she called out as she slowly managed to rise to a standing position. Still dazed, she took note of <i>yet another</i> elder who brandished their prowess and power. Unfortunately, the blonde wasn&#39;t in any state to argue.

<font color = white>&#34;Hah! What&#39;sa matter, can&#39;t afford some <i>shoes?&#34;</font></i> She emphasizes the word by giving the sandles strapped at the blonde&#39;s hip a condescending flick.

     <font color = white>&#34;They&#39;re just a waste of money. Bunch of wraps&#39;ll get the job done.&#34;</font> She responds. Her own hands move towards the pair clipped to her person. She taps them once and then--

   <font color = white>&#34;It hasn&#39;t finished, so many people seemed to vanish,&#34;</font>

She then shifted towards the young Student, her hand easing back to nestle the hilt of a massive blade adorned across her back. An Odachi of gigantic mass, and weight yet she eased back once she realized what was about to occur. 

She had no reason to inflict lasting harm, not now but perhaps later.

   <font color = white>&#34;I forgive you,&#34;</font>

A cold-stir of words, and she moved to extend her hand and SLAM it into her stomach much as she had done someone else earlier today. A brief adjustment in behavior if anything. 

She then moved to ease back towards her spot, and her hand pushed back behind her back to meet the other one.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) push up off the ground and made his way over towards the hoshigaki.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's for something else.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Just help a fellow shinobi out.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (like headbands n stoof.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Considering today they didn't called us for work on that bridge.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Anyone want to pair up with me? Kinda want to make some reliable friends that I can depend on...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) <font color = white>&#34;A waste of money, huh...&#34;</font>
The sentiment didn&#39;t sit right with her. Instead of suggesting she nab the shoes off of another, the Hozuki opts to disprove the notion right then and there. Just as she was about to go dig up some sharp gravel for the girl to walk across, her attention was stolen by a blurred movement nearby.

By the time she got her eyes centered on the dancer, their fist had already connected, leaving her to watch in awe as the student, presumably, buckled and fell from the weight behind the strike.
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. Damn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Higane.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) knew that the moment following the slip of her tongue were simply the calm before the storm.
    As the muscular, odachi wielding shinobi approached her Nahoko remained as silent and as still as possible. Perhaps somewhere in the back of her mind she thought that if she didn&#39;t move or make a sound she wouldn&#39;t be the nail that got hammered.

   Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case as the act of the elder shinobi&#39;s fist slamming into her stomache at a speed far exceeding her contention instantly caused her to double over in agony.
       A few dry heaves reverberated through the area as an intense, burning pain spread through the girl&#39;s body in relation to the action.

<font color = white>&#34;T-that...scratched my itch.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) sharp eyes clock the lightning fast punch from afar, yet she failed to see when it was released..

She stared onwards with a blank look in her face. The words of Najiro snapping her out of it. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. huh? What&#39;s up Naji.&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I am glad to be of service.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) There&#39;s a familiarity in the dashing that takes place. In the instant that the blow connects with the fellow-blonde&#39;s stomach, her own hand moves to protect her gut.

     <font color = white>&#34;B-Believe me.. She&#39;s not walkin&#39; that off easily..&#34;</font> she comments absently, her palm nursing a freshly mended wound.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You missed some stuff happening recently
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The reconstruction of the bridge...the village announcement..that...weird commander.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: With that, I have a few small things to say.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh, did I? I took a trip with my parents to pray at a shrine. I was gone a few days.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Noting very important to be honest but...it was something
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: One, I would advise you all avoid loitering on the bridge for now - unless someone is with you.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Aye, aye!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Two, I want you all to find groups or figure out people you wish to work with. This will assist in formation of Squads.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A Squad is a group of people you will protect no matter the cost, this is a second family.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: We should spread out our medical aid.. I read in one of the books I sto-- I mean, I heard that there's usually only one medic per squad.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Ahem.. Yeah.

<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Naji the type to get his squad killed because he stopped to think rather than acting.

They said to the chuunin as their gaze roamed the different faces gathered around this point of the village. Many he knew, but there were also some strangers whose names escaped him, a reminder of the ever-expanding community they were a part of.</font></font></font>

Such a hold caused a cry to escape from his body. Yelping across the yard in a state of pure panic.
      <b><i><font color = white>&#34;Owowowowow.. Okay-okay-okay, you win, letgo-letgo-letgo&#34;</font></b></i>, his panic jibber-jabble multiplying as the pinch held on.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Log?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Huh.&#34;</font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) places her right hand on her chin and her left hand behind her back, quickly weaving a half seal with the hidden hand.

The veins, arteries and capilaries around her eyes bulge and slowly move across her face adorning them with jagged lines of raised skin. As her already sharp eagle eyes, awaken to their true state.

<font color = white>&#34;These are called Chakra nodes or Tenketsu.&#34;</font> As she spoke Higane, pointed straight towards Botan, her finger perfectly aimed at the Chunin&#39;s Tenketsu points.

<font color = white>&#34;The three most vital.. Hmm.. I&#39;d say the ones near the brain, heart and lungs.. Unless you mean the actual chakra gates, thats a different story!&#34;</font> She&#39;d say in a serious tone, not unlike her usual comments.</font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;That is correct, and for extra credit - what happens when you break these gates and allow Chakra to flow uncontrolled?,&#34;</font>

She had already moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve, but which weapon would she decide upon?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: Break the wha now yo?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) scans the Chunins body, scrutinizing her chakra network with the aid of the Byakugan. <font color = white>&#34;Hm..An interesting theory.. If possible, but that sounds like a fairy tale..  I&#39;ve never read about any of that in the medical books I&#39;ve sto-- I mean, borrowed.&#34;</font>

She&#39;d then slowly ponder the question for a few brief moments before offering a respone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d gues in theory, the gates would no longer impede the flow of chakra, allowing for its unrestricted flow.. So perhaps an increase in power?..&#34;</font> She&#39;d rationalyse the proposed theory.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hmm...Higane i got a question
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you can touch any tenketsu point
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why no hyuuga strikes the heart?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) smirked.

   <font color = white>&#34;That would be quite correct, unrestricted flow would allow someone to unleash the full length of their abilities unhindered,&#34;</font>

That young Hyuuga would see nothing out of the normal, outside the fact that her network was quite a raging wildfire of intensely flowing energy. She held her own secrets - and the network never lied. 

   <font color = white>&#34;In theory,&#34;</font>

A moment and her hand was presented, with -two- Senbon. They were tossed towards her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or any very lethal tenketsu point.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) catches the senbon with ease, tucking them inbetween her fingers as if she&#39;d practice it a thousand times before..

The vessels around her eyes relax as her Byakugan deactivates. <font color = white>&#34;I see.. Huh..&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment, tucking the senbon into her medic pouch.

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I&#39;d known you were gonna ask me about anatomy and stuff I&#39;d volunteer first! Miss Botan..!&#34;</font> She&#39;d jest returning to her playful demeanor as she backs off with a whistle.</font></font></font>
