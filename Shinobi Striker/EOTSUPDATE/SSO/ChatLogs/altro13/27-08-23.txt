<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5a5a8c>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) pulled off a stunt that even surprised himself â€“ snagging not one, but two hefty perch with just a single bait. Call it luck or call it skill, the guy had a knack for this stuff. Yet, even as he admired his fishy conquests, his stomach chimed in with a rather vocal protest. It was like his belly had its own opinions on the matter, and it was definitely not impressed.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll get your food when we get paid.&#34;</font> He murmurs to his grumbling belly once again. That&#39;s his motivator, to keep fishing with as much patience as the task demands him.</font></font></font>

In his own hand was a mighty rod that he had himself as he sends the hook adrift into the water and catching more fish along the way.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t forget to pay me back for the rod when you get paid! Hahaha!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Because we walk around all day on our legs.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: But if we walked on our hands then our punches would be strong.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: They look creepy. Has one ever hissed at you?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Yes. They have teeth on their tongues.

He was done, exhausted, and much like Hanako, he just plops down on a bar stool and raises a hand to make an order for the chef.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey chef, some barbecue meat, please... and water.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ramen Boss! One bowl of stock, please!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll have the double-udon with pork, a scoop of chicken, extra carrots, two bowls of fish cakes, and a slice of the day&#39;s pie, please.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly starts to roll around on the roof half asleep. It seems the smell of fresh food was starting make him unconciously hungry as drool slowly starts to slip out from his mouth saying.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gave a hearty laugh when hearing Hanako take the long way around to ordering a ramen. <font color = white>&#34;Y-yeah, he must&#39;ve had something in his eye.&#34;</font> He wipes a way a tear. Damn, these people he met today were just too much.

It would take a bit before his barbecue as finally served, and he even got a new weird guy sitting right beside him.  He would keep an eye on him in case he was one of those food thieves.

<font color = white>&#34;By the way, what did you all think of the first academy day? Wasn&#39;t like what I expected.&#34;</font> He thought it would be all about learning how to fight and putting it to practice.

Hearing the purple guy on the roof, he made another order. <font color = white>&#34;An udon as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninaest ninja-HoboCat) seemed far too healthy to be a food thief. Though with that on record, it also seemed as though the ninja was so far-removed from the idea of a food shortage that the kid's caution would go unquestioned. 

The odds of the two seeing one another as weird were high.

<font color = white>&#34;Dull, I didn&#39;t do much- It didn&#39;t improve my abilities either, I get it wwas a team wwork exercise but it didn&#39;t really play to any of my strengths-...&#34;</font> He then stared at the Dog, then the paper, then the dog again...</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Was that Miss Korme's dog?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) swiveled around in her chair, taking liberal advantage of its <i>spin</i>. It gave her prime viewing vantage for watching the ol&#39; Ramen Boss slap together their respective orders. It hardly took long at all. Everything was ready to be tossed onto the grill, if not already boiling. Minutes later? They were presented with bowls and plated morsels. 

<font color = white>&#34;Mmm..? It was.. very hands on. And by hands on I mean, like.. hands on rocks. We touched a lot of rocks today. I&#39;m not a rock person! I&#39;ve never climbed a cliff. But. I think I did, like, pretty good--&#34;</font>

She swiveled.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh? Something just.. walked up. It wasn&#39;t a person. Its light shined too.. tiny. Did anyone see it?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It was like.. over-there-ish. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: East? I think? Is that east?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninaest ninja-HoboCat) was too busy silently ordering a bowl of ramen to be distracted by a mere dog. He would've had to have been a regular for such a feat to be possible.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) didn&#39;t seem bothered with the rather gargantuan amount of food she was suddenly served up. A double-portion of noodles? With triple the toppings? A double portion of fish cakes on the side?! &lt;i&gt;Dessert?!?&lt;/i&gt;

She settled in to eat her meal when she no doubts felt the dog mozy on up to the stall for a moment before absconding once more.

<font color = white>&#34;...Ah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (Oh no, how does formatting work in rp...)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) saw the dog while taking a bite out of his barbecue, and upong following his cousin&#39;s gaze, he saw it. <font color = white>&#34;Well damn... let&#39;s go?&#34;</font> He was already up and digging in his pockets for money to pay for the food he bought. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m almost sure it was <b>the</b> dog.&#34;</font>

The money was thrown on the counter as he looked to his group for confirmation..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Wait..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: If it came here.. that means it was hungry. Right?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: What if we just.. left food in the road and hid?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) yells: Very likely... a trap then. Smart!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Then we jump out from both sides and pet him-- I mean catch him!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It might work.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly start to wake up from all of the noise as he would grogily look down saying to everyone.

<font color = white>&#34;Whaa... Did you guys find your dog?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) glanced between her food. Then the road. Then her food again... Finally, she opted to eat as much as she could while everyone else was busy discussing things... Just a few bites..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll take the southern flank! You guys handle the food! 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: We're now planning a trap for it! By the way, there's some Udon down here for you, enjoy it.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) yells: Sweeeet!
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) yells: Thanks!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: We couldorder steak for this, it might work the best.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: The leftovers are appreciated.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) started picking up the barbecue, but not before downing the water cup he had asked for. He really wanted to catch that dog, anything that could put him ahead of Shishorama or the others. <font color = white>&#34;Not leftovers, I asked it for you. You&#39;re a loud sleeper.&#34;</font>

Anyhow, barbecue now in a box!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) selfishly took her bowl with her. She's slurping down the what she could while she waddles her way into the river. Yes. <b>Into</b> the river. She just straight up disappears down there. 

Bubbles float to the surface seconds later. An underwater groan when she realized her dastardly plot to have her own meal for herself backfired. It washed away, right out the bowl, with the current. Welp!

<i>Nothing more to do than wait.. the pets-- I mean capture will make up for this blunder.</i> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (y'know, i really half expected there to be no dog while we're around lol
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Brad(The sleepy purple one-Altro13) OOCs: (The dog was the friends we made along the way0
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I'll hide behind the tree.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: If it's hard to find it, try barking at it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) shifted in-between the buildings to hide away, still munching away on her fish cakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was very confused by what he saw Hanako doing... just going down into the river with her bowl of Ramen.

Anyhow! The box with barbecue was placed in the middle of the street. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll go hide on the roof of the restaurant.&#34;</font> He grabbed the Udon and climbed up there, handing it over to the sleepy purple guy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: Dogs can't help responding to barks.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...Awoo.
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: That's the spirit.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i have no idea whow to remove that, but i like roleplay flags
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Brad(The sleepy purple one-Altro13) OOCs: (Leave it as a flex)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Brad(The sleepy purple one-Altro13) OOCs: (Replace it with expired bbq)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i can imagine the eventmin wondering "why haven't they followed"
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) sits behind the tree, surprised on how so far there is no sign of the Dog- He wondered how far the little guy wandered when they even left food for the pup.

Did the dog get that far already?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) socked a small-mouthed bass in the eye for getting too close to her. 
Nasty things. Minutes elapsed.

A need for air never arrived. Not like how the Senju described it. There was no pains in her chest. No stinging in her eyes. No signs of fatigue at all really. She felt nice and collected. Haze was the furthest thing from her mind. She's focused on the vague sensation of presences beyond the surface. So far--

<i>Just us. No dog.. huh. Maybe he'll come back when he feels enough time passed for us to leave? They probably have it down to a science, since he comes scavenging for food here often. He probably knows after people depart, that's the best time to find leftovers?</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly jumps down from the rooftop as he lands onto the ground making a small poof of dust before walking towards one of the stools as if nothing had happen. He would smile as he would grab a pair of chopsticks and begin slurping some Udon.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: Om nom nom.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) is starting to create a dislike for dogs.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Brad(The sleepy purple one-Altro13) OOCs: (i'm surprised there's an event so late at night)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (is it an event if we don't really know when it'll show up
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) wasn't so sure it even worked. Perhaps they'd missed their chance for the dog at this time, but at leasy she hadn't missed her lunch-- except for the slice of pumpkin pie currently plated on the table in the stand. She was eagerly waiting for the moment for the op to be called off so she could greedily consume it.

For she was no longer in possession of any fish cakes, they were all gone.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Brad(The sleepy purple one-Altro13) OOCs: (I nap)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (have a goodnight
