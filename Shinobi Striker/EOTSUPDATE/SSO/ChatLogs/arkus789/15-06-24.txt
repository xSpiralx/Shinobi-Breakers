<font color = white>&#34;Fubuki.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Umh.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) folded her arms and began thinking; what exactly could she even tell about herself?

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh, I dyed my hair. I guess that&#39;s cool. It&#39;s your turn now isn&#39;t it?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Oh! Do you want to play a game? Wait I didnt tell you about myself. Uh... I love art and I want to make games!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Games? Like what?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) placed her hands on her hips. <font color = white>&#34;Im 16 myself but that doesnt make it a children&#39;s card game! Its pretty competitive you know. And I will add some strategy in the mix.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hmm...fine. If you insist.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: But here is the game im thinking about for now. We will each ask each other 2 questions. You have to answer truth on one of them and a lie on the other. We have to decide which is which. Sounds fun?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I suppose it will do, very well.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Ok, Woudl you like me to be the asker first?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yes.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would think about what answer to ask. <font color = white>&#34;The first question. Why did you dye your hair?&#34;</font> She started off simple. The game could get very deep but that was up to the asker. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) jumped to the arena where Chobina was, folding her arms. She thought of the question for a while unsure whether to lie or say the truth before answering: <font color = white>&#34;Because I wanted to look cool.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: Ok now you ask a question. We take turns!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Why do you want to make games?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (Are we supposed to click starting incentive?)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chobina(The chubby black girl-LionHunter) OOCs: (nope
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (oh so the hidden traitt is the core u get, dope
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) thought about this for another pause.  She parted her lips to speak a suprising answer. <font color = white>&#34;I want to be a trailblazer. Do something that noone has done before. Within a world such as this, this can be alittle safe haven a dim light in the sea of darkness as it were. Why stick to the status quo when you can make something wholely yourself?&#34;</font>

That was the answer to her question. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hmm. Is that also your question or rhetorical?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: That is my answer.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Pretty poetic right?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah. I dunno what being a trailblazer is but you have your priorities set so, dope.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Being a trail blazer is is someone that takes a path noone has taken.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#701f1f>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) was holding a book..quietly reading it to herself as she walked into the area. She had lightly glanced up noticing some people was asleep and some was awake. Only one thing that stood out was her large red afro.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Why do you want to look cool? 
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: But in a village as big as this don't you think people have taken a lot of steps everywhere?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh, uh. Because, if I become famous one day I'd rather look cool.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Its a bit deeper than that. 
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Oh, I'm not good with deep stuff. Also it's my turn to ask you stuff right?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Its not following a physical path. More so following a path that noone has taken. Everyone wants to be a fighter, a medic, a chuunin, jounin, kage...But noone would ever want to be a game creater. A master of fun and fancy.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Mhm your turn to ask me a question.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched the back of her head while trying to understand all of that. She was too simply to get a concept like that.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Kay...well, aren&#39;t you training to be a shinobi too? Or are you just gonna be a game maker?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would answer with just as much bluster as the previous ask. <font color = white>&#34;Im training to be both. a game master and a shinobi. One will be a hobby and the other will be a job. The end goal is the same. I want to have fun and this is how I will achieve it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#701f1f>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Flipped through a page, before yawning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hmm...well, one lie and one truth. The first answer is a lie and this last one is true, did I get it right?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) claps her hands together. <font color = white>&#34;5 billion points. You got it right. Good sleuthing.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) nodded, trying to hide how proud she felt over a silly game. A small smile escaped her. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m just that good. Your turn to guess.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: I believe your first answer is a lie as well.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nope. The other way around actually.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: Oh really?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I like this hair color but I don't wanna look cool simply for being famous; I don't want to be famous at all.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: So you dont want to be cool?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: So why change your hair color?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I do wanna be cool, that's why I changed my hair color. Just not famous.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: After all aren't we supposed to be like, sneaky ninjas or something?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh im confusing myself. Silly me
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have lost. Negative five billion points it is.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: I mean... if you want to be a guess. Do you see me sneaking anywhere?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shrugged. <font color = white>&#34;Maybe, with training.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#701f1f>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times, before flipping through the page not understanding the meaning to the setence..before blinking once more.. choosing to ingore it and close her book before starting to lean down and started to do push ups, pushing herself up and down.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Im a bit too big for that
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) could see someone on the far side of her vision, it caught her attention since she suddenly began to do push ups. Fubuki waved at her. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, need help with training?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#701f1f>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Shifted her eyes up, as she was doing her excerises.. <font color = white>&#34;No.&#34;</font> That is what she said at first.. then spoke afterwards. <font color = white>&#34;I am okay, I don&#39;t need help.&#34;</font> She groaned..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh hey
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Hello

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) nodded at her. <font color = white>&#34;A&#39;ight, I&#39;m Fubuki by the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Utsuwa, Himeki
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-short-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: But you can call me hime!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Chobina Akimichi, but you can call me Bina! Its nice to meet you Hime.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Uh, what do Akimichi do?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) asks: What do you mean what do we do?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Don't clans do special stuff?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh yea! We have something others cant do.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Such as? 'Cuz I have no idea.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) yells: I dont know if its a secret of now, but we can grow big!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed to wake back up from a deep dive into the reflection of the water at her words.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ff99>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) turned to the two girl&#39;s over having a talk.

<font color = white>&#34;that..may be true...mm..&#34;</font>

There was a breif pause for a moment as rested her clipboard on her lap...mm 

<font color = white>&#34;um..what was it again..&#34;</font> She thought about it for a moment. 

<font color = white>&#34;Haru no hi no yōna yasashī kotoba wa atatakasa to seichō o motarasu&#34;</font> 

She paused for a moment before continueing her words. <font color = white>&#34; though i should probably stop being fancy, this phrase translates from the shogan as...&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;A gentle word, like a spring day, brings warmth and growth&#34;</font>

IS what she would say as she before quickly adding towards the end. <font color = white>&#34; Or so..the cheif at my favorite diner tells me..during my midnight shift...mm...&#34;</font> A light akward laughter left her lips...ahh..talking...mm

<font color = white>&#34;So after hearing this phrase..what does it mean to treat ...or how would you treat a terminally ill patient ?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) struggled with those words. The more modern tongue was something she understood; something she could speak with nary an accent. But the older tongues of this land were as challenging to her as her name was to them; as her ancestral homeland&#39;s old tongue.

Shuye tried to listen, but a little thing called pride made it difficult.

<font color = white>&#34;If they&#39;re going to die, then the two obligations are to make them live as well as they want, as long as they want. The second is to make their passing easy. But even if they are terminally ill, it would be selfish if they took that way out.&#34;</font> Shuye could figure that they weren&#39;t talking about how she would physicall try to attend to their ailments. Likewise, she understood the lesson. Be kind, because it can lead to good things.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d treat them exactly as they need to be treated.&#34;</font>

While practically a non answer, it was enlightening in its own way about her mentality.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) spotted a group of people standing nearby. She&#39;d lingered for a moment, shifting her gaze between each individual before stepping in to approach.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello.&#34;</font> she said calmly. Her tone was neutral as she greeted the lot of them.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked at the somber girl quizzicly.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s moment of tranquilty (and boredom) got interrupted once more - today was a lively day. She turned around and waved at the newcomer.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shirogane, Kusanari(The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) OOCs: (I should do that...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) finally makes some kind of approach; looking maybe a little rugged or something, like someone who&#39;d been playing in the dirt for a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;Whaaaa, a gathering! Hello!&#34;</font> he cheers in greetings.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times, unsure who they was talking to.. the smaller girl would quietly pull out a book and read to herself.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) also lightly waved at the boy who showed up.

<font color = white>&#34;Sup to you as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm.. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) looked toward the scowling red-eyed girl who opted not to respond and opted to give a look instead. The somber girl looked at her for a moment longer before her head trailed off toward Fubuki, her eyes following a moment later.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Reilin. Its nice to meet you all.&#34;</font> she said politely enough.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: A game of two hundred..
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: I like where this is going.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Messes around with dice and plays by herself seeing that she don't really have many people to interact with or be her friend.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Shuye.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Kusanari.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) asks: Aye red haired girl over there. I want to get in on that?
<br><font color=green>*Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) asks: Who am I suppose to report to?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Oh? You can, do ya know how to play?
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Of course I do.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) yells: Ready when you are!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) &#39;s eyes lit up when he sees and hears everyone just dropping their names like they were taking attendance in class. It&#39;s what he gets for paying only alittle bit of attention to any of them in there to begin with; far too gone in his own world to pay all that much attention to them, with only limited opportunity outside of classes to entertain the idea of hanging out with anyone.

Perhaps that changes today.
While making note of those who&#39;ve reintroduced themselves, he goes on for himself.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Venturo! Anybody like rocks?&#34;</font> he introduces, then asks.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Ooh well, hey I am Himeki!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) cold gaze would shift from each face as he waited for an answer. He wasn't much of a speak, but it seemed important to establish who was in charge by asking. He'd maintain his distance as he walked for a response.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Its nice to meet ya. ya can roll your dice.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Nice to meet ya. I'm Kusanari if you didn't know before.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) asks: ah!...report?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: ...Rocks...?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Yeah!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Why exactly do you like rocks?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) get&#39;s into the dice-rolling stance. Letting it loose he would prepare for the gods to bless him or fail him.<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m feeling it.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) folded her arms and thought about what Venturo said - it was all pretty harmless overall.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [ow i looked awa and they vanished]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) is very evidently shocked by the response. How could someone dislike rocks!? Accompanied by his shock is a gasp.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) That was a good question. She thought about it a bit more before answering.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t hate them, but I don&#39;t like them.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: What a strange game...
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Your move..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Oooh sorry!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Okies!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) was very calm even though his luck went to toast. Maybe a comeback can happen.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times, he seemed to be hanging on by a thread.. the girl tilted her head rolling the dice again.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Isn't a pebble just a pebble?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (easiestt comeback of all time, u got this kusanari

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) brings a loose fist toward his chest, bopping it down into his opposite&#39;s hand. That suddenly made a bit more sense, though not completely... 

<font color = white>&#34;I got it! One day, I will change your mind!&#34;</font>
A new quest has been unlocked.

When Shuye speaks on pebbles, he&#39;s suddenly shocked again.
<font color = white>&#34;Even pebbles have things to admire about them! The things you can use &#39;em for too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times, before lightly tossing the dice closing her eyes excepting to lose.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) nodded at Venturo.

<font color = white>&#34;So be it, I wish you luck - I guess?&#34;</font>

Then she began paying attention at the duel between Kusanari and Himeki. How could someone roll so unlucky and lucky at the same time?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) was drawing luck from the god&#39;s at this point.<font color = white>&#34;We will see.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Carefully watched him for a second, seeming to have fun.

But let me know if you want to play sometime.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned.

<font color = white>&#34;Sure, pebbles can have things to admire about them, but they&#39;re still just a pebble. Replaceable.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: We can play again if ya want and anyone else can join!
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Fubuki tag in.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sure.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Mm winner rolls first hehe
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Right.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Off to a good start.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Nuuuuuu
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Welp...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) falls on her knees and clenches her heart.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: That's normal.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He really is destined to be the greatest ninja of all time...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Maybe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) liked this little challenge that had been going on. He rubs at his chin a little bit as he ponders his rebuttal. 
<font color = white>&#34;Sure! But they won&#39;t be like the others... Sometimes even pebbles have the most beauty in them. Like-- what if you find one of your favorite color?! And it&#39;s perfectly smooth? You&#39;re not gonna wanna replace that, are you?&#34;</font>

As he posits his arguement out there, he starts pulling a backpack from off of his shoulders, and starts rummaging through it. After a few moments, he pulls one out. Mostly smooth on the surface, with a lime-green color to it.

<font color = white>&#34;Look at it! Isn&#39;t it cool?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Well your move Himeki.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Drat
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Man. I'm second place, technically.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched the boy rummage through his own things.

<font color = white>&#34;It isn&#39;t that you would want to replace it...&#34;</font> She sounded thoughtful, as if she had begun speaking before the thought had fully formed. She squinted at the pebble, wondering where it&#39;s color came from. <font color = white>&#34;...It&#39;s just that, if you lose your pebble. You wouldn&#39;t cry, would you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Nothing that big.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Shakes the dice lightly and throws it against the floor hoping for some good luck.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: Yay!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Phew.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Damm look's like I ran out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) peered up from the rock he was holding out toward Shuye as he listens to her. WOULD he cry if he lost this pebble..?
<font color = white>&#34;.. Maybe, maybe not - it depends on the memory I have with it I think... but! Even if I were to try and find another one like this one, nothing would be like when I first got this one. Here!&#34;</font>

He advances toward her, offering the lime-green pebble out to her.
<font color = white>&#34;If you keep this one, every time you see it, you&#39;ll remember us talking today!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nice.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Soooo cloooose

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) was calmly looking at the dice. With his last last roll it was up to the god's.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) grabbed her dice and threw it to the water.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I lost once, its not exactly that big of a deal
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Luck seems to always change
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) was too calm about this. He would pat Fubuki&#39;s head.<font color = white>&#34;You will win next time.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What's going on?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Playing a game called two hundred
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Ah that game.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) sighed before reaching into the water with her arm and picking the dice.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah...sorry.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko(The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) OOCs: (Atleast I can go without changing for a good 10+ years.  I am no good with using AI generators.  They always mess up on me so I just use what I cna find.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) considered whether or not to take the pebble. The sentimentality was not something she typically indulged in. There&#39;s a little hesistance, as her eyes flick from the strange stone, then back to him, and finally back to the stone.

<font color = white>&#34;Fine. But only because it reminds me of jade.&#34;</font> She said, stiffly. It was clear shew as uncomfortable, but also trying not to come off as rude becasue of it. The successfulness of this attempt was up for debate. <font color = white>&#34;And I miss my jade stones.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (Do you have a discord?)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) can&#39;t help but grin a little. He acknowledges her feelings, but chooses to disregard them for the time being. Mission complete..!

<font color = white>&#34;Great! Talk soon, Shuye! I gotta see what&#39;s going on in this game they&#39;re playing!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I think I'll pass...I've experienced defeat one too many times.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) has only lost once.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: You be fine.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I'm just waking up.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: WHOA!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) is suddenly running RIGHT up toward the six armed girl, completely in shock now. His bright eyes scanning her like crazy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve seen some people like you around before but I still didn&#39;t really believe it-- did-- did you know that...&#34;</font>

There&#39;s a dramatic pause.

<font color = white>&#34; .. You&#39;ve got SIX ARMS?!&#34;</font> he exclaims.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: You don't leave your house much do you?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: I leave my house tons! I just look at the ground more than I look at people.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: I'm always on another adventure. Gotta find the best rocks out there to bring home!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: --
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hahaha, well okay then.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) turns to look at the guy who moves up behind her and pauses for a moment, huuuuh?

<font color = white>&#34;Yes?  I got six arms.  What&#39;s wrong with that?  It&#39;s a family trait.  And I didn&#39;t know that...&#34;</font>

Though she noticed that someone else was beside her, was she popilar already?  Was she already winning in life?  Wao, so exciting!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would slowly begin to draw each marking..one by one on the tiles of the sparing  mattt.  

She felt she wasent going finish her notice for a while...and felt like giving the academy students..something to do asside from playing dice if they wanted! 

Though this game wasent f-...this obstical course wasent for the faint of heart. She was indeed waiting for her peers to awaken...but what mroe could she do but entertain while she was on the payroll!

<font color = white>&#34;a-ah..&#34;</font>

She then turned to face the others and placed a hand on her hips!

<font color = white>&#34;This is the academy obstical version two....if would like to  partake please head to the starting line....this is not a drill...&#34;</font> She paused. <font color = white>&#34;but dont feel forced...this is more of a voulnteer sort of deal..&#34;</font> The medic soon stretched a bit before lowering their arms to their side.

<font color = white>&#34;if i remeber correctly..the rules are as followed&#34;</font>

== Rules below ===

[Roll 20 Sided Die] [ 1-5 hit] [ 6- 10 graze] [ 11 - 15  semi miss] [ 16 - 20 miss]

hit =  move back 2 tile 
 
graze = move back 1 tile 

semi-miss =  neutral

miss = One extra tile movement forwards

<font color = white>&#34;you can make a action that would delay your opponents movement, but make sure your judgement is correct or you will just be giving your opponent a window to win..mhm&#34;</font>  

She paused for a moment. <font color = white>&#34; Everyone is born with a different set of luck...this is just to see how lucky you are in this life..and what risks you should take on your future missions..mhm...so if you wish to do it..have fun with it&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: ooh I want to play!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#7d7280>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) <font color = white>&#34;---&#34;</font> Six what?
His eyes slowly shift toward the albino and he narrows his gaze on them silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Hm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) &#39;s eyes are LIT UP when she responds to him. He couldn&#39;t believe it. They were real. Without so much as skipping a beat, both of his hands are balled into tight fists as he begins to shake them from the excitement.

<font color = white>&#34; You can literally count to thirty with all of your hands!! That is so cool! You&#39;re so cool! You can also scoop up so many more rocks at a time than me...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) side eyes the taciturn aspirant before flexing her six different arms.

<font color = white>&#34;To fourty if I use my toes.&#34;</font>

She teases the two-toned one.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Whoaaaa...I didn't even think of that!

The toad tried hitting her once more and, instead of either dodging or getting hit full on, it was a graze that made her go a bit slower than usual.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) felt almost completely confident now that she saw her closest rival stumble back. She grinned confidently.

Then a toad hit her right on the face, causing her to roll back to right where she was. She still had a lead, but for how long?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) scrambled back on her feet, seeing the leery boy nearly overtake her! Over her dead body, she would let him! Now they were neck, and neck.</font></font></font>

Keen eyes narrow upon the girl in front, the one with the light-purple hair. A whip of arm launched a pebble right for their forehead.

She halted before him, surprised to find someone actually her height, and age amongst the crowd of young teens.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave a slight yet respectful bow of head to their Sensei as they passed. A silent thanks for all their heart work.

It didn&#39;t sound like a request, but it wasn&#39;t spoken particularly forcefully either.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;How.. to aim?&#34;</font>

Aiming. Aiming. Err. Exactly how would someone place words to an explanation like that? Internal questionings surfaced in the wrinkle of brow while he pondered. Uh... 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nothing special. It&#39;s not something someone can really teach as much as it is something your body learns. You just have to throw a lot. I&#39;ve been throwing things ever since I learned how to close my fingers around objects, so..&#34;</font>

He paused to pluck up a flat stone. A whip of arm sent it spiraling like shuriken for the moat water. It skips a grand total of seven times before hitting the distant northeastern moat-wall with a solid clack!

<font color = white>&#34;.. practice makes perfect?&#34;</font>
He shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: In short? I throw by feel. That sounds about right. Instinct.

<font color = white>&#34;A decent way of looking at it. So. Did you get held back a year or two? Or.. did you get a late start?&#34;</font>

A moment&#39;s spent gazing across the moat, at all their peers, before refocusing on the tall one. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the latter. I gave up on learning my family&#39;s... <i>primary business</i> to do this. Never too late to start learning how to do violence for profit. Right?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>

While Shuye is temporarily keeping her attention off of him, he gives a few 'knowing' winks over toward the other kid's way. He has NO idea who he even is, but he's convinced himself... He will show the fellow kid the way before too long.</font></font></font>

Yeah, that sounds like the kind of personal matters anyone with basic common decency shouldn&#39;t ask about. So he didn&#39;t!

<font color = white>&#34;I see. Well. Best of luck to you, in your future laden with dodging rocks for the rest of the year. I won&#39;t go easy on you, if the legal opportunity finds me again,&#34;</font> he told them, wearing an unseen grin. </font></font></font>
