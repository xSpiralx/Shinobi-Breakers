'I can take him alone....but all three together would be the best challenge..'
He thought to himself, slowly plotting and waiting to see if the last two would join the hoshigaki in their stand here instead of running.</font></font></font>

With the punch thrusting through the air and in trajectory to Blast&#39;s stomach. It would..-miss its mark? Yes!! It missed its mark. How though. What was done?

<font color = white>&#34;Ehh. for the Commander you have to be quicker than that&#34;</font>, the Grandson of a True Hero would say while posed in shape of the letter &#39;C&#39;.

  Is this Blast's version of rebellion? Or is it his way of presenting his true self?

Regardless, Sogeki is on a mission. He doesn't care for the missed target-- there's always more ammunition in the tank.

The Satetsu loads his arm up again, clenching his fist even tighter. His nails dig into his palm, threatening to break skin any moment. Sogeki drive his fist forward, once more aiming to double Blast over.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: It begins with mindset.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) squinted his eyes at the boy. When the Commander spoke of a <i>&#39;hunt&#39;</i>, it was to his understanding that they would attempt to <b><i>BEAT</b></i> him. Ninjutsu was something that did not earn any bonus points from him. The face of the half-share mirrored this expression with the plucking of a kunai. The kunai of which was gifted to him via Botan moments past.
     <b><i><font color = white>&#34;I want to be FOUGHT, not pelted with jutsu from afar.. This is embarassing&#34;</font></b></i>

Once his dialogue was done and delivered - the hand seals of the boy would be swiftly interrupted with a well placed throw of the kunai. Honing in on the boy with impressive speeds. Once the kunai was thrown, his eyes shifted towards his peripherals, cutting to the gal besides him.

<font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Will you provide me a fight..?!</b></i>&#34;</font>

Sogeki continues to stand firm, even as the Hyuuga approaches. It&#39;s clear.. for some odd reason.. Sogeki has a soft spot for this particular person-- above everyone else at least.

Nevertheless, Sogeki asserts himself further.
  <font color = white>&#34;You ambitions should never stop the goal at hand. The goal at hand-- and the completion of that goal-- should be what drives you closer to your goal. I want you to apologize to yourself for quitting. You were winning.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;How can I drive myself closer to a goal, that I&#39;m a walking contradiction to.. I&#39;m not apologizing for that.&#34;</font> She commented closing the distance towards Najiro and the Commander.

The timer for her Kawarimi had ran out at this point, making her surprise attack on the Commander null and void. She would eventually reach Najiro and extend her hand out expecting him to hand back her medic pouch..

The pouch she intended to use as a substitute for her surprise attack.. <font color = white>&#34;My pouch please, I&#39;m gonna hide.&#34;</font> She beckoned.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) had bought into the sudden flurry of handseals and foolishly presumed her opponent for dead. Mid-sprint, she&#39;d notice a kunai fly past her to intercept the cabbage-boy&#39;s hands before they could finalize the technique.
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. hm.&#34;</font> <i>&#39;Should&#39;ve guessed.&#39;</i>

And now, the Hozuki faced a dillemma. Having ran too far forward, she now lost any reason to allow her ally to engage the Hoshigaki first. What&#39;s more, he had directed the challenge <i>specifically</i> to her, now. Sucking in a breath, she steels her nerves and lifts her fists up in front of her.
   <font color = white>&#34;-Tsk. I don&#39;t think the <b>pray</b> should be talkin&#39; so big!!&#34;</font>

With reckless abandon, she sprints right over the line the half-shark made. Lacking any coherent martial arts or fighting ability, she treated the following encounter with as much grace as any vertically-challenged street rat would; winding haymakers, elbows, and the occasional kick to the knees.
   <font color = white>&#34;<b>C&#39;mon then-!!</b>&#34;</font> [D- striking]</font></font></font>

They spat out the name as they had to abandon the Katon jutsu to drop to the ground as a kunai sailed above his head, almost clipping them with the sharp blade.
<font color = white>&#34;Looks like you will get your fight, Hoshigaki.&#34;</font>
They dashed forward, a decision made in the heat of the moment, looking to close the gap between them as they completely abandoned the use of ninjutsu, a risky move that could either lead to victory or defeat.

Maybe he would try and mingle...but that was here nor there.

The bright male would continue to read about the adventures of the Great Grey Flash. Reading about how he could strike at multiple angles, nearly instantaneously.

Master Matsu's sudden appearance caused, Higane to turn spin her body at the hips, with a small hop and a newly raised center of gravity, she spun counterclockwise and attempted to strike the man in the arm that was holding her.

Two fingers extended outwards as her Byakugan activated, her dagger like blows aiming directly towards the Chakra network that internalized the Commanders ARM.

Thus, his gaze is shined directly upon the lady who appeared to be gunning for him as per instructions.

<b><font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re first then, huh?! Fine then!&#34;</font></b>, he spoke, wasting zero time to lower his arm down towards his knees. Aiming for a block to her incoming strike towards his knee, his smile widnening. The blocking of the strike was done, now it was time for his retaliation.

Stomping his leg down, the half-shark would contort his body in a spinning maneuver as he prepared a kick to hone for her stomach. As it stood currently, this boy could out-maneuver the pair, though little was known if he could <b>over-power</b> the pair.

While everything was going on, he was into a deep reading state..hooked on the book. He would read about the trails that the Grey Flash had to face. Going through a war, losing a loved one, losing a lot of his friends. But in the end....it was all settled with his village as the victor. He would continue to read about how he would become the next kage, lead the village for his remaining years. Before, finally dying of old age.

With a swift motion, he called out to the sharp tooth girl, their voice cutting through the tension. They tossed the shuriken at the hoshigaki, aiming to give the girl some breathing room and keep the fish on the defensive.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) looks down. A strike impacts him and he does little to evade it. It thumps his frame like a plastic nail to steel.

His eyes find the elder Hyuuga, his hand failing to lose it&#39;s grip.

<font color = white>&#34;You will showcase discipline when I am teaching, Hyuuga.&#34;</font>

Their eyes fail to intimidate or force a second thought while his own shift toward the younger Hyuuga.

<font color = white>&#34;To attack me is equivalent to attacking your Kage. You know this much, yes?&#34;</font>

And then it lands- a force of pressure that it would bring simple students to their knees. A quake of <i>raw</i> chakra erupts from the Commander.

                    <b> <i><font color = white>&#34;Everyone cease.&#34;</font></i> </b></font></font></font>

So much seemed to happen in such a short amount of time. Higane being choked, the random Hyuuga elder(?) appearing and her own retaliation to being lifted.

Asa's eyes darted back and forth between the three, then to Sogeki. He wasn't sure whether to act or not. He wasn't even sure if Higane was helpless.</font></font></font>

She sloppily lunges to the right to narrowly avoid the kick, though it leaves her to fall to the ground with a thud.
   <font color = white>&#34;Shit..&#34;</font>

Luckily, her ally had her back! A well-timed set of shuriken would steal their target&#39;s attention, enough to where she can scramble back to her feet--.

<font color = white>&#34;-..&#34;</font> The Commander&#39;s words kill the fight&#39;s growing tension. Slowly, she pushes herself up to address their leader proper.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Sogeki stands in the shadows, the familiar surge of the Commander&#39;s chakra pulses through the campus like an electric storm. Despite the distance, the pressure of the Commander&#39;s presence weighs heavily on Sogeki&#39;s shoulders, causing him to tense involuntarily. His arms remain folded across his chest, a facade of calm amidst the chaos unfolding around him.

Three brash Genin, emboldened by misguided courage or sheer recklessness, launch an audacious attack on the Commander during what was supposed to be a solemn and structured <font color = white>&#34;hunt.&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s eyes narrow slightly as he observes from the shadows, his expression a mix of disbelief and cautious curiosity. He knows the consequences of such a brazen act—consequences that could potentially disrupt the fragile balance of their world.

Despite the chaos and the surge of conflicting emotions within him, Sogeki remains rooted in place. His mind races, calculating the possible outcomes of this reckless action, yet he remains steadfast, his decision clear. He watches silently, waiting to see how the Commander will respond to this unforeseen challenge, knowing full well that the repercussions could shape their futures in ways they couldn&#39;t yet comprehend.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) stood his ground, still not stopping the throttling physically. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll give you the benefit of the doubt, tell me right this second what this kid did.&#34;</font> He said, the veins as visible as ever, though his hands were no longer folded, the seemed to have returned to their sleeves.

It was at this time, when her train of thought was ceasing to exist, and she was fully starting to rely on raw instinct.

<i>Fight or Flight, Endorphins, Norepinephrine, all released by her parasympathetic nervous system</i>

Then suddenly... <i>It all ceased</i>

The jarring sensation of raw energy smacking straight into her scrambled her very thoughts. Was it because she was point blank range? or perhaps because the energy was more focused on her? 

Nonetheless, she seemed to take it worse than the rest of the students.. Her Byakugan shut itself off, the small bed of capilleries and veins simply retracting as her eyes went dull and blank.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Yes, Commander..&#34;</font>, he spoke as his gaze shifted towards the crimson-haired veteran. Should the hunt continue another or not, was ultimately undecided as of now. Nor did it matter much, to him at least. The only slight of this was that.. 
    He was just beginning to have some fun with this.

He squints and makes a decision after brief thought.

<font color = white>&#34;My soldiers are to stand aside and cease their hunt. I have much to make clear.&#34;</font>

A pivot occurs, one last glance given to the Hyuuga before he settles both hands behind his back. He needs not battle.
Only war will call him to stir his chakra so.

<font color = white>&#34;I am second only to the Kage.&#34;</font> A glance given to the Hyuuga jonin. Hopefully a level of understanding is made with that statement alone. <font color = white>&#34;I am your Commander. If you think my forge is too hot then you may exit and never return. Left aside to become coal. Or you can stay and be melted into the <i>sharpest</i> blade.&#34;</font>

He moves towards Nahoko and settles a hand on her shoulder.

<font color = white>&#34;To disrespect me will result in discipline. Nothing else. As I said before, I <b>will</b> lay my life down for my soldiers. I will do it without thought because I am <b>YOUR</b> commander!&#34;</font>

The happy-go-lucky attitude he adopted normally shattered as he let out a hissing breath of, <font color = white>&#34;I swear to fucking god...&#34;</font>

Then out of nowhere, the Hyuuga liften his hand up to hold a sign. He held it up for a solid second, trying to will the victim to react before he did what he was itching to do.

The next second, the unconcious Hyuuga would be forced awake by an activation of his curse mark, <font color = white>&#34;What the fuck are you thinking?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) crossed his arms and furrowed his brow. <i><font color = white>&#34;<b>Our</b> commander?&#34;</font></i> he thought. He was still shaken from the sheer force of his authority alone. How far would he actually go to show that authority? It seemed as though he was willing to seriously maim him and his colleagues. Students fighting is one thing, but nearly choking students out? Punching them with full gusto? It seemed to be a bit much...</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) falls to the floor after being released, in a muffled <i>thud</i>. She lands on her knees slumped over. The young Hyuuga is not fully unconcious but seems to be in a dazed like state.

She lays there slumped over, arms limp at her side..

Unable to <i>react, think, feel or speak</i>

<i>Until....</i>

A jolting headache, one that she has previously experienced before. It sears the back of her eyes like pressing a blazing iron onto the skin of cattle. Suddenly she is forced out of her daze like state by the sheer pain.

Akin to breaking a Genjutsu, Higane could only hold her head with both hands in pain. A curling scream echo&#39;s out of her throat in a ghastly fashion..

<font color = white>&#34;<i>Gyaaaaaaaaah!!!!!</i>&#34;</font> Once again her eyes opened, tears slowly bubbling out of them.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) It was a momentous day for the Hozuki. Earlier this afternoon, she was thinking of who she was going to nab shoes from. Now, all she could think of was the gap in skill between herself and her peers, and the invigorating Commander that led them all. She clutches the bottom of her baggy hoodie and her chest swells with pride as he gives a speech that rouses those listening.

Determined to better herself by and means, she quietly, yet resolutely thrusts her fist up as high as it would go.

He isn&#39;t fast enough to close the distance-- he knows that..

But what he can do is possibly aid in a distraction.
  <font color = white>&#34;..oi, oi..&#34;</font>

Sogeki pushes off the monument, digs into his leg holster, and extracts a set of wooden shuriken. In just a moments notice, the wooden shuriken are sent flying for the attacking Hyuuga&#39;s temple.

     The boy plucked his kunai up, considering the hunt, <i>over?</i> Who knows, it was still undecided and for now, he simply wanted to be done with this - or should the Commander command it - continue having his fun.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>I&#39;m with you, Commander..</b>&#34;</font>, he spoke. Not caring for the transgressions of the past, the half shark was simply continuing on in the now.</font></font></font>

Noticing that there was people on the Commanders side he felt that he wasn&#39;t needed, and would only be a hinderance for them. <font color = white>&#34;well looks like some stuff is about to indeed happen.&#34;</font>

<i>Swoosh, thud... thud...</i>

The set of wooden Shuriken succesfully imbed themselves into Higane's right shoulder, left leg and right arm.

Not a single sound exits her mouth.

He would then change from a flat open palm to more of a gripping hand gesture. Those around him would see for just an instant each individual finger light up purple. The second after, the palm was slammed against the boy's stomach, sealing his chakra usage.

Something is off. There&#39;s malice approaching- No.. There&#39;s revenge drawing close. Who? Where?

Whatever it is, it&#39;s moving a lot faster than what Sogeki can actually keep up with- even with his trained visio.

   ..yet..

A muffled <i>clink, clank</i>

Parts of her black kimono have small torn pieces which expose the skin.. Small trails of blood drip down the three points of injury.

The young Hyuuga, quietly looks around, seemingly assessing the situation once again.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) descended gracefully towards the ground, the rush of air and the exhilaration of movement surrounding him. His keen senses and eagle-like eyesight allowed him to anticipate every detail, every motion around him, as if time slowed down. With precision honed through rigorous training, he prepared to land.

Just as he was about to touch down, an unexpected surge of chakra-infused chains wrapped around his limbs with startling force. His descent halted abruptly, twisting his body mid-air. Sogeki's eyes widened in surprise as he realized he was suddenly restrained, suspended in the air by unseen forces.

The chains held him firmly in place, suspending him above the ground. Sogeki's muscles tensed instinctively, his mind racing to comprehend the situation. Frustration and defiance welled up within him, yet he knew resisting now would only escalate the confrontation further.

Caught in the grip of the chakra chains, Sogeki's breaths came quick and controlled. He grappled with a mix of emotions—frustration at being restrained, respect for the Commander's authority, and a burgeoning sense of understanding the consequences of his actions.</font></font></font>

It would be fair to say he was quite ignorant to the nuances of the Hyuuga clans traditions. Even so, he wouldn&#39;t be happy with them regardless.
