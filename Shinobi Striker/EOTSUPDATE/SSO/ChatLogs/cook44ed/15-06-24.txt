<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) they would notice one more thing though this is something they would have to learn sooner rather than later..

as she aimed to avoid the attack. <font color = white>&#34;u-um..hmm..i think your really beginning to get the hang of this...just one more thing you should know and this is probably the last attack il make. &#34;</font>

She then pivoted back breifly.. allowing the punch to sway infront of her in the air. 

&#39;[Shonen Roll!] 

[Shinobi Flash:[ 

[Roll a d20 as a strike is thrown, delivering a stylish flash. This requires a roll of 16 or higher. This can only be used on a basic Taijutsu or Kenjutsu strike(subject to change). This will lower the enemies endurance a grade for the strike! ]&#39;

She would run forwards and throw a punch in a stylish manner uncharactrictistically of her. She stumbled and fell onto the ground skidding to a stop besides her face first on the matt.  

<i>Crash!</i>

Koume would be seen..twitching..in defeat! [3/4 Defensive!]

&#39;{Shoen rolls can fail as well, though normally the turn goes on as planned im assuming but you lose your offensive action probably]&#39;

&#39;=================== More Information Below =================&#39;

<b> ðŸŽ² SHONEN ROLL ðŸŽ²</b>

<b>Momentum:</b>
Whenever a shinobi moment succeeds, the user can roll again on their next turn to continue the action until they fail. This will also lower the required roll by 1 everytime it succeeds!(This can only be used on SHinobi Flash)

<b>Survival Instinct:</b>
A Shonen Roll can be used to survive an otherwise lethal attack, allowing the player to either escape to fight another day or endure and continue battling. This requires a roll of 10 or higher. Any death resulting from a Shonen Roll failure has a 100% death rate.

<b>Fighting Spirit:</b>
A Shonen Roll can be used to empower a technique, increasing its speed and power by one step. This requires a roll of 10 or higher.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) screamed as she was throwing the punch - she was so close to hitting her one more time. And then came the ominous warning; just what was going to happen next? Should she even keep going with the attack?

Fubuki had no other choice but to keep going and see what happened. It was just a lesson anyways. So she braced herself for the worst and carried her arm forward, her fist however missed her teacher - and now her guard was down, her opponent easily could take advantage of it.

She stared at the Akimichi running at her, for a moment she was dreading it and then--

Koume just fell.

<font color = white>&#34;...A-are you okay?&#34;</font> Fubuki blinked a few times and got closer to give her a hand, helping her get up.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) Would slowly pushed herself up.with her off hand...and...using her free hand to shakingly...taken Fubuki&#39;s.

Once she felt herself standing up fully...she spoke there after!

<font color = white>&#34;morn-...i mean..um..im ok..definately ok...&#34;</font> 

She then laughed a bit akwardly..while...slowly fixing her hair so she could see properly... Perhaps her brain was shaking a bit after the fall...but nothing a good ol rest couldnt fix!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: also thanks for helping me stand up
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was a bit worried at first but in the end she couldn&#39;t help but have a small laugh escape before trying to look serious once more.

<font color = white>&#34;Well as long as you&#39;re okay, it&#39;s all okay.&#34;</font>

She grabbed Koume&#39;s hand and led her outside of the arena, if she wanted to that is. Fubuki would be going anyways.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would be led to the outside of the arena!..though that is when she saw a new face once she centered  her bangs mhm!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) raised a hand in a lazy wave upon being addressed. An overly casual gesture if anything.

<font color = white>&#34;Howdy. Want&#39;n aspirin&#39;? Helps with the whole egg-rattlin&#39;.&#34;</font>

The same hand gestured towards the spot where the black-haired youth had printed her face on the arena tiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) also chose to turn around and wave her hand at the new person, she might as well meet everyone so far. Though something seemed off to the girl.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) hovered uncomfortably close behind the scuffed one.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would say as she pondered for a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;also, im Koume or Cho&#39;kume. Nice to meet you! also..morning Shuye&#34;</font>

As Shuye can see..she was now in a vest!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) gave a roll of her shoulders at the mention of her accent, seemingly not paying much mind to it.

<font color = white>&#34;Aye, ain&#39; the first time someone mentions tha&#39;. Name&#39;s Iroha. Ai-roh-hah. As fer lessons, m&#39;good.&#34;</font>

She made a note of sounding out the name to prevent any future accent misunderstandings. It was about that time she felt the faintest trickle of air against her air, and turned a full one-eighty to see whomst dared enter her personal space.

A one-eyed  squint was offered down at the newcomer.

<font color = white>&#34;Aye? Can ah help ye?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) greeted her with an automatic, reflexive glare. It was the sort of frowning, slightly squinting expression that&#39;d make you wonder, &#39;Is there something on my face?&#39; despite knowing there isn&#39;t anything. Shuye&#39;s vibrantly red eyes flicked fromthe one-eyed girl to the girl behind her and back again. Finally, she leveled a question as the scuffed girl.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you not care at all about keeping yourself safe?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) quirked a brow at the question. She hadn&#39;t yet stepped back, despite the lack of comfortable distance between the two.

<font color = white>&#34;Didn&#39; reckon ah was gonna get shivved&#39;n the streets by m&#39;own countryfolk. Wha&#39;, y&#39;gonna toss a reason t&#39;feel in danger?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked perplexed at that response. <font color = white>&#34;What...?&#34;</font> She muttered, confused. Then, she put it together. <font color = white>&#34;Oh, no. I wasn&#39;t threatening or pranking you. I&#39;m talking about...&#34;</font> She waved a hand at the girl. Surely she didn&#39;t need each and every injury called out by name -- like the missing eye, for example.

<font color = white>&#34;You look like you lost a fight with a bear.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) offered a mild scoff, her good eye narrowing a tad at the mere suggestion.

<font color = white>&#34;First o&#39; all, ah would punk a bear.&#34;</font>

Probably defensive bluster of a mildly wounded pride.

<font color = white>&#34;Second o&#39; all, ah keep as safe as ah oughta. Don&#39; mind the scratches, they don&#39; bother me none.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) quirked a brow.

<font color = white>&#34;A bear is hundreds of pounds heavier than you. Even if you had the strength to crush a rock in your bare hand, it would not compare to bear hands.&#34;</font> She pressed, not caring to protect her pride.

<font color = white>&#34;How did you get them? Perhaps we can take steps to ensure they stop happening.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) pocketed her hands again, ultimately looking a lot more defensive than before. Perhaps even slightly offended.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;make a habit o&#39; pokin&#39; yer nose into everyone&#39;s history? Buzz it, ah don&#39; need yer advise. Wasn&#39; anythin&#39; foresight woulda changed, anyway.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) scowled, and got equally more defensive.

<font color = white>&#34;Only when they&#39;re clearly too helpless to keep themselves whole. It suggests a lack of caring <b>and</b> talent. I wouldn&#39;t want someone to end up like you.&#34;</font>

That&#39;s usually where someone said no offense, but Shuye didn&#39;t.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [aggressive*]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) no longer looked on with mild irritation, rather her good eye shifted to something sharp, and icy. A fury that didn&#39;t reflect in her body&#39;s language. Clearly, the blue-haired girl had struck a nerve of some kind.

She was quiet for a moment, before she turned, and began to trudge off.

<font color = white>&#34;...Aye, me neither. So quit wastin&#39; yer breath&#39;n me. Obviously ah don&#39; know any better.&#34;</font>

The bitterness in her voice was palpable, and it didn&#39;t look like she had any intent to stop her march.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crossed her arms under the weight of that glare. There's no sharp, cutting call after she turned her back and started to walk away; no salt in the wound. Just a deafening silence and mounting of distance between them.

Shuye shifted awkwardly on her foot and looked toward the water instead in contemplation.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) took a sudden glance up above to the character resting themselves upon a rooftop. He wonders to himself how she got up there with ease, which prompts him to stare for... A while.

A few moments pass, before Meixun recognizes that he&#39;s falling into the same trap he always does, so this time: he attempts to speak.

&lt;i&gt; <font color = white>&#34;...ell....ooft....dy...!&#34;</font>&lt;/i&gt; 
Cried out  a sinister voice, a soft wave was given alongside it.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) asks: What's happenin', and why's that person on top of the building?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) peered down from her spot on top of the building, barely catching on to the fact someone was vying for her attention.

<font color = white>&#34;Mm?&#34;</font>

A book was placed in her lap, and a hand kept atop it to keep it secure whilst she looked elsewhere.

<font color = white>&#34;Howdy. &#39;N &#39;cause ah felt like bein&#39; up here, s&#39;all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) asks: H...'d ...ou....t u.....ere?
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Odd place to hang out, but okay.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Climbed. Ain' that hard.
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Just don't jump.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <b>''Just climbed''</b> Huh? Well, it makes sense for lack of a better rate. So, the boy takes up upon the suggested challenge--circling the building with heavy steps in order to scrape up some sort of process to begin climbing up alongside the scuffed girl.
Given that he's significantly younger, shorter, more than likely less experienced than the girl, there's not much of an avenue for him to begin properly. So, the boy settles to moving on the rooftop though the lanturn on the ground. Hopping atop the object to gain some height, crouching down, and cathopping over to the first tiled dome of the roof.

... He doesn't make it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: . . . .ow..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) watched the boy pace around for a moment, wondering if he even could. Well, she got her answer soon enough, and offered a gentle sigh. She did indeed have him beat in age, and experience-- scaling the building was a fairly trivial thing, even if she wasn&#39;t a Shinobi... Yet.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;need t&#39;get a grip&#39;n hoist yerself up.&#34;</font>

Her book was shuffled into a pouch on her flank, and she pushed off the building&#39;s rim, sliding slowly along the angled roof with seemingly little concern for herself. Upon reaching the very edge, she lowered herself, and gripped a hand to the roofing, using that connection to pivot her onto the lower roof, and subsequently onto the ground itself.

<font color = white>&#34;Hard t&#39;do &#39;cause o&#39; the angle&#39;n all, but ye oughta be able t&#39;do it with some practice.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) snickered softly as he watched the light blue haired boy slip and fail trying to climb the building along side of the woman who was on top. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.&#34;</font> he uttered. He moved over to the boy and extended his hand hoping to help the boy off of the ground.
<font color = white>&#34;Geez man, climbin&#39; ain&#39;t for everyone it seems.&#34;</font> he joked.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (ok my internet is stil alive)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) A hiss escapes the boy&#39;s lips, now that the trio was in closer proximity--it seems the lack of explicit wording simply stems from proximity. 
<font color = white>&#34;Thank you very..... much..&#34;</font> He initiated with accepting help offered by the dark-skinned teen, stretching slightly while he utilized the boy&#39;s support to rise up. His face kept a mean streak, peering at both of them for a few moments before fluttering his eyes to speak up again.

Though, now that the girl was right in front of him, nothing short of <i>intimidation</i> fueled his words. She was literally twice his size! Is she a Shinobi? How long has she been in the fields? How much has she been hiding behind the guise of a simple--Questions completely subdued the boy&#39;s words for a much longer period than he&#39;d hope for.

<font color = white>&#34;....! Tall.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) -- The buy had already been picked up. Good. Not that she outwardly projected any empathy for his plights.

<font color = white>&#34;Aye, m&#39;like, twice yer age, probably. Oughta be taller, then.&#34;</font>

She guesstimated, and didn&#39;t really care if she got it wrong. It was mostly a dry joke.

<font color = white>&#34;Try climbin&#39; easier stuff &#39;till ye can reach properly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) pats the boy on the back as he finally got off the ground. Though, Kuni was confused when the boy spoke and said &#39;Tall&#39; his eyes followed to where he was looking at and his eyes landed on the woman from the building and surprising enough she did quite have some height to her. <font color = white>&#34;Huh..&#34;</font> he muttered surprised. He moved over to sized up the woman, looking at her up and down and moving around her body just to gauge how truly tall she was.
<font color = white>&#34;Hm...&#34;</font> he said as he moved around her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: There were not... Many places to grasp.. Without excess..... Perhaps.. The gate could be eas...easier..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) just kind of stood there as she was inspected, seemingly not caring all too much. Given the scarred state of her being, she was most likely used to the occasional squint, and stare.

Of course, a lone eye kept watch of the dark-skinned teen all the same.

<font color = white>&#34;Gate&#39;s cursed fer now. Wouldn&#39; suggest tryin&#39;.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (It has layer issues.)

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Eyup. Oughta prove more yer speed. Some with rocky outcrops t'latch onto.
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Yohkey..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) had just finished up his examination, and just had a few questions for the woman.
<font color = white>&#34;Hm.. What do you eat in a day to day?
What&#39;s the trainin&#39; regimen?
Do you climb often?
Were you born to climb buildings?
Do you really think that kid over there could climb just like you?
Did you stretch before climbing?
Are you in the academy?
Well I guess I&#39;m to late but, what ya name?
Do you have any special climbing gear?&#34;</font>
And thus ended the kids bombardment of questions, hopefully she kept up with them all since all of his questions were important.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) came under assault by a flurry of questions! This caused a measure of surprise, not used to that quantity of things to keep track of. Still, she offered her replies.

<font color = white>&#34;Whatever ah can afford. Usually some combo o&#39; rice&#39;n pork.
Don&#39; got one, really. Just jog &#39;n climb stuff.
Aye.
Nah.
Aye, if he puts in some effort.
Sometimes.
Nay yet.
Iroha.
Just gloves&#39;n boots.&#34;</font>

INHALE. She&#39;d succeeded in one breath, somehow.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: So, you are... not yet a Shinobi..?
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Nope.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) nods along as she surprisingly handles the onslaught of questions he had for her. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m impressed, didn&#39;t think you would answer all of them.&#34;</font> he said with a smile as he extended his palm. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kunigami, nice ta meet ya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) reached out her own hand to complete the shake.

<font color = white>&#34;Ain&#39; like y&#39;were askin&#39; anythin&#39; funky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) gave a revolutionarily hard leer to Iroha&#39;s scars once more, now the question of how she got to where she is now proved to irk his mind. Though, for all intents and purposes--most of all being since she was already bombarded with questions, Meixun held his tongue.

<font color = white>&#34;I.... Am named Meixun....&#34;</font> He concludes, assuming the duo would&#39;ve liked his name as well.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) had felt the aspirant&#39;s presence for a while, though didn&#39;t choose acknowledge it as the youth didn&#39;t seem to be very active. Once the presence began moving; the boy&#39;s eyes glare across to his left.

<font color = white>&#34;He...o.&#34;</font> He announced, obviously stating hello, though his voice doesn&#39;t like to travel it seems.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) lifts a floor bound gaze toward the razor lashed boy and eventually offers a gentle nod. His hand is then raised as it&#39;s balled up into a fist only to float a mere inch away from his lips.

A grunt of sorts escaping him as he cleared his throat, lowering the now relaxing hand.
  <font color = white>&#34;Have you seen a long haired fellow?&#34;</font>, he questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;. . .?&#34;</font> Took a few seconds to prod at his own locks.... Nah, his hair isn&#39;t long enough--his gaze hones on Iroha. Her&#39;s is though.

Releasing his hair, he uses the occupied hand to point over to the scuffed girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) observes the boy's contemplation for a while only to follow to where his inevitable train of thought led him. With the scuffed girl now in sight he'd allow his gaze to linger for a moment.

His lack of change in expression didn't give any clues toward interpretation for what he may have been thinking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) says: . . .
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) eventually shakes his head. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s a male.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f809c>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspiriant-Sushimon) blinks as the razor lashed boy spoke up once more. <font color = white>&#34;...?&#34;</font>
Confused slowly worked it&#39;s way along his visage before he&#39;d step closer once more.
            <font color = white>&#34;---&#34;</font>  -  Before he could speak clearer words from the girl are let loose as she once again gains his attention.

        <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m looking for Yurei.&#34;</font>, he clarified.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) seemed to think for a couple of seconds, a hand rising to her chin.

He&#39;d say offering the both of them a nod. Soon, light footsteps carry him off deeper into the village.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) strolled down the main road to the gate, dark eyes drifting to the two gathered by the gate.

He leapt up to the plateau near him, eyeing the two suspiciously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) gave a bow to the girl before turning on his heels to head toward where he has grown to believe most people are located--or, well the place he last saw his sister.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) turned back towards the building behind her, and knelt down slightly... Only to then jump up, and grab the edge of the roof above her. Despite the slant, she manged to hoist herself up, and once again repeat the process until she ended up on the roof, where she planted her bum on the edge, peering out over the wall.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) shot a suspicious glance at the troubleaker.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The leery boy-T0r1x)

Now that was a good idea. The boy deftly scrambled down the plateau and wandered off into the village.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) wasn't going to let anybody overtake her so easily - her motivation must've boosted her luck somehow, for she once more took over the lead. She glanced at the red-haired boy with a fierce look, this was war.

The toad tried hitting her once more and, instead of either dodging or getting hit full on, it was a graze that made her go a bit slower than usual.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stumbles forward through the suddenly appearing sandstorm. Loudly coughing as his constant shouting made him inhale a bunch of sand.

<font color = white>&#34;Agh!&#34;</font>

He would have to retake his lead later...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) 's motivational boost didn't stop. Somehow she didn't slow down barely from the sand storm. Almost as if she could breathe the sand as regular oxygen. She wasn't doing that though that was stupid, she just covered her nose and kept running, so far getting a lead past everyone.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Was pushed back towards the area, seeing that her brother was miles ahead of her.. she had groaned.. <font color = white>&#34;I can&#39;t loose to him!&#34;</font> She looked a bit angry..she had been pushed back stopping her from getting any closer.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) saw it. A hole in the storm, and a hole between the heckling shrooms. She dove, sliding under an assault, but coming just shy of her intended goal.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) was too distracted with the billowing sand that he didn't see the result of his own cast die.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) felt almost completely confident now that she saw her closest rival stumble back. She grinned confidently.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m winning! I&#39;m going to w-&#34;</font>

Then a toad hit her right on the face, causing her to roll back to right where she was. She still had a lead, but for how long?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) -- Another slide. Another unpleasant landing. But she got further! Third place?!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) regains his composure and begins staggering forward. Finally getting the sand out of his lungs before shouting in response to his sister.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The leery boy-T0r1x) kept running forward, but was surprised to see a toad had caught up with him. A strong push slowed him down, but he continued to make a little progress.</font></font></font>

Due to her overly competitive nature, Fubuki took it seriously once more and began running even more. There was an even greater distance now with everyone else.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a light muffled laugh.

She paused as her eyes stared at the growing fubuki who was in first palce.

<font color = white>&#34;her body lowers at a 90 degree angle to allow the air current to pass her..from above.&#34;</font> 

<font color = white>&#34;the air..rose up at a angle to block the side lash of sand grains before rushing forwards.&#34;</font> She paused. <font color = white>&#34;hwoever..it was then...she was hit at her side..being  knocked back...you see...she is currently in the zone..but hasent fully entered it yet..&#34;</font>

She paused as she looked back to the blond lad and shook her head. 

<font color = white>&#34;they call it..the imperfect zone...baring into the doors..without being accepted fully by those already whom entered it. &#34;</font> She paused. <font color = white>&#34;its why Iroha is catching up to them...lets see if its not a fluke..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was moving at a slower pace now, the further she got towards the end the harder it was to move. She was making progress but soon enough she&#39;d have to go faster.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw behind her the boy who was now threatening to be first. She couldn&#39;t allow it. Never! She began running more and more, she was still the closest towards the finish line.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) scrambled back on her feet, seeing the leery boy nearly overtake her! Over her dead body, she would let him! Now they were neck, and neck.</font></font></font>

It was nothing more than a pebble, really, about the same width as his finger. Hardly any real injuries would come of enduring a strike from such. But...

Keen eyes narrow upon the girl in front, the one with the light-purple hair. A whip of arm launched a pebble right for their forehead.

Managing to just barely slip away from her and continue jogging after the others. If that kid kept throwing pebbles... Maybe Hideo could actually win?!

He points and shouts to the blond boy.</font></font></font>

The Scuffled looking girl. He picked up a soggy looking stone that felt comfortable in his palm. A nice weight. Not heavy enough to severely bludgeon. Just chunky enough to smart. He aimed for their shin this time around. A try at tripping them up, as it were.

She halted before him, surprised to find someone actually her height, and age amongst the crowd of young teens.

Aiming. Aiming. Err. Exactly how would someone place words to an explanation like that? Internal questionings surfaced in the wrinkle of brow while he pondered. Uh... 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nothing special. It&#39;s not something someone can really teach as much as it is something your body learns. You just have to throw a lot. I&#39;ve been throwing things ever since I learned how to close my fingers around objects, so..&#34;</font>

He paused to pluck up a flat stone. A whip of arm sent it spiraling like shuriken for the moat water. It skips a grand total of seven times before hitting the distant northeastern moat-wall with a solid clack!

<font color = white>&#34;.. practice makes perfect?&#34;</font>
He shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: In short? I throw by feel. That sounds about right. Instinct.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: Eat and--- Those are just things everybody does to live!

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: If you would like to try some throwing drills later... I guess I wouldn't mind setting up some targets. 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Daddy, do ya have any money?
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Sure. Ah can actually buy some throwin' equipment now.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You need minerals and stuff in your diet.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: See-- wait?!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Why would you do that?!

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: So you can learn how bad it is to eat rocks.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a laugh.
<font color = white>&#34;A decent way of looking at it. So. Did you get held back a year or two? Or.. did you get a late start?&#34;</font>

A moment&#39;s spent gazing across the moat, at all their peers, before refocusing on the tall one. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the latter. I gave up on learning my family&#39;s... <i>primary business</i> to do this. Never too late to start learning how to do violence for profit. Right?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh, not too sure what I like doin' for fun.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrm.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) kept silent for a moment, almost as if she was considering her answer, before she replied with an idle shrug.

<font color = white>&#34;Likewise fer me. Couldn&#39; walk fer a year. That didn&#39; help. But ah got better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) takes a deep breath and and exhales.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) blinked a few times before looking the boy up and down.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned at Venturo. Then she turned to her brothjer.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t let me catch you eating rocks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Eat as many rocks as you want...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) takes a step back and stands next to Meixun and nudges his awake.
<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be fallin&#39; asleep out here, dude. You might get eaten.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) eyes her up and down returning the energy.

<font color = white>&#34;Ill give you an allowance and you&#39;ll get to make me sandwhiches. That sound good?&#34;</font> He asks with a grin.</font></font></font>

While Shuye is temporarily keeping her attention off of him, he gives a few 'knowing' winks over toward the other kid's way. He has NO idea who he even is, but he's convinced himself... He will show the fellow kid the way before too long.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Reilin!  I will adopt you for sandwiches!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) tilted his head. Err. Couldn&#39;t walk for a year-- 
Yeah, that sounds like the kind of personal matters anyone with basic common decency shouldn&#39;t ask about. So he didn&#39;t!

<font color = white>&#34;I see. Well. Best of luck to you, in your future laden with dodging rocks for the rest of the year. I won&#39;t go easy on you, if the legal opportunity finds me again,&#34;</font> he told them, wearing an unseen grin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: My new wife is making us all sandwiches..Just put your order in!

He could continue deeper if he'd wish, though it'd more than likely lead him to some unnecessary detailing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s listened to the offer given before taking a short breath. Just as she exhaled, her once somber demeanour had changed. Her eyes were piercing as she looked toward the boy.

Her once prim-and-proper way of speaking had vanished at the drop of a hat and she&#39;d tilted her nose up, even if she were shorter she found a way to still look down her nose at the boy.
