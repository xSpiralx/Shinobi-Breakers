He gives her a playful touch on the arm as if he thought he was being loving and romantic..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Ill take my buns toasted, extra mayo with bacon and chopped chicken.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Tomatos, and add a little pepper.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) yells: Toasted Buns!!!!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Buns...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Beef Bacon in between...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) looked towards the red eyed girl and scratched his cheek.
<font color = white>&#34;Er.. I&#39;m just makin&#39; sure he ain&#39;t sleepin&#39; on the job, that&#39;s all lady.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Mn...&#34;</font> The boy grunts in discomfort, someone is holding back. Or, worse yet: <i>somebody knows he&#39;s searching for them.</i>

Shuye&#39;s words pierce through his concentration just before he attempted to trudge deeper.
<font color = white>&#34;Mnh? O-Oh!.&#34;</font> He acknowledges Kunigami with a bow, clasping his hands together in the process. His eyes burn into the two-tone head&#39;s face for a second, just for a second though--a rare occasion on his part.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: OOOH  IDea...  What if we do like CHEECE TOASTED STUFFED TOASTED BUNS?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave them a nod and left it at that.
Now then...

...what's going on over there? He's finally free to focus on the chatter. People-watching and such. He took a seat on the arena's edge, listening in on this talk of sandwiches and holy matrimony(?). </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Eh. cheese, sorry I blanked out.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: All this food talk, someone's about to owe me a meal after this if it keeps going...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) waved her hand in front of the dark skinned not-quite-teen.

<font color = white>&#34;What job?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) closed her eyes, a vein buldged across her forehead -- though hidden by her bangs. Her irritation had reached its limit and although this boy didn&#39;t mean any harm she found his words to be truly demeaning. How dare he try bossing her around? That was her job.

<font color = white>&#34;You idiot!&#34;</font> she barked. With a clenched fist she sought to bonk the boy on the head. While she didn&#39;t really have any strength behind the punch, if it hit it&#39;d probably leave a lump on his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll never marry ya&#39;! Tha&#39; person I marry would know that -I&#39;m- tha&#39; prize damnit!&#34;</font> Reilin exclaimed.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) placed a hand on his hip and tilts his head to the side.
<font color = white>&#34;The job ta be ready whenever an enemy invades the village, woman.&#34;</font> he told her plainly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept up her scowl, unamused.

<font color = white>&#34;He doesn&#39;t even have a headband. He has no job.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She's got a point! Sh- Er, both of the girls talking right now I guess.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) pondered if she should kick him into the moat, just to get revenge from earlier, but figured it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea.

Well, it was, because she&#39;d come up with it, but it would come with a degree of future revenge, probably.

<font color = white>&#34;Have fun with that. M&#39;gonna go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: NO for real......Whos making those sandwhiches.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was completely off guard as he was continuing to take orders and was decked with a &#39;powerful punch&#39; that sent him flying.

<font color = white>&#34;--Gaaaaaaahhh!&#34;</font>

He slams on the floor while skidding slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hrngh..Ouch..Y-you&#39;re the prize??&#34;</font>

He grunts as he raises up to his feet, rubbing the afflicted area.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay okay..I think I get it..Ill buy you an apron before you get to making the sandwhiches...And a hair net!&#34;</font>

(Damage taken!)</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Don't worry..she's making the sandwhiches!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..Ouch..what a punch..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) moves over and stares the Uchihue into the eyes!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a great prize, mhm mhm.&#34;</font>

Hmmm, sammiches sound good though.

The spider girl would side step away again as she stares up at the sky.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: The wonders of youth...but arent you a bit to young to be asking girls to become housewives.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) had a strong suspicion they would try to push him into the moat too. Weird that they didn't.
<b>The Fūma would remember this.</b> Perhaps he would go easy on her the next time the opportunity to throw blunt objects at faces arose. 

Either way, he continued to sit there, with a water bottle in hand. Idly taking sips. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Oh.. so I am not the only one that thought having a sword is cool..?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Indeed.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: So imagine not one but TWO swords.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Also, can the spider folk even fight well with swords? Their arms would constantly be on the way.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) wandered towards the edge of the moat, and seated herself with her legs dangling above the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Plenty things t&#39;do&#39;n yer downtime.&#34;</font>

Speaking of, she produced a book from the pouch on her flank, and flipped it to a page with a bookmark.

<font color = white>&#34;Ain&#39; like we&#39;re soldiers yet, anyway.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yet, soon we might be though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Not yet no
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Well if I get placed on a team with either of you. I'll try to help cover you with my doton
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll bonk people with my swords, when I get them.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Mm. Probably won' be leavin' the village on missions fer a long time. Oughta look into a different squadmate than me.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wouldn't mind having either of you as squadmates.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Gettin' 'long don' mean much if yer squaddie ain' good fer fightin', 'n ah'm tellin' ye, ah probably won' be fer a hot minute.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: This shit's so complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Neither will I, I dunno how to use a sword much less two. Meanwhile people are gonna throw fireballs and shit.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Elemental jutsu is foundational to combat.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah. Imma not use it though.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Won' have the time t'learn any.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Why is that?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I wanna focus on swords instead. No time to learn much else.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) squinted.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) nodded.

<font color = white>&#34;Maybe if only I used one sword, but if I wanna use two? Probably.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (Elemental*)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i thought it was on purpose bc of her accent lol)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ishii, Iroha(The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) OOCs: (That's the true superpower of writing an accent. People can never tell.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned. So many people were medically inclined, it was almost shocking. At least there would be no lack of colleagues...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: How're things you all?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: 'Kay I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Fine.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Hi.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Think Raku's still asleep.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Is anyone training today?
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Nay right now, clearly.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'm more a book reader than a trainer.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Books are a good way of training the mind.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Likewise.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) was in fact, reading right in this moment, holding a book in one hand, and scribbling notes on a little pad with the other. All while sitting dangerously on the edge of the moat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I'm done with my meat-cutting for the day, I was hopin' to get into somethin' less dull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) walked up behind the white-haired person, peeping in to see what they were reading without invading their personal space.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn&#39;t appear to care much for the approaching youth, and simply continued to study. It quickly became apparent she was was reading about everyone&#39;s favourite topic of treatment methods for various kinds of fungal infections. In this particular instance, stomach infections, and all the not-so-pleasant symptoms, and how to quell them.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Fraid ah ain&#39; known t&#39;be much fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) shook his head, medical studies were an interesting topic. He began to see different roots praised for their antifungal properties and ailments which could be caused by an infectious encounter with them.
 Truth be told, he had no real idea what he was looking at, but caught the gist.

   Turning around to face north he speaks out while sitting on the ground.
<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s like a general goods man, has his hands in different things. Some of the meat will go to our home, some will be sold.&#34;</font> Yurei describes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn't look particularly happy with the topic, but what could she do. Hunkering down, and learning it was a simple requirement if she wanted to excel, even if studying definitely wasn't a fun occasion for her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crossed her arms. She thought about whether to keep asking him things about it, but instead shared about herself--

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m a vegetarian.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: So what you eat plants?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Well, not just plants. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...Actually, yes, just plants. I guess fruit are technically from plants. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) wrinkled her nose as the dust storm rolled on in, and called it a day for studying.

<font color = white>&#34;...Oughta get a pair o&#39; goggles.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: .... so dujsty.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: I get it, does it get boring?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Ugh, my eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Not to me! You can use a lot of different toppings.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked distant--

<font color = white>&#34;You don&#39;t want to know what too much meat does to you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shields himself from the raging dust and begins to make his way off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns, equipped with a straw hat on his head and another in hand. In a swift motion he'd look to offer the other to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes the hat and then places it on top of his head to wall the dust from his face.
  <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, Raku, what a surprise.&#34;</font> He stated with a smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods and parts his lips to speak once more.
  <font color = white>&#34;I spoke to a higher-up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Did they give you orders to get us hats?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: They said we may have the power to surpass the Shogun.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: The Mugen clan is that strong?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm not sure..
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Are we a clan?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Kind of, but kind of not.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: To be able to surpass the Shogun, you'd have to be stronger than strong.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Why would you even want to do that? 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: i kinda like the idea of peace area to meet other people in the future.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Not real sure.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I feel like the Shogun is one-hundred years old.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I was told that even he can bleed.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: And just as energy recycles, so does power.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I don't think I want power, Yurei.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) nuzzled his mouth lower into the collar of his hoodie as the dust storm raged across the village. Just another day in Iwagakure.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Ishii, Iroha has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Mmh...
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: M'gonna be back'n a bit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) returned! Now wearing a pair of goggles so she wouldn't have to squint.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It storms quite a bit...it's really annoying. I can't see shit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) shot a quick glance at his peers talking before shrugging and returning to his coin.

<font color = white>&#34;We have to be comfortable in it. If we&#39;re used to it, our enemies will have quite a hard time attacking us here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What if they wear goggles?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Doubt they could even make it through the front door.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Thank god it's over...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hello, hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) head flicks upward as the sandstorm subsides. <font color = white>&#34;Mm..&#34;</font>, he hums to himself as he&#39;d became lost in thought. Eventually, he&#39;d tuck away the straw hat in his void like confines and began to make his way off.

   <font color = white>&#34;Library.&#34;</font>, is all he says to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How's it goin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) uses a line of twine to rope the straw hat to his backside before heading west after a while.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=red>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sup, nothing really going on.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Oh hello Reilin
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just staring at this arena, and the water.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Sounds like a buzzkill to be honest.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nothing else to do until we get a class honestly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (everytime the game lags before i post i have the fear i mischannel'd or some shit)

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Class?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: What do ya' need class for?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Taijutsu, shurikenjutsu and eventually kenjutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ooh.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmm, I myself will be using Katon, shurikenjutsu and well I haven't thought of anything else just yet
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Shurikenjutsu sounds like a great place to start.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I just wants swords, man.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Using kenjutsu would be a lot of fun but I can't really spread myself too thin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, fair enough. I dunno how much I'll use ranged weapons anyways. I prefer to get close to my enemies.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Well that's good to know, if we ever go on any missions together that is.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Damn kdis
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Eh?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Who're you, Gramps?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) squints, <font color = white>&#34;Who said that? Wher&#39; ar&#39; ya&#39;?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) turned around towards the merchant and raised her hand.

<font color = white>&#34;Me, who&#39;re you gramps?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: He looks old
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Probably doesn't have much going for em
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) looks over at the red afro girl, <font color = white>&#34;Old? Look here young man! Mind your elders!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: You're right, they really do look like a boy...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) sniffs the air, <font color = white>&#34; The smell of Dog piss...I&#39;m still i Iwa then? I thought I left..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Sup.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: ...Dog piss?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: The Inuzuka clan doesn't seem to have any one in our age group. But. They do have dogs.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Don't ya smell that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, must be nose blind.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: *Hmph* Must be se to smelln' it then
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Sticks her tongue out at the old man. The girl had blinked a few times.. before offically responding towards him. <font color = white>&#34;Mind my elders? I don&#39;t even know you, and you should get your eyes checked old timer. I am not a man or a guy, I am frankly surpised someone as old as you is still alive..&#34;</font> She groaned, before turning her attention to her brother. The girl moved over towards his side. <font color = white>&#34;Hey nii-san.&#34;</font> She said standing before him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Wha'cha doin' here, Gramps?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: He's probably here to visit a tailor.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches with amusement as his younger sister roasts the strange old man. As she approaches, he reaches out and moves to lightly karate chop her. Tapping her head with his hand as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Himeki. Who&#39;s the old guy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) mumbles, <font color = white>&#34;Damn snot nosed brats,&#34;</font> to himself before closing his eyes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times as she shifted her attention towards him. She had gently grabbed his hand.

<font color = white>&#34;What ya doing? And I have no idea, he seems rude.&#34;</font> She had said before saying.

<font color = white>&#34;Another game of 200?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (And buying my first core)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Haha, this old guy is pretty funny.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Rest well, Gramps.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm, if you need anything mister let us know.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm not doing anything yet. Pretty quiet morning so far. Did dad give you more money to bet with? Cause I was serious yesterday! Tired of playing two-hundred and betting with cool rocks...
<br><font color=green>*Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) arrives.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: No
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hey, Kaido. How're you doin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) flicked the sticky coin he had produced across his fingers once more, taking in the situation quietly with a wandering violet gaze. A dark eyebrow would be raised at the grumpy old merchant.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) nods at Rellin and lets out a huge sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhh I&#39;m doing pretty good you know. Getting better, going to be the greatest in my specialization one day heh. How are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) begins counting his ryo over, becoming increasingly proud of his earnings.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) finally removes his hand from atop her head and stuffs it into his pocket. Sighing as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Then we&#39;re not gonna play two-hundred. Rolling dice just to roll dice isn&#39;t fun...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: yI need to make some money, who's got some?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: *I*
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll give you 100 ryo if you give me 200 ryo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) eyes panned between the collective. Silently observing his soon to be peers as the intereact with one another and form indepenent fractions. At this moment all he required was some form of indication of who was in charge. He wasn't sure if the village had an active chuunin nor Jounin.

But it was probably wise to keep a close eye on every's attire. Maybe there he'd be able to parse out the officials from the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances at the light purple haired girl.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not even pretty enough to talk to, go make me a sandwhich.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirled her hair around her index finger idly while she conversed. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. I think I&#39;ll be the best in mine as well. Make sure you don&#39;t fall behind.&#34;</font> she said with a light chuckle.

<font color = white>&#34;Care to share what your specialization will be, or are you one of the people who like to keep secrets?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll keep it a secret for now!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) raised an eyebrow at the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Why would I do anything for you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Man, secrets are lame. Isn't she supposed to be your wife or whatever too? That's gonna be a tough marriage...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances back at the girl.

<font color = white>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t you? You&#39;ve got two hands and I forgot to do the dishes at home. Chop chop!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll tell you in private later Rellin!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Eh, pay me 100 ryo and I'll do it.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Happy wife happy life.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I was just saying that before, you're not pretty enough to pay.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: You should be happy I'm even talking to you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Really? I think she's pretty pretty.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Then marry her.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, I gotta get rich and famous first. Maybe later.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How are you going to get famous?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Throwing mountains at people.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) gave a thumbs up at Hideo before looking at the other boy before.

<font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re not gonna pay me, I won&#39;t do anything for you, simple as.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) quickly returns the thumbs up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Darn, I coulda had a maid..
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) asks: ...Anyone even got cash 'sides what we earned from the race?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Why would you want an ugly maid? Get your priorities straight before you get cash.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I'll through you at people.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shaked her head.

<font color = white>&#34;I got first place and I&#39;m still kinda broke.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Tragic.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She totally did...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Yeah. Is that supposed to be a good amount?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Ayyo, lemme hold wo hunnid ryo.

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrm.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: How far away am I from a sword? That's all I care about.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Kinda want to play again
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: For double the money
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I missed the games.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I 'unno, swords are pretty expensive I think.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: 'Bout, like, two-thousand-somethin'.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Fuck. Well, I'll get there one day.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Fer a small one.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Shit man, fuck.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You know, you curse a lot. That's pretty cool.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Two thousand for a Katana?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Wow.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I 'unno what sword I even want, I wish I had a teacher to help me.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Name o' the weapon ye dolt.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: O-Oh, I knew that.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I just had the strong urge to rob someone.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: But that would be wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Very wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah man robbing people is messed up.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just don't get hit on the head.
