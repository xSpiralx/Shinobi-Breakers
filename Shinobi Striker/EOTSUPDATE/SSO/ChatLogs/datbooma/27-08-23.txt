<font color = white>&#34;Hey, that girl&#39;s a Shininijobi or whatever, right?&#34;</font> He aims to clarify, since Sakuya&#39;s been outside longer than he has, perhaps she was present whenever Komo demonstrated some sense of skill.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t seem to care about the formal attire of his cousin, not even their young age. It should be pretty standard for Uchiha&#39;s to have some geniuses every now and then, and he was curious as to what Kohaku was capable of.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh trust me, I spotted quite a few promising... if not interesting, people already.&#34;</font> If both Kohaku and Batsu followed his gaze, they would see him glancing at Might, Try and then at both Hajime and Shishorama talking near the police officer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) eyes did not change from his normal blank, bored expression. Was this some kind of prank? His cold black eyes merely looked at Try, unblinking.

<font color = white>&#34;Support? Uh...Are you feeling okay?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: OH YEAH!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: ou're not that strong are you?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Never better Raihara. Why?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Yes, legends of the village would say I have a hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Cuz today starts our shinobi adventure! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) delicately shakes his hand with the appropriate amount of strength. She took great care not to actually harm her future comrades and classmates. It was her duty to protect those weaker than her, and she&#39;d uphold that belief until the bitter end.

<font color = white>&#34;When I win, I&#39;ll treat you to some food after.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: No reason...Nevermind it.
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: It looks like it.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: We should meet some of the other students.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) Kohaku didn&#39;t look much younger than Batsu, wondering just what he meant by feeling out of place. It felt natural for the Uchiha himself to finally become apart of the academy after the years of waiting. He&#39;d nod toward his clan member though, a head nod that usually gestures a greeting.

The statement about passing though the academy would resonate with him though, he&#39;d already expected the academy to be something he could easily maintain as his parents had made him study for as long as he could remember.

<font color = white>&#34;Pleasure to meet you Kohaku and yes... We will indeed exceed in this years academy.&#34;</font> he said, smirking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: But there are so many.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) asks: Do you want to have a hard ass head too? Or you just wanting to give it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) clicked her tongue, and idly produced a book from within her garment. Adding a pen to the mix, she began to scribble down on a seemingly blank page. Mysteries upon mysteries were written, surely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Well, I can introduce you to a few.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hummm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) scoffed at the declaration that he&#39;d beat herself and the other one. So, she did what anyone else in her position would. Push his buttons even harder.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... I&#39;ll just verbally agree to beat you then, I wouldn&#39;t want to touch your hand...&#34;</font> Her nose upturns just a tad, as though she would have caught something being too close to him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) stepped up to Kohaku and put his fists on his hips as he stared intently at the Uchiha trio just... breathing... waiting.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Already making friends?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (dont mind my fists on your hips)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stands behind Try, his cold eyes just examining the three students before him. He would not make any introductions.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Medical Nin are quite excellent at giving hard ass he-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) reachs out and touches Shun&#39;Ichi green hair without permission. <font color = white>&#34;Is this natural?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) covers her mouth... She forgot she was with children.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had no idea that he had been held back on.

He simply figured that despite being part of the Senju, she was a girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;No way. I don&#39;t accept hand outs.&#34;</font> 

Despite Hinoue&#39;s clear reluctance, he steps forth and raises a fist towards her, to seek a fist bump. Defiant eyes lock onto her own. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ...And I'd never lose to you, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: ....... Don't worry about that! Answer my question, is that sword girl a ninshija?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (Does this game function like most nrp)

<font color = white>&#34;You... can simply say hello, Try.&#34;</font> He was very much as interesting as his cousin stated him to be, how refreshing and out of the box. A chuckle escaped him, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Uchiha, Kohaku... How are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Hello Kohaku!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) had found themselves engrossed, reading over the orphan&#39;s shoulder. Who would&#39;ve thought a novel like this could be so attention grabbing?! She wanted to see if the hero would successfully save the kidnapped heroine!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m done with that page. Turn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yells: Ah--- She got away!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Because I've always found a way.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm great! This heart of mine is raging like a wildfire in the peak of summer!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I'm here with Hatake Raihara.

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You should really try to be a little cooler, Try.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Positivity is good for the morale of others, so that's a good thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) cocks her head toward Kohaku as she hears her name being mentioned. "You wanted to talk?!'</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) spared a glance over toward Komo. Upon realizing that the older woman was insistent on tomorrow&#39;s start date, she clicks her tongue. Stepping further down the path, she turns her attention out toward the gathering.

<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) saw Might Try approaching that the Hatake kid from before. <font color = white>&#34;Hey, I&#39;m Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font> He extend a fist for a bump. <font color = white>&#34;Hatake, Raihara, right?

     The main character's training montage would continue, but would they be successful?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Uchiha, Senju, Hyuuga...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Wait-- did the lady with a normal sized vocabulary say something about money?

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (And I get a hatake to be my hot blooded rival)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Her statement seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as the optimistic one rapidly approached with a fist held out, intent on connecting some type of gesture that was evidently foreign to her with the confusion crawling across her visage. So, what could she do except from taking an offensive stance?!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to fight me right now?&#34;</font>

Legs set further apart, bending ever so slightly at the knees as all digits furl upon both hands - only for the index and middle to extend in an untrained stance. Unique to her lineage.</font></font></font>

Far from impressed with her polished combat stance that had been handed down across generations, he seems shocked, apalled even. He leans back a tad, as if now -he- were the one who could catch something from her.

He turns to face Kyoko on that note, and takes a step away from the Hyuuga, turning his back towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll play.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

  She pulled out an attachment, a small spade like object that she wiggled into place on the top of her staff. The tool now resembles a hoe.

<font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Konoha&#39;s academy course. Ya&#39;ll be training to be shinobi that defends the lands of Fire, we shinobi are the heartline of this nation - Just like farmers.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Instead of feeding mouths, we shinobi solves and prevent those farmer&#39;s problems from interrupting them making harvest.&#34;</font>

A hand extended facing the handed tool, as it suddenly came back to her grasp. <font color = white>&#34;To do that, we practice and master the use of all life force Chakra. Before we git to all that...&#34;</font>

The woman places the hoe back to her rear, facing the memorial.

<font color = white>&#34;This memorial is what we call tribute, tribute to all the shinobi that has succeeded their limits for their nation, some giving up their lives for you to even breathe and be born.

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That would've taken ages.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) snaps her finger into a thumbs-up.
<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;d have stepped forward. Good work.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) forces an awkward smile and glances away. 

<font color = white>&#34;N-no problem... My turn...&#34;</font> 

Friend??????? Someone had called him friend????????</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Uh oh.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I can't believe you would be so willing to count all those for me!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Y-yeah... That's what...friends do... Haha...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Okay.. ninety..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Even if we just met... 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How do I get that out of D-twenties?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: That's an odd number.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's nine tens.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: You have tens too?!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: He wouldn't carry all of those dice if he wasn't willing to count them...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: The D-20s have 10s within.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Officer, I think he might be doing an illegal dice operation.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: He's got way too many!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hmm..! Now that you mention it, it's a biiit odd..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's even too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: He's got odds and evens.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) couldn&#39;t believe it.

He gulps.

Was he about to take advantage of Hanako? He simply cannot look in her direction...Until she snitches on him to the police. He tenses, glancing at the dice, before he glances up at Kyoko.

<font color = white>&#34;N-no way! These aren&#39;t stolen..! I can definitely afford these dice on an oprhanage allowance... They&#39;re super used, see?&#34;</font> 

He sweats.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Sounds like it evened out, then.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Proceed.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It did. He's clean.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: ...An orphan? I see. That's unfortunate.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why so?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) scooped up the provided tens!

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry I doubted you! At first, it seemed a little odd, I will admit! But! Everything was even-stevens.. so..! Now to throw nine of these bad boys. Hyup!&#34;</font> 

She tossed them!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Because to my undestanding, a loving set of parents is ideal in raising a strong child.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Let's see.. if I put them all in rows of their numerical value and then count up the rows and multiply them by themselves and add up the results I get...!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ... ninety-two. That can't be right. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) turns towards Kurorama with a squint.

<font color = white>&#34;You callin&#39; me weak?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hum.. did I forget to carry a number?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Guess I'll count them the tried and true way..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: One.. two.. three..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Fourty-one.. fourty-two.. fourty-three..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) offeres a shake of her head.

<font color = white>&#34;No. Just that you&#39;ll have a harder time reaching the same plateau as your peers.&#34;</font>

For someone that boasted excellence in the wordy-stuff, she sure was sharp with her tongue. Though, it didn&#39;t seem like she&#39;d intended any offense.

<font color = white>&#34;Your apparent chosen rival is a Senju, is she not? That&#39;s quite a steep mountain to climb.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) leans over to snatch one of the dice from the tiled floor after the blonde tossed and counted them. Veins produce from her forehead as her pupils come into focus, staring intently at the die! Fingerprints, how often they were used- not a detail went overlooked.

<font color = white>&#34;.. Hrmm.. scuffed-up, and-.. cheaply made?&#34;</font> Her viseage goes lax as she tosses the D-20 back down. <font color = white>&#34;If he stole them, I doubt anyone cares.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [very well, sub 20, 70..]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [roll a d20 for new value]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) <font color = white>&#34;Chosen rival?&#34;</font>

He leans back a tad, and his resentment vanishes. He stares at her absent-mindedly for a few moments.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t have a chosen rival. I&#39;m going to be the best.&#34;</font> He states, bluntly, before finally returning to the game.

<font color = white>&#34;That means, beating everyone else. Clan, or no clan. No exceptions.&#34;</font>

A faint sigh leaves his lips in relief as he realizes that he was not about to be hauled in by the po-po.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright..! Hanako, you done counting? My turn yet?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Kyouko(The police chief-DatBooma) OOCs: (smh..
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [roll a d20, officer!]
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hmm.. eighty-six.. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No.. eighty-four..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ah, then, I must have mistaken Shishorama's intent.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. yep.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: Oh, dang! Good roll!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I count eeighty four!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) hadn't realized she changed a die's value.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Your turn!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Got it..!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Just because Shishorame wants to make me her rival or something, it doesn't mean she'll be mine.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I must believe in the heart of the dice to win, it seems.....
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, wow. That's like.. five-six-ten, uh.. nineteen.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: It gets easier the smaller the rolls, huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) counts the dice multiple times, to ensure that he had in fact, gotten the right number. Also, to look for cheating opportunities.

None presented themselves..!

A smile is forced as he nods.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah. When someone loses, it&#39;s super easy to tell...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Got it! Okay.. time to roll this.. big handful of dice.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Let's go..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: ..!!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Heh..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Twelve. That's a good number.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: I agree!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) yells: That's an awful number!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: It's the amount I'd have if I got that extra dollar!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: That extra ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Unless you -lose.-
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: -..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) smiles triumphantly.

What were the odds of that?!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, wow. He's really good at this.. 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Do you get bonus points for rolling the same number?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ack.. I tried!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: He skips a roll, more or less.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: To your pride, you do.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Wow.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Oh.. what happens if we both hit the same one?
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: I'm amazed someone like you has pride.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Pride is healthy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Kyouko(The police chief-DatBooma) OOCs: (more like slander noble..
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Pride is a disease.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Someone like me?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kyo(The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) OOCs: (Slander noble..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: What do you mean?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) checks the skin tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Pride Schmide! Let's keep going! 
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: A cracker.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Give me.. a three!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) sloooowly inched her sandal towards the dice, preparing to give it a nudge. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kyo(The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) OOCs: (Walk into MY village, call ME a cracker, fuck MY bitches 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) crosses her legs as she sits down, retrieving a flask from her haori.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) watches that one come, with glee. With joy. Finally, he would get the ten ryo that he had so desperately wanted.

Another successful hustle! Another successful bamboozle!

He extends a hand towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game, Hanako. Pay up. You get to keep your one special ryo, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) yawns. The nap he had was nice.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) asks: Hold it. Are you children gambling?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Congratulations.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) produced ten crispy (slightly moistened) bills from her stack. 
<font color = white>&#34;Yes..&#34;</font> 

A brush of thumb fans them out like playing cards. She takes her time inspecting their faces, their authentication codes as per mint standard, admiring their old-man faces. Reflected in their pale green eyes, she could see all the precious memories that brought them together; playing a complicated red-light green-light, and..

    ...and... 

.. actually, that&#39;s about it! Yep. Participation reward, and then the dive into her pocket because she had to go hear a speech. Good times. The best of times. She extended the bills to their new owner, entirely lacking in sadness, despite this departure. 

How could she feel disappointment, seeing the other kid look so giddy over receiving these funds?! Haa. That&#39;s probably the exact same face she wore when she first acquired them. Right?

<font color = white>&#34;.. take good care of these. Remember how good it feels.. to receive ten ryo. Take it from me. I&#39;ve learned.. it&#39;s a feeling that does not last forever.&#34;</font>

Winds thread through her blond locks as she turned her gaze to the sky, akin to a meditative Bodhisattva arriving at an epiphany. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I see. This decision has caused a severely traumatic scene to unfold.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Halt this.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Gamble with pretend money.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Boy, if you accept those funds, I will punish you thusly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) nods her head, content with the extended threat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Ehh? Aren't all funds made up?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: They're just paper someone drew faces and numbers on!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Besides. He's my friend, so I don't mind if he has them! We'll call it payment for playing a game with me.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: Pretend money has no value in the real world.
<br><font color=green>*Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) says: That is a bad mindset, girl.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) &#39;s eyes remain transfixed upon Hanako&#39;s demeanor and her apparent relationship with these bills, that had been acquired after such hard toil, a fierce game of red-light, green-light that was overly complicated but extremely fun. Even so, upon seeing the way that she stares at the money, he simply cannot feel as giddy and elated as he wanted to.

It seems like his plan to get her to go double or nothing, was quickly fading from his mind.

Could he summon forth the guts to take everything from her? To trick her into losing it all? To strip every single penny from her being?

Never had he hustled someone, and been called a friend for it!

He smiles awkwardly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey... Umm... Friend.. What were you going to buy with this money?&#34;</font> He questions, as he scratches his cheek and suddenly finds the water behind them extremely interesting. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) sagely nods as the results unfold before her. Watching as Hanako speeds through the seven stages of grief was a nostalgic one- she, too, learned the horrors of gambling the hard way. 

<font color = white>&#34;Mm?&#34;</font> She waved off the noble&#39;s concerns. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s only the ten ryo I gave them earlier. Besides- people don&#39;t realize the weight money has until its gone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Best to teach 'em early, mm'hm.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kyo (The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) offers a light huff, before looking over the woman beside her. It's hard to tell if she's checking her out or wondering what she'd look like on an operating table. Still, she looks at the children, watching them. Judging the boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) wouldn't think much of the noble's engaged staring; the meaning behind their gaze was unclear, but she wasn't looking for it. With a hum, she, too, directs her attention back on the pair as they resolve(?) their game.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) tilted her head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Uhhh... ten ryo is a lot. A pack of cookies and maybe a carton of milk? Some candy with the leftovers? It&#39;s fine! I probably don&#39;t need it! Eat enough sweets and-- did you know? Your teeth will fall right out when you least expect it.&#34;</font> 

She flashed the red-head a grin! 
There was a stalk lack of missing teeth there. 
In fact, they were in mint condition. 

<font color = white>&#34;.. they&#39;re a pain to grow back. A super major headache. Don&#39;t worry! I&#39;m better off without it. Already over it. More importantly-- weren&#39;t we supposed to be at the mansion? Or.. was that postponed?&#34;</font> 

She leeeeaned sideways, looking past him, trying to make out any crowds in the distance. Sadly, her visual range was severely limited. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [stark lack*]
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Ten ryo can nearly afford one of the cheaper books in my usual bookstore.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) a-hems!
<font color = white>&#34;Actually, they switched locations. Follow the water and you&#39;ll find them.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kyo(The slender noble-CarelessWhisperHeadass) OOCs: (IS THAT THE GRIM REAPER?!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) grimaces faintly once he realizes that someone he had just hustled was grinning in such a pure manner, at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think your teeth would fall out from a few cookies.... Umm... I&#39;ll buy you some.&#34;</font> He offers, before turning towards the location that was being shown. 

<font color = white>&#34;We can have cookies and milk, to celebrate our new friendship. How&#39;s that sound?... Some other day, though.&#34;</font>

A smile forms, before he turns to walk towards the academy headmaster&#39;s location.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s find &#39;em!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: We should!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) snapped her book shut, which she&#39;d definitely been scribbling within all this time, yes.

<font color = white>&#34;Certainly. Hopefully we won&#39;t be considered tardy. Though, at the very least, we&#39;ll arrive at the same time in that case.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Tardy's bad. But what if we're late?

<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Huh? y-You can't? Is that not normal?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Ahh..

His feet dug on the dirt beneath him as they adjusted themselves, and his grip became firm. Alright, he got it. <font color = white>&#34;Oh, and the name&#39;s Yuuto.&#34;</font>

With a smirk on his face, he wondered if this was about to surprise her. Anyhow, taking in a deep breath and holding it in, he launched her with as much strength as he could gather.</font></font></font>

A STRAWBERRY MOCHI! 

She would offer it to Kyoko.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) would offer Kikyo a hand up to the roof, so they, too, many act like they&#39;re a shinobi. Once the pair were standing, she&#39;d skeptically peer down at the mochi that was being offered.

<font color = white>&#34;Hrm..!&#34;</font> Did she <i>really</i> want some mochi that was stuffed in some kid&#39;s pocket? She squints down, thoroughly inspecting the sweet to make sure it had no pocket lint stuck to it. If it ended up being clean, she would take it.
   <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, Kikyo.&#34;</font> Nomf.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Mm-.. Being able to protect the village and those within it is an honor, and one I take great pride in.. That said, it&#39;s not a job I can recommend for everyone. At its core, the police force is a public service- we aid those that need it, and ensure the village is running smoothly. It&#39;s.. difficult, at times, but work I find very satisfying.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) watches the police cheif struggle witht he Mochi..

She would lower her head and take a big chomp of hers and jerk her head back as she lets the mochi deliciousness melt in her mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmm... Will I have the chance to become one? Even though I do not know how to fight?&#34;</font> She would say looking at Kyoko with admiration.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Haruno, Sakiko (The violet-haired girl-VixenQueen) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would scratch the back of his head. He didn&#39;t know what to say to this.

He'd dart forward, looking to close up the distance between the two of them, however he wasn't fast enough to achieve that just yet, so he'd come up rather short from his goal.

Snail's pace indeed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With a wide grin on her face, Shishorama observes Lero as he approaches her at speeds unattainable to herself, moving like lightning!

Winding back a fist, she aims to clock Laro in the jaw!</font></font></font>

He awaits the boy&#39;s response as the intense youngster appears to launch the first strike. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s see what he does now.&#34;</font> The sharp-toothed boy&#39;s arms fold, observant in stance.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) saw Shishorama close the gap between the two, now finally getting into striking range. About time their tiny little arms could see some action. She cocked her fist, launching it straight for his jaw.

Fortunately, the boy would lift his hands up infront of his face, letting his forearms take the brunt of the attack. His technique was rather lousy, to say th least.

As her attack ended it was time for his own, launching a counter-attack of his own, cocking his hand and sending it towards her gut.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) could hardly deal with Laro&#39;s raw offensive speed. As hardy and braggadocious as she was, she had little practice in the real art of battle, and lacked the capability to back up her talk with skill alone. Indeed, she was outclassed in every regard!

Still, she just barely manages a block and swings at Laro&#39;s chin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, this is close! I don&#39;t think I can beat you yet!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would once again attempt to evade the attack, this time ducking under attack. He'd quickly answer right back with a hit of his own, trying to once again hit at her body.

The girl&#39;s eyes bug out as the pain spreads through her abdomen. Strangely enough, her smile only grows. As his fist smashes into her body, could feel her sturdy frame harden as if preparing for the blow. She was well on her way to developing a tough physique, unfortunately she just wasn&#39;t there yet.

<font color = white>&#34;That was a good one!&#34;</font> She exclaims wildly as she throws yet another sloppy punch to the other&#39;s face!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) looked back at the wandering child- a wave tossed his way.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey! Nope, not at all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Some of the students wanted to get some practice before classes start.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) could feel that she was suprisingly sturdy compared to his hits, perhaps something he neeed to work on in due time. Yet he landed a hit, none-the-less. But it didn't seem like it slower her down much as she launched another attack right back at him.

Once again he managed to block it, but surely his ability to block shots was running out.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) smiled as he was informed he wasn&#39;t late.

<font color = white>&#34;Whew... Thank goodness.&#34;</font> he says, returning a wave towards the police chef now. They&#39;d then look on to the sparring match, observing the two going at it as he relaxed with the others.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With a swift movement, Shishorama brings her forearm up to deflect Laro's incoming strike. In a split second, she turns the tables and attempts to deliver a powerful blow to his sternum, showcasing her tenacity and grit despite her lack of refined martial prowess. Her unyielding spirit and unwavering determination serve as her greatest weapon, allowing her to hold her own against even the most skilled opponents.

His folded arm stance remains. The teen shifts to stand the amber-haired boy.

And it was quite a strong one, as she managed to hit him right into his sternum with a rather powerful punch. It knocked the air out of him, causing him to hunch over a bit, sustaining rather heavy injury.

As he held his stomach, it was quite evident, one of those would probably put him out of the commission.

He could probably land a few more hits on her but would it be enough? Probably not.

Her face shifts from inanely happy to genuine concern. <font color = white>&#34;Oh! I&#39;m sorry!&#34;</font> She exclaims as she pats Laro&#39;s back, trying to get some air back into his lungs.

Seizing the moment, she throws a punch right back, aiming for the dancer&#39;s midsection...Is what she would have done but her cousin saved her oddly.

<font color = white>&#34;Rather rude of you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between the two Senjus and white haired dancer. Was this an altercation brewing in real time. Perhaps something needed to be done to calm the tensions.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys, umm, how about we all just take a moment to cool off? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) nervously watched the few bicker amongst themselves.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A pleasure to meet you Kamiya!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Swallowing her pride, she steps forward with her hand extended in a gesture of apology.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</font> she says sincerely, looking into the dancer&#39;s eyes. <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to offend you. If I&#39;ve said or done something to upset you, I apologize.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am not sure what I said as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gsaze as he never exactly got his question answered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Pfew. Glad that&#39;s sorted out. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) yawned, what a morning it had been already, just idly passing the time. She would just glance over to the girl next to her briefly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. We haven&#39;t spoken before but since we&#39;re standing here. I&#39;m Okiku.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) glad the fighting stopped. She would've just kept taking punches for either student until she passed out. Crisis averted.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) squinted between them, obviously suspicious of the apology and pleasant greetings. Darting eyes warily regarded the hand gesture. This was the second weirdo to say something and then pretend they didn&#39;t know it&#39;d be a problem. Shoulders roll, dislocating and then -popping- back into place as she maintained her expression, despite the pain that should have caused.

<font color = white>&#34;... fine.&#34;</font> She mumbled, carefully taking her hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (was glad*

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Teach me how to roll my shoulder like that!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks over at the shoulder dislocating like that.

<font color = white>&#34;That looked painful. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: You should get that checked out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) released the other girl&#39;s hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to teach. Just do it.&#34;</font> She replied, ignoring the cautions against arthritis. <font color = white>&#34;Of course it was painful.&#34;</font> She replied, wondering how it could not be-- or why anyone would do it if it wasn&#39;t. Dislocation could be useful for escaping binds, though...

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can ger arthiritis.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: At least you'll be easy to find, Shishorama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) held a hand out and bent her index finger nearly all the way back, until it was curling backwards. This was less of a dislocation and more of a hypermobility, though-- but which kid would even care? There's a slight shift in expression, suggesting this was somehow more painful than the shoulder roll.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) widened her eyes at Kamiya&#39;s finger. What the heck is even that?! <font color = white>&#34;Oh my goodness! Your finger is <b>BROKEN</b>!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Nope, the bones are just fine.
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: ...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya watches with a mixture of fascination and curiosity as the white-haired dancer flexes her index finger backward in an extreme display of hypermobility. For a moment, Sakuya thinks she can detect a wince in the dancer&#39;s eyes, a subtle hint that this unusual flexibility comes at a cost.

Intrigued, a thought crosses Sakuya&#39;s mind: this girl might be just as eccentric as she is. Feeling a newfound sense of kinship, she can&#39;t help but feel that a friendship between them could be equally intriguing and enriching.

Taking a step closer, Sakuya smiles and extends her hand in a friendly gesture. <font color = white>&#34;You know, we might have more in common than we thought. Would you like to be friends? I&#39;m Sakuya, by the way. Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would dead pan and turn towards Shishorama.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s a Kaguya- Like the Hokage.&#34;</font> Hoping this would shed some light on their abilities in some compacity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s jaw dropped as he saw Kamiya&#39;s finger.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s...scary to see. Also anyone else started to feel pain in their fingers after seeing that? No, just me? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*she's)

<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: So it was an over reaction?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Who cares that she's a Kaguya?! She just broke- twisted her finger!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Do we have a medic-nin nearby?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) let her finger snap back. <font color = white>&#34;Sure, Sakuy--&#34;</font> Kamiya stopped mid sentence, certain she had heard another unlucky soul who wanted to receive a punch. The feeling vanished after a moment. Her finger is held with her other hand, and its discolored, now-- significantly redder than the others, a little swollen. It was hardly a free action as evidenced by this cost.

<font color = white>&#34;It hurts, but it isn&#39;t broken.&#34;</font> She said, to the intense youngster. <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t break my bones.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
