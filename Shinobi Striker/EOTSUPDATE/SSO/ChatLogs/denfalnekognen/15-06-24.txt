<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) wasn't going to let anybody overtake her so easily - her motivation must've boosted her luck somehow, for she once more took over the lead.

The toad tried hitting her once more and, instead of either dodging or getting hit full on, it was a graze that made her go a bit slower than usual.</font></font></font>

He would have to retake his lead later...</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) saw it. A hole in the storm, and a hole between the heckling shrooms. She dove, sliding under an assault, but coming just shy of her intended goal.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) was too distracted with the billowing sand that he didn't see the result of his own cast die.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) felt almost completely confident now that she saw her closest rival stumble back. She grinned confidently.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m winning! I&#39;m going to w-&#34;</font>

Then a toad hit her right on the face, causing her to roll back to right where she was. She still had a lead, but for how long?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) -- Another slide. Another unpleasant landing. But she got further! Third place?!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) regains his composure and begins staggering forward. Finally getting the sand out of his lungs before shouting in response to his sister.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The leery boy-T0r1x) kept running forward, but was surprised to see a toad had caught up with him. A strong push slowed him down, but he continued to make a little progress.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) yells: nuuu!

She paused as her eyes stared at the growing fubuki who was in first palce.

<font color = white>&#34;her body lowers at a 90 degree angle to allow the air current to pass her..from above.&#34;</font> 

<font color = white>&#34;the air..rose up at a angle to block the side lash of sand grains before rushing forwards.&#34;</font> She paused. <font color = white>&#34;hwoever..it was then...she was hit at her side..being  knocked back...you see...she is currently in the zone..but hasent fully entered it yet..&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blown back once more, starting to sniffle, she was starting to grow angry.. those near her would feel heat coming off from her small body, as her chakra flared up.. it was the first time her chakra was displayed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw behind her the boy who was now threatening to be first. She couldn&#39;t allow it. Never! She began running more and more, she was still the closest towards the finish line.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) managed to crawl forward slightly as he climbs back to his feet. Muttering to himself as he watches everyone else race ahead.

<font color = white>&#34;You did?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) thinks: No way... The money keeps getting further away...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) scrambled back on her feet, seeing the leery boy nearly overtake her! Over her dead body, she would let him! Now they were neck, and neck.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#990000>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stumbles forward, pushing against the ever threatening mushroom people. Trying his best to not get pushed backward yet again!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) snatched up a simple stone from the edge of the arena. It was nothing more than a pebble, really, about the same width as his finger. Hardly any real injuries would come of enduring a strike from such. But...

...it made for a great interference mechanism.

Keen eyes narrow upon the girl in front, the one with the light-purple hair. A whip of arm launched a pebble right for their forehead. 

<font color = white>&#34;How&#39;s this, Sensei?&#34;</font>
Clearly his actions were Authority-approved.

It didn&#39;t sound like a request, but it wasn&#39;t spoken particularly forcefully either.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) held a hand up, waving the Buritos off. <font color = white>&#34;No thanks. I&#39;m not much of a fan of salty snacks. I like sweet snacks.&#34;</font> she explained.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) nods in understanding, grabbing another fistful of chips to snack on. </font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;How.. to aim?&#34;</font>

Aiming. Aiming. Err. Exactly how would someone place words to an explanation like that? Internal questionings surfaced in the wrinkle of brow while he pondered. Uh... 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nothing special. It&#39;s not something someone can really teach as much as it is something your body learns. You just have to throw a lot. I&#39;ve been throwing things ever since I learned how to close my fingers around objects, so..&#34;</font>

He paused to pluck up a flat stone. A whip of arm sent it spiraling like shuriken for the moat water. It skips a grand total of seven times before hitting the distant northeastern moat-wall with a solid clack!

<font color = white>&#34;.. practice makes perfect?&#34;</font>
He shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: In short? I throw by feel. That sounds about right. Instinct.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) rummages in his bag pulling out a package of Pocky. He takes two sticks out and places them in his mouth half of the sticks stick out of his mouth.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) scoffed a laugh.
<font color = white>&#34;A decent way of looking at it. So. Did you get held back a year or two? Or.. did you get a late start?&#34;</font>

A moment&#39;s spent gazing across the moat, at all their peers, before refocusing on the tall one. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the latter. I gave up on learning my family&#39;s... <i>primary business</i> to do this. Never too late to start learning how to do violence for profit. Right?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh, not too sure what I like doin' for fun.

<font color = white>&#34;Likewise fer me. Couldn&#39; walk fer a year. That didn&#39; help. But ah got better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) takes a deep breath and and exhales.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) blinked a few times before looking the boy up and down.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Eat as many rocks as you want...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) takes a step back and stands next to Meixun and nudges his awake.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) eyes her up and down returning the energy.

While Shuye is temporarily keeping her attention off of him, he gives a few 'knowing' winks over toward the other kid's way. He has NO idea who he even is, but he's convinced himself... He will show the fellow kid the way before too long.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) tilted his head. Err. Couldn&#39;t walk for a year-- 
Yeah, that sounds like the kind of personal matters anyone with basic common decency shouldn&#39;t ask about. So he didn&#39;t!

<font color = white>&#34;I see. Well. Best of luck to you, in your future laden with dodging rocks for the rest of the year. I won&#39;t go easy on you, if the legal opportunity finds me again,&#34;</font> he told them, wearing an unseen grin. </font></font></font>
