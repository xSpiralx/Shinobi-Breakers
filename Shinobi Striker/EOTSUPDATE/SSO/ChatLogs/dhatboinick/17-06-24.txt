His arms are folded, and he watches his classmates with a focused intensity. Unlike his usual assertive demeanor, he chooses silence over action, content to observe the unfolding events with a reserved demeanor.

In this moment of calm amidst chaos, Sogeki's presence is palpable yet understated. His eyes scan the surroundings, taking in every detail with a thoughtful and analytical gaze. It's clear he's not here to dominate or assert himself overtly but rather to understand and strategize. Amidst the charged atmosphere of determination and pride, Sogeki's measured approach stands out, hinting at a deeper calculation and readiness to act when the time is right.</font></font></font>

He blinks, with a little curious tilt from his own head as he watches Sogeki. The puzzled look on his soft features was giving away his uncertainty about the other's seeming attitude. He would look away should the other try to meet his gaze. He wasn't interested in picking a fight with someone who looked like they put rocks in their own shoes for fun.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki stands amidst the bustling activity of his peers, a subtle awareness prickling at the edge of his senses. He feels the weight of someone's gaze upon him, a piercing stare trying to draw his attention. Keeping his arms folded across his chest, he remains outwardly composed, his expression unreadable.

His gaze drifts off into the distance, not directly meeting the source of the glare but aware of its presence. The atmosphere around him buzzes with energy, conversations blending into a low hum that he tunes out effortlessly. Sogeki's mind wanders briefly, contemplating the day's events and the tasks ahead.

Then, a movement catches his eye—a flicker of motion on the edge of the training ground. It's an interaction he hasn't seen before, unfolding with intrigue and curiosity. Intrigued, Sogeki's focus shifts, his analytical mind now fully engaged as he observes with a keen interest, temporarily forgetting the lingering sensation of someone's scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki's gaze sharpened as he recognized the familiar aura—sharp, unyielding, like a blade slicing through the air. It was the stern bastard from a few days ago, the one who dared to challenge him openly. Without shifting his stance, Sogeki turned his attention towards the source of the voice, his eyes fixing on the shark-like boy.

Their eyes locked in a silent duel, each assessing the other with unspoken intensity. Sogeki's stare was icy, piercing, as if daring the other to meet his gaze head-on. He conveyed a silent challenge through his unwavering glare, a message of defiance and readiness to engage if provoked.

Despite the tension, Sogeki remained composed, arms folded across his chest, exuding an air of quiet confidence. He waited, patient yet vigilant, observing how the sharkboy would react under his unwavering scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And for your knowledge,i read medical books,but at other times a different sorts of ones aswell
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the veteran,the commander, as they spoke, and he wondered what fate they had just doomed his peer to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stared blankly at Sogeki. He pushed his glasses up, the sunlight glinting off the lenses dramatically. He pointed, positioning his body sideways. <font color = white>&#34;You act like a robot. I&#39;d fight you now but alas...&#34;</font> He tilted is head down sadly, <font color = white>&#34;I am without shoes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was being chased?! This was no good. His rolling wasn&#39;t taking him far.
<font color = white>&#34;New plan.&#34;</font>

He was going to do the most unstoppable means of escape. Springing out of his ball form and then going completely still. Like a...like uhh...-like a STATUE!!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) The squint didn&#39;t leave Sogeki&#39;s face. The embedding threat that stands before him.. it rocks Sogeki&#39;s core. Naturally, he&#39;s shaking in his boots.. But he refuses to dishonor the Satetsu name by back down.

Sogeki stands strong-- and steps forward even stronger.

The aggressive lad accepts his fate.
  <font color = white>&#34;Ready to accept my consequences. I simply allow for at least a two on one opportunity. I wish for my father to recognize my body after this.. Commander.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Satetsu, Sogeki(The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) OOCs: (by backing*)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) inched a bit forward.. still confused by what was developing infront of her, before asking. <font color = white>&#34;Help with what...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) approaches Sogeki and settles a large hand on their shoulder, his figure towering them easily. <font color = white>&#34;My soldiers do <i>not</i> yield. But I admire such personality.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The hunt will be retracted. Tell me your name.

The weight of the veteran&#39;s hand on his shoulder is both comforting and imposing, a reminder of the authority he carries. Sogeki meets the veteran&#39;s gaze with a defiant glare, the flames of determination burning fiercely in his eyes despite the fear that churns within him.

He stands his ground, unwilling to show weakness despite the overwhelming presence of the veteran. Sogeki knows the importance of respect in the shinobi world, especially when facing someone of higher rank. Yet, beneath the surface, his resolve remains unbroken, a testament to his unwavering spirit amidst the intimidating atmosphere.

<font color = white>&#34;..of the Satetsu. But soon everyone will call me the Kraken Slayer.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If my soldier says they will obtain a title then that it is how it will be.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Do you understand?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stared in complete astonishment. Beginning to wonder if this boy named <i>Blast</i> was sent here by some cosmic entity.. Though - sleep or not.. Still or not! 

                         <b><i>HE HAD A JOB TO DO.</b></i>

Manipulating his body in such a dramatic fashion as if he was a <i>snake</i>. His presence looming over behind him. It was time. <b><i>Fifty damned Ryo was at stake!</b></i>
      <i><font color = white>&#34;Pin him down as I~...!&#34;</font></i>

The half-shark would grasp the top of his briefs, wasting no time before hopping over his body soon after. Delivering a <i>vicious</i> <b><i>WEDGIE</b></i>! Certainly giving Asa some flashbacks of his very own from the day prior. Landing over the boy he would stand proud. A grin sprayed over his face.

<b><i>The job.. was done.</b></i></font></font></font>

Sogeki thinks for a moment, then shrugs. He eases into the comfort of the topic.
  <font color = white>&#34;I do.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;But not without cause. Even if it&#39;s frowned upon by the public.. if it needs to be done. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Fine,&#34;</font> he starts, squeezing the boy&#39;s shoulder, <font color = white>&#34;Kraken Slayer must be earned.&#34;</font>

A punch occurs, far too fast to be seen by anyone around. It plants into Sogeki&#39;s stomach with cratering force.

His hand falls from the boy&#39;s shoulder, leaving them to relish in the impacts recoil.

<font color = white>&#34;Now. Why do I see someone giving wedgies?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) didn&#39;t care anymore. His face, having been pasted full of horror, stayed facing the ground. His tone speaking as if he was already dead.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s body jerks forward as the veteran&#39;s fist slams into his stomach with brutal force. The impact sends a shockwave of pain through him, causing him to grit his teeth and stagger backward. His hands instinctively clutch at his abdomen, trying to alleviate the intense ache that spreads from the point of impact.

Despite the pain, Sogeki locks eyes with the crimson-haired veteran, his gaze unwavering. His pride refuses to let him show weakness or back down, even in the face of such a harsh lesson. He takes a deep breath, swallowing his pride along with the pain, and straightens up slowly, though the discomfort is evident on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand,&#34;</font> Sogeki manages to say through clenched teeth, his voice strained but defiant. He exhales sharply, willing himself to remain composed despite the throbbing pain in his gut. His eyes remain fixed on the veteran, a silent acknowledgment of the respect he holds for the commander&#39;s authority.</font></font></font>

When he walked back over, she observed his demeanor and that call he made-- She, too, widened her eyes with shock. Not one ounce of her wanted to imagine what that felt like. 

Before she could offer a hand or deliver his justice..

He was gone.

    His arm sliding out of his sleeve as his upper body laid bare. Turning southbound to face Sogeki. The student granted the privilege of hunting and punching him. This was perfectly fine to him.

The neck of his cracked as he readied himself. His right hand raising itself, motioning in a &#39;<i>come on, then</i>&#39; gesture. Thus he spoke finally.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Hunt me? Fine then, let&#39;s do it. Punch me? Do it..</b>&#34;</font>, his finger pointed in Najiro&#39;s direction, his face grinning widely as he continued.

        Moving along to the side, letting the next recipient take their turn in receiving the punch from the fellow student, Sogeki.
