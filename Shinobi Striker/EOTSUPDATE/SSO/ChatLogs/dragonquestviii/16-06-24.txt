He did, however, manage to grab the pipe before it fully submerged. With that, he yelled up to his fellow Hoshigaki.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay! Okay. Great. Good. Yo Cous, wanna come give me a hand with this? We gotta keep the concrete dry with this pipe while we fill these cracks.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and pouts at the words of the dark-skinned dancer. He would slowly walk towards the village, dragging his feet while lifting his kimono as to not sully it.  A visible scowl/pout on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;This is not fun at all...&#34;</font>, he mumbled as he headed deeper into the village, the sound of yelling and footsteps disappearing behind him. After a 10 minute walk, he would arrive on the steps of a large building with a large bright neon sign reading <font color = white>&#34;Ame Convenience&#34;</font>.

A sigh escapes his lips, as he enters and begins collecting packages of water. He would make multiple trips from the isles to the counter as he stacked 3 cases of water onto the counter.

A trickle of sweat would slide down his small brow, as he wiped it away with his sleeve. He would then head towards the back of the store and begin grabbing bags of ice. They were surprisingly less hefty than he had expected. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, do you happen to have something I can carry all this in? They wanted me to make multiple trips but I dont think that is going to work. It will take forever.&#34;</font>, he politely asked the shopkeep. He would explain his work at the bridge and how he had been assisting with rebuilding the destroyed bridge.

After a long discussion, they would be directed to the shops horse and buggy which he would loan the child only due to it being a mission to assist the village. After paying for the supplies, the small child would load all of his material into the horse and buggy, getting into the carriage and grabbing the reigns. 

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you, sir!&#34;</font>, he said, before quickly having the reigns snatched by the shopkeep who also entered the buggy. Apparently letting a 10 year old disappear with his only method of transporting his stock was too much to ask.

With a pout the two would slowly head back towards the bridge, the large stockpile of water and ice bouning in the carriage. As they approached all of the busy works scurrying around the bridge, they would wave. </font></font></font>

His hands lugging the two large jugs of iced tea on over to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Here you are sir.&#34;</font> His arms was shaking eeever so faintly.

     <font color = white>&#34;Is this some new way of asking for help..?&#34;</font>

Or at least it was until the mention of a <b>THREE. MINUTE. BREAK</b>. Was this the life of the men behind the repairs of the village? A simple three-minute break?

This, was the best way to go about fixing such a crack - Otherwise, the concrete would become damaged by the water, and due to the sharp point of the pipe, it would be easy enough to lodge it in the ground, creating a solid pillar of concrete within the crack itself to maintain structure. The surface level could be fixed traditionally, but underwater, the concrete would become waterlogged. Thankfully, two shark-men are better than one.

<font color = white>&#34;Eh, break? Three minutes...? We&#39;re not exactly doing anything strainworthy here just yet, we can just save our three minutes and take a six-minute break later. Keheheheh!&#34;</font>, he barked out, as he eventually filled the pipe with concrete. 
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, now just put it flush into the crack, lean it all the way vertical so the point is digging into the ground at the bottom, and we can fill the top part. This thing&#39;s just a solid concrete-steel pole at this point, it&#39;ll keep this strut held good.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

With that the construction worker simultaneously released his grip on the boy&#39;s shirt and took a firm grasp of his pants. Giving him the most gnarly wedgie imaginable.

Yet again, the mirror&#39;s the man&#39;s words. Her hands move once more, a standard attempt at imitating what he had displayed for her. She presses softer into the ground this time with the tool. There doesn&#39;t come a hard bit of damage like before... but the area certainly isn&#39;t the smoothest to anyone with a good eye.

For an amateur, it was all one could really expect.

     <font color = white>&#34;I guess.. As long as this thing pays.&#34;</font>

Wriggling and desperately attempting to free himself from the contractor&#39;s hold on his undies, he said <font color = white>&#34;Fine! Fine! Just let go!&#34;</font> and with a whimper, finished with, <font color = white>&#34;This is child abuse...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Now shadowing the actions of his relative. 
                 <font color = white>&#34;Like this, right? Or am I being to loose along the steel pipe..?&#34;</font>, he spoke, his words coming off as a new employee seeking affirmation.

The actions of what went on above his head caught little of his attention. Though the audible noise of a kids underwear <i>ripping</i> caught his attention for a short while. A cringed expression spreading across his face but you know..

The contractor looked back to the new arrival. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s much better. Just be sure to keep it even. The stuff pretty much levels itself so slow is fast.&#34;</font>

The man then went over to examine the shark&#39;s work. <font color = white>&#34;Lookin&#39; good shark boys. I&#39;ll have you two come up and here and get ready to pour the new surface for the bridge as soon as wedgie boy here finishes the forms.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
