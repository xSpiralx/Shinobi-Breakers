<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) sits down while he waits for more youngsters to wake up. Shaking his head, the old man would mutter to himself <font color = white>&#34;Kids these days.. during my time we always woke up before the sun was even up..&#34;</font>

Grumbling like the old man he was, Wu would simply look at the horizon as he pondered on where to visit first. Though it wasn&#39;t much of a question, since he had forgot his umbrella, making his trip to Amegakure impossible. Perhaps Iwagakure might be the way to go.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (you not gonna ask for a TP to another vill?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) picks his nose without a care in the world, knowing that no one can tell him anything due to the inherent values of Confucianism that are deeply rooter in our modern day society and that demand respect toward the elderly.

<font color = white>&#34;During my days Akihabara was a more lively place to live in.. what have the youth done to my village..&#34;</font> he sighs as he complains about the youth like any respectable old man would do.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) turns toward the direction of the old man, scoffing in his direction.

<font color = white>&#34;Give it time, old fart. Akihabara will flourish soon.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) turns toward the only other individual with the decency of still running a business within the great economic center that was Akihabara.
Unfortunately. the old man could neither see or hear well, barely registering the merchant&#39;s appearance as something blurry.. while completely misunderstanding his words..

<font color = white>&#34;Give me fart, Akihabara flour soup..? Tsk tsk..&#34;</font> he repeats, before shaking his head in disappointment <font color = white>&#34;Fart this, fart that.. kids these days..Your sales pitch is weak lad. You need to work on that!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) waves off the elder, a disinterested look visible on his face. He returns checking his inventory, a moment passes before he speaks.

<font color = white>&#34;Akihabara may have fallen on hard times, but we&#39;ll return to that golden age of prosperity.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) grumbled to himself, missing half of the words the fellow merchant spoke. Though what little he had heard made him nod approvingly.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s right lad! You are a smart cookie, you&#39;ll go far.&#34;</font> he squints in an attempt to see the merchant&#39;s face, only to be met by the harsh reality that was his failing sight <font color = white>&#34;I am sure you already know, but if you don&#39;t, then let this old man give you some information.&#34;</font> he coughs, clearing his throat <font color = white>&#34;Rain and Rocks are the future of commerce! Keep an eye out on those two villages.. in a year or two they will become a good source of business.&#34;</font>

While his words were fancy, the content was... common knowledge. <font color = white>&#34;Now.. this old man will leave to your job.&#34;</font> he moves away, walking as slowly as one would expect form the elderly</font></font></font>

While the old man couldn&#39;t hear the purple-haired girl&#39;s voice, the mention of ryo allowed such trifling physical details to be easily overlooked.

<font color = white>&#34;Ryo..? Ohohoh!&#34;</font> he chuckles, his hands rubbing together out of habit <font color = white>&#34;I haven&#39;t brought much with me.. but I do have some cheap things that can be sold..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) turned around and yelled out to make sure the old man could hear her:

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll buy a Katana for 300 ryo, final offer!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I might take a look at those wares later, Old Timer. Class calls. Later.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Five minutes to class- Oh many I totally zoned out!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) follows the fleeing children away <font color = white>&#34;seems our class is about to start, I dont think you have much luck selling anytime soon.&#34;</font> She calls over her shoulder. 

she placed the wrinkled face in her mind for now. <font color = white>&#34;I will find you one day old man, I have things I will be needing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) also jumped closer so she could, hopefullyy, be heard better.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;So you weren&#39;t a rude lad, but a feisty lass.&#34;</font> he shakes his head, realizing that the age of cute and proper ladies had long ended, now instead replaced by this punk mentality <font color = white>&#34;This old man only has cheap stuff now. No weapons. Not like I would sell such dangerous things to a greenhorn ayway..&#34;</font> he chuckles, moving closer to the iron vessel</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) sighed - she finally got gendered properly but she didn&#39;t get any good deal.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay, fuck. I gotta leave. Fuck shit fuck!&#34;</font> she muttered to herself while running off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Young man.. you aren't old. To me, you are just a bit better than these kids.
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Oh it's time to go.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Ohohoh.. so energetic. This old man might as well take a look. I wonder how the stones teach their little pebbles
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) leaves the area, and proceeds to roam toward the academy.. that is, if he can find it</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah it was Kaido but- He's weird, don't worry about it man.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) slowly enters what he thinks is the academy, before taking a quiet spot to himself as he proceeded to watch the ongoing lesson while rubbin his bald head out of habit.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (brother eugh! Why this old man rubbing himself in the corner)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (Only fitting.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (Ready to post at exactly X-10)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) wonders for a time where his brother could be, though he eventually yields his mind to focus on himself.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) witnessed a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.

(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Oh good heavens, that's a lot of words...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) slings his arm around Hideo's shoulder, his eyes searching for the troublemarker</font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers faintly.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (so when can we start, rn?)

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Maaaaan I'm not great at hand-to-hand... Guess it's time to push past my limits!!! Raaah!!!!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) approaches the crate first, slinging a Vectro Belt over his shoulder and scurrying off. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: A ban on throwing things... hah.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'll make it work.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Heh, sounds quite difficult..
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: That's the spirit, test previously established limits!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the rules of engagement from the light-haired senior who hosted this streamer game. It was unusual, something he wasn&#39;t used to, but truthfully it did sound a little fun. It was a raw test of agility and not much else.

  <font color = white>&#34;Seems like it&#39;ll be based mostly on chance if you make it to the end. I&#39;m game for a little flag tag.&#34;</font> He leans off the wall.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So what are streamers?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) hummed softly, not too sure how to come out of this successfully. She doubted she'd win but figured it'd be a good way to pass the time so she moved toward the crate and grabbed herself a velcro belt with one streamer each, strapping both to her hips.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) picks his nose without a care in the world, before tossing the booger to the side. Luckily, confucianism made it impossible for younger people to criticize the elderly.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohohoh.. Iwagakure sure loves its violence.&#34;</font> he comments as he takes a seat, fully intending to watch the brawl unfold</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: What are streamers? The red and blue fabric attached to your velcro belts.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) begins to roll his shoulders and grins at Katora. Knowing that the masked boy couldn&#39;t use his eagle eye to snipe flags off of belts. With his arms rudimentarily stretched he steps forward! Grabbing a belt and affixing the little streamers to the velcro spots on the belt.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright! I&#39;m gonna win- Wait how do we win this game? Do we collect a bunch of flags?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: So ya lose both, you lose?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) barked out a laugh <font color = white>&#34;A fun game I suppose if not simple, if only I had some sake to sip as I watched.&#34;</font> She said notig the blonde had not replied to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;A more fitting name would be Royale Rumble.&#34;</font> She said as she stalked closer to the crate to reach in and secure her belt across her waist.
<font color = white>&#34;Let us dance then!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Percisely!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Who do I room with?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Or are we decidin' our opponents?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked to the set of velcro belts and put one of them on, adjusting it so it&#39;d feel comfortable for her. It would probablyy be a bit chaotic right from the get go so she did the smart thing of gettting a bit further away the moment she could to not get instantly defeated by everyone at once.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font> she breathed in, slowly inhaling and exhaling. <font color = white>&#34;Who wants to go?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: <Already forming small teams, a coveted aspect of shinobi velcro belt. They're quick learners..Buttt-there can only be one winner..>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (my ass said rolapley...)
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: W-Wait no seriously how do we win?! We just lose if we get both flags taken but like- Do we win if we get more belts than someone else?
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) yells: Last person standing wins!
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Duh..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh, cool
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: It's a -free for all-
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh so we don't hold onto the flags or nothin'. Goooooot it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) scratched the thinking side of his skull and then walked forward towards the dark trove to claim a Ninja Velcro Belt. Complete with two streaming wisps on each side of his waist.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Let go of me.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: It sounds like... the kind of game where getting jumped is very likely.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Perfect!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Forming a squad seems like the ideal counter, but... going it alone sounds more fun.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (Sorry, only grabbed you to drop a RP wall.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (I saw the erp, you a fiend
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well- I've got my belt. Time to run off...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) yells: Hideo!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He-- motherfucker.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Would began to strap her two streamers on her belt, the girl had questioned if she was gonna be able to possibly. Her attention would focus on several thingsf, she wasn&#39;t quite sure what she would do for team mates.. she seemed like she would be alone.. without warning she would run off as well.. 

<font color = white>&#34;Seeing as this free for all.. I am go hide..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: They do not, hurting a enemy in battle doesn't magically restore your wounds silly.
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Protect your streamers at all costs.
<br><font color=green>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) says: Now grab your belts and get out there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) entered the academy, his jaw tightening slightly. He felt uneasy about being late to the festivities.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) entered the building a little late, be as it may, it doesn't seem like there'd be much need to be present right then and there. The trickster's repetitve instruction echoed throughout the halls, surrounded by the voice of his comradery--essentially, it seemed to be a battle royale of sorts.

A crabby voice caught his attention, recognizing that as his sister-- waved and pointed toward the collection of connecitve belts assigned. Seeing as everyone was taking one, he assumed it was only right for him to grab onto one as well. He bowed to the trickster, took himself a belt, made his way further into the building--shooting a leer at the new Kunoichi in between Cho'Kuome and Mugen. No time to recognize her signature at the moment...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) began to walk forward with belt in hand. If his brother was here, having them to partner up with would be the most ideal strategy. Though with his absence, he would have to find another way to prosper.
  <font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to go toe-to-toe, or be my friend in this game just come stand by me.&#34;</font> Is all he says.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) went ahead and secured himself a set of streamers and the harness they hung from. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll select a room and loiter there, I suppose,&#34;</font> he says to himself, though it&#39;s intentionally audible as he made his way down the hall. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (A+ customer service)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) felt a bit embarrassed after no one went after her - however she had an idea of what to do. <font color = white>&#34;Whatever, I&#39;m gone then.&#34;</font> she said before running off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [brb]

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [good luck everyone!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) walked over to the crate to grab a black belt and streamers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) whispers: (Event is taking part in the school)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chonamu(The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) OOCs: (alright cool )
<br><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) whispers: (Yeah i just read the whole rp)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (Oh, feel free to take your time.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) affixed the belt and streamers to his waist, immediately putting distance between himself and the other contestants. This was a free for all after all. He could be attacked at any second.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) certainly looks a bit lost or something, as to be expected of a class clown probably. Still, he'll go for his own belt and a pair of streamers, then head inward...
Maybe he'll get off easy or something!

All the while, there is a small smile on his face.

At no point does he at least -seem- to target anybody in particular.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) asks: Was that... Tsuneko?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Heh...

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Nyaka(The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) OOCs: (Nonchalant one, the event started up north. Feel free to go partcipate.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) Walks over to the create and pick out an Akimichi sized velcor belt. The young man struggles to get it on for a moment before getting it secure.. As he listned to the explanation of the ruels he already came up with a plan..  He'd post up on a wall and open a fresh bag of chips.. 

He was presenting himself as an easy target.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) waved her hand dismmisvely <font color = white>&#34;I spend my days drinking and reading. Truely a dullard by most accounts, let us proceed. Show me your worth Katora.&#34;</font> 

With that she would dash closer to him. No finesse or strategy, a bold bull charge forwards

TM 3.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) takes out a piece of paper from his pocket together with a small box.
