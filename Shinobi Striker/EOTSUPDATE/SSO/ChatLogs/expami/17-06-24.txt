<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) asks: heh. You never know with these children old man. Did you need something?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yawns lazily as he joins the crowd of Iwagakure&#39;s kids. As he takes a comfortable seat, the old geezer would begin writing some notes as he planned his next trip to the next village.
<font color = white>&#34;Good morning kids.&#34;</font> he greets the group as he barely manges to recognize their blurry figures despite his aging eyesight <font color = white>&#34;Seems like most of you are still half asleep though..&#34;</font> he sighs as he notices the silence and occasional snoring <font color = white>&#34;I swear.. kids these days live too comfortably.. when I was your age I would be already awake organizing wares.. tsk-tsk!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) turned her gaze to the darker skinned old man to the other old man....A village of past and new.

<font color = white>&#34;Is that so?&#34;</font> She said slowly. She resisted the urge to say more about it.

<font color = white>&#34;In any case merchant. What deals do you have on blades? I have very little Ryo as a down payment&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (from xD sorry was in valorant.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (dw, I am just chillin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) pockets away his notebook as he turns toward the young teen. Though he struggled in both sight and hearing, the old man would still make an effort to understand.. though failing miserably.

<font color = white>&#34;What deals.. on ladles?&#34;</font> he repeats, wondering how poor the kid must had been to not even have the ryo to buy kitchen wares <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t think this village lacked basic necessities like this.. I can probably get you a ladle for twenty ryo give or take.&#34;</font> he informs, quickly recalling the market price of those utensils.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) comes over and joins for a while, taking a seat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Still smells like piss
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) would cross her arms behind her back and and took afew paces closer as she gave her first offfer. 

<font color = white>&#34;I was thinking 50 ryo as a down payment. with 50% Interest on the final payment. Practically robbing me blind Oji-san.&#34;</font> she said stopping and see if the mask of being senile fell at that. 

Afterall....what merchant let age get in the way of profits?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yells: 5 ryo for a... ladle!? I just told you it's 20! I am too old for you to scam brat!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) clearly couldn't hear everything this time too</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Some things neva change
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (bro, we are both too old to not know each other since Akihabara is so small
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (we need to share names :sob:
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) scoffed, he was driving a hard bargin. She was hoping to buy the expensive sake tonight. 

<font color = white>&#34;Very well....100 Ryo down. For a Sword, nothing named mind you. But sufficent to cut down rats or the poor.&#34;</font> even as her words had ended, she had drew closer to the man. Her firey gaze locked to him and not wandering mindlessly up at the clouds or at a book. 

<font color = white>&#34;This deal to get me armed will go down in writing of course. Papiyas Niwa always recalls those who help her.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) raises an eyebrow out of confusion..
<font color = white>&#34;Why are you giving me 100 ryo for a ladle!? I told you it&#39;s 20!&#34;</font> he repeats <font color = white>&#34;Is this some kind of new age Iwagakure&#39;s scam!?&#34;</font> he takes one step back, still unable to correctly hear the young woman in front of him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) squints, <font color = white>&#34; Hey baldie! What er you doing here?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was now before the old man. She was now clearly furious at this game. <font color = white>&#34;I said nothing about a ladle&#34;</font> she spat out before taking a deep breath. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am offering you all the ryo I have on me as a down payment for a Katana. This is the third and final time I shall repeat myself. Less I am the fool.&#34;</font> She reached out her gloved hand, tensed and clearly ready to slap something should the word ladle be brought up again

<font color = white>&#34;Do we have a deal?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Deal?
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Red hair is the sign of a harlot...but you wouldn't know anything about hair! "heh"
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: .....

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) finally hears what the woman had to say, though her attitude wasn&#39;t very appreciated.
<font color = white>&#34;Katana? Why didn&#39;t you say that earlier!?&#34;</font> he clicks his tongue <font color = white>&#34;Making me waste my time..&#34;</font> he mumbles to himself, only to inform the rude girl <font color = white>&#34;Lass, you won&#39;t find any blade from Akihabara for quite a while! The supply chain has slowed down and it will affect sales for the next couple of months! So forget katanas!&#34;</font>

He shakes his head, beside, women were better with a ladle in hand rather than a sword.. though he would keep that opinion to himself, he knew that recently some weird movement called womanism was gaining popularity..</font></font></font>

She spun then. <font color = white>&#34;Old dullards here to leer at women. I will be sure to let everyone I meet know to not buy from you or your equally bald friend.&#34;</font> she spat in the direction of the other one who had nothing to say but complaints.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) yells: Buy from me? I ain't selling nothing you can afford young man!

That&#39;s clearly a lil&#39;girl, haven&#39;t you heard her haughty temper? tsk-tsk&#34;</font> he shakes his head as he leans closer, whispering to the old head, though his voice would be still loud enough to be heard by everyone.

<font color = white>&#34;Probably just started bleeding I tell ya. Hormones make them go crazy! You should have seen my daughter.. went from a lil&#39;angel to a spawn of evil!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) yells: My eye sight is just fine!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) she gave a long glare at the pair for some time. Certainly nothing good ran across her mind but she was sure to memorize them. 

<font color = white>&#34;Careful what toes you step on. This naughty girl does not respect her elders.&#34;</font> with that she gave a flip of her hair and had a seat, intent on going back to her reading. 

<font color = white>&#34;and I am a women grown. I am sure you have forgot what they look like stareing at whatever gargoyle your wives are.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

With that done, he would simply leave the area.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) didn't wave at Yurei because FUCK him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would hold up a hand to cover her mouth! 

She tried to hide the fact she was giggling at...the resentment she saw. They were off duty..so it should be..f-fine..she hoped.

====================== mushroom! =============

The yellow mushroom found themselves being attacked..and moved forwards to try and attack them before the shuriken hit their body!...however it..the shuriken hit their squishy body before they collaped on the ground to play dead!

<i>ploop!!!</i>
=====================================

<font color = white>&#34; you see...y-you see...a-ahem..you see...the reason why the mushroom couldnt counter you is because of they way the order of attacks work in this world. Perhaps made this way by the shogan himself. &#34;</font> She found herself..pausing breifly..before speaking once more.

<font color = white>&#34;Shurikenjutsu happens..first...and taijutsu happened after it mhm...however it expands to something more...as after a bit of experimentation and a few lost lifes of our iwagakurian shinobi...we have a detailed list..to make it easier for the newer generation&#34;</font>

Reaching into her pocket...she held up a piece of paper for them to read off of.

<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Mhm.. you both weren't around. Beside, that old fox Yuu was in Iwagakure as well
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (holy shit it worked)
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Yuu?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: We made it! By the way. I am Hana, my lavender haired friend.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm Fubuki, nice to meet you, you seem cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over to the horse through his peripherals only to then face it completely. His eyes take on the ether bound haze that'd become their signature and he seemed to look deep into the animals soul.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks to the creaky wagon for a moment before walking around and observing the area.
  <font color = white>&#34;Hey there, I&#39;m Yurei of the Mugen family.&#34;</font> He announced to them all as to not be a stranger.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: My name is A'suno. Shall I play my favorite tune for you?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Let's hear it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Can we make song requests?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) sighs, realizing that the youth of this day did not remember the names of the elderly..
<font color = white>&#34;Old merchant, like me, but not as good looking keh keh..&#34;</font> he shrugs, before casting his eyes to the side.. barely managing to see the figure of the kids.

<font color = white>&#34;You got clients, so I&#39;ll let you do your thing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji(Salemexc) says: Ashame the inn is closed.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno(MyThridKey) says: You cannot. My music is played from the heart. Allow me to play you.. 'Entry to Heaven'.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Ummm.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) watches the animal walk of and in that steps are made to follow it..
All the way up to the old man, in which his daydream like trance is broken.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) tilts her head in amusement. <font color = white>&#34;Are you trying to send us to heaven? Or are you sending yourself?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Where do you darlings hail from?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: We're from Iwagakure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Wagon (The old man's wagon-) looks down on the aloof aspirant with his prideful onyx orbs. Was this a staredown?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) asks: What's wrong Donut?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Are you from here?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) yells: Welcome to Akihabara, Jewel of Land!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Ogura, Junji(The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) OOCs: (of the*
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Thanks for the welcome. Are you a merchant?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Junji Ogura, craftsman. This is my forge.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) just now noticed there were fireworks.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...&#34;</font> She felt a swelling of emotion watching them color the sky.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen for slightly as the horse looked down upon him. It was a strong animal, but he wondered what laid past it's strength. He understood everything has a story.
   As his line of sight hones in directly on the onyx orbs he saught to look within them.

                 What was it that the horse's soul saught to say?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I never seen anything like it up close.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately ran up to the merchant upon hearing he was a craftsman.

<font color = white>&#34;Excuse me, do you sell katanas?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) wonders to himself whether he should have shared that or not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) approaches the forge. Her eyes beeming with excitement.

 - <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Junji.&#34;</font> Her eyes danced around whatever he was selling.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: At the moment, no. Are all of you shinobi?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Not yet.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) got on her knees and slammed the ground before getting up and sighing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Academy students...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Ouch...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I can't but a katana anywhere...my life sucks.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Could you possibly commission one?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Academy students? Out here, alone?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I certainly can.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) follows the gaze of his donkey up to the figure of the aloof kid.
<font color = white>&#34;Mhm? What&#39;s wrong lad? Want to pet Donut?&#34;</font> he asks, patting the defiant muzzle of the donkey with ease <font color = white>&#34;Give it a try, though Donut can be a bit feisty, so be careful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, we're not very smart, but I'm desperate for a weapon.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: How much would it cost to comission a katana?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: If I ever need anything I know where to go.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: This is quite a spot.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) As she stepped forward, she inhaled deeply, savoring the fresh scent of the group and the gentle caress of the breeze. While closing her eyes, Asuno immersed herself in the silence of the surroundings, feeling at one with nature. 
Suddenly, she reached for her flute and brought it to her lips. 
     <font color = white>&#34;...!&#34;</font> 
As the first notes flowed from her instrument, a melody filled the air, weaving through the trees and dancing across the rippling current. The sound harmonized with the peaceful ambiance, creating a magical tune that spoke straight to the heart. With every careful touch of her fingers on the flute, the girl breathed life into the scene, calling all who listened into a nod. The music resonated with joy. 

                              [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4z5kntXAA] 

<font color = white>&#34;..this tune, &#39;The Bridge&#39; Entry to Heaven,&#34;</font> she recites while putting the flute away.

<font color = white>&#34;Not bad huh?&#34;</font>
      <font color = white>&#34;But anyways, lets get to the real reason you&#39;re here. I&#39;m selling one-of-one plushie items and I need someone to base my first design off of. Would anyone like to be the test dummy? It&#39;ll be free.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) squinted.

<font color = white>&#34;Why couldn&#39;t we be alone? We all serve the shogun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: It can't be to much.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Don't jinx it...please...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Cool'
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: A custom Ogura blade is quite expensive.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) yells: Oh wow this place is pretty cool!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Uh...what do I get with three hundred ryo?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) turned his head toward the old man momentarily while maintaining eyes contact with the horse before he&#39;d inevitably turn his head backforward and inch closer toward the large mammal.
           
     <font color = white>&#34;Donut..&#34;</font>
      <font color = white>&#34;Is that your name?&#34;</font>, he asked calmly as he approached the animal.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Wait, you're going to make a doll out of someone?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I guess I could do it. My little sister might like that...
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Yes. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Should I come to the other side of the counter?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana watched Asuno play her flute, the melody drifting through the air. She appreciated the technical skill, but the music felt slow and needed more emotional depth. Kohana was more drawn to the vibrant, soulful energy of R&amp;B, a genre that resonated deeply with her spirit.

As Asuno finished and introduced her plushie project, Kohana smiled politely, though her mind was still on the music. <font color = white>&#34;Not bad,&#34;</font> she replied diplomatically. <font color = white>&#34;But honestly, the tune was a bit too slow for my taste. I&#39;m more of a rhythm and soul person. Still, I&#39;m curious about your plushie project. What kind of design are you thinking about?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) eyes widen with excitement as he saw many people lined up. Could this be a ninja wonder-land? As he continued to move around, he'd take note of the uniform worn by the strangers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I won't be selling anything today, but I can take orders.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Asuno on the other hand, will be.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: The design'll be made from a person here today, if there is more than one person that is interested, then we will have to play a game to find out who will be chosen.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: So this is Akihabara?..
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: What can I order with three hundred ryo? It's all I have after all. I'm looking for a blade.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (how tf does a donkey sound
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: ...This is the land of Akihabara?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (hee haw?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: So for a basic full tang katana. Can we say what amount of ryo is an acceptable fee?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Can I order 'sum 'rmor for two 'hunnit?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Wagon (The old man's wagon-) stomps the ground with his proud hooves, leaving deep marks on dirt.
Were it not for his owner's hand he might have already kicked the boy in the face.

"<i>AGGRESSIVE DONKEY SOUNDS</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) was curious what he'd could request here in the distant land.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: I guess I'll wait my turn... but I could definately use some senbons.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Don't be silly boy.. why are you trying to talk to a donkey? Donut might be smart, but he can't speak..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I'm afraid you children don't have enough for katanas or armor.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) moved towards the part of the table with the senbons on display.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hm....
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Imagine approaching a rabid animal.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) sighed kinda disappointed, but she expected it. <font color = white>&#34;Alright then, at least gimme a goal - how much will I need in the future?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: An estimate works.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: A number would be nice, yes.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: If you're interested in purchasing a Ogura original, please tell me your name and what weapon you wish to have made.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: How much for a kuai?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes a moment to really experience the music. As she was of foreign origin, her music style was different than anything that had influenced him locally.
  It was peaceful, a meditation, and thought-provoking. There was a certain free essence to it.

   Yurei thought that it was beautiful, and so he stared at the young woman a bit slack-jawed.

  <font color = white>&#34;If you want me as a doll, I could help.&#34;</font> The Mugen said, blushing at her talents!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) makes a mental note on the composed girl. No one offends his donkey without getting economic sanctions..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: One-thousand for a katana.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned toward the thoughtful, composed girl who had also offered to be used as inspiration.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I can&#39;t back down.&#34;</font> She asserted. <font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll have to play whatever game A&#39;suno decides upon.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'm Fubuki, I want a katana - one day I'll return with 700 more ryo and order it from you.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: ...!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Indeed. Or you can work in the mines for three years.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen ever so slightly as he stops just a few inches out of the donkie&#39;s hoof range.
     <font color = white>&#34;...Are-&#34;</font> - He looks at the old man. <font color = white>&#34;Would you say that this Donkey is a partner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Fubuki so you have 300?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I do yes.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: We will have to play indeed. Lets get away from the crowd. If you're interested in being a contestant for the very first edition of my plushies. Please follow me a bit north. I will then detail how the game will work.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Partner? He is my traveling partner..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh.. I wonder if Kaido would want somethin..
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I suggest you all follow Asuno.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: How much for senbon kind sir?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) hopes that the kid didn't mean any other deranged form of partner.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) pumps a fist into the air.
  <font color = white>&#34;A&#39;right.&#34;</font> He smiles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I will have prices for weapons and more by the time you all become shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: In buisness.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: For now, the forge is closed. I will accept orders, though.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Mhm.. Donut would be my employee.. right.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Hoshino Kohana handed Fubuki 200 ryo with a playful smile. <font color = white>&#34;Here, take this. It&#39;s because we match in hair color,&#34;</font> she said, her eyes twinkling with mischief. <font color = white>&#34;Who knows, we might have some kind of blood ties,&#34;</font> she added with a light-hearted laugh, enjoying the moment. <font color = white>&#34;Consider it a gift from one lavender-haired friend to another.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Begins to scratch their head,just wondring who are these people</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm.. 
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: You mean tha' loser who called me fat?
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Fubuki, I'll mark you down for a katana.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks down to the soil in thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you sell Kunais.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: Now to raise 500 more ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: You don't listen very well, do you?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Will we have permits to travel to these lands?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Also can you save and order for me? One Kunai and 10 senbons?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) followed A'suno.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Your name?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: ... Ah... My name is Afro
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I'll wait four more minutes to be sure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Did you ask them?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Afro,i will check whats going on over there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) needed a moment to realize she suddenly got a bunch of money from her new friend. <font color = white>&#34;Wait are you sure about this?!&#34;</font> then quickly she had to turn around to talk to the blacksmith, she was very overwhelmed by all of these things going on. <font color = white>&#34;O-okay then! I &#39;unno exactly when I&#39;ll pay you back but I&#39;ll come back and pay full price! Thank you mister!&#34;</font> she bowed towards Junji before looking at Hana again. <font color = white>&#34;Okay, I owe you one big time. I won&#39;t forget this. Now, are we going to check out that game?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Forgive me merchant, what might I refer you as?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) looks to the side, as his very poor hearing still managed to catch some of the discussion.
<font color = white>&#34;Keh keh.. young man. I already told them about the supply chain issues. But do you think kids that still smell of milk can understand?&#34;</font> he chuckles</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Junji Ogura.
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I have you marked down for the kunai and senbon.
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) says: Who? Donut? I don't need to ask, this bad boy follows me wherever I go
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: One of you spoke about a game correct?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) ignored the manner as to which the merchant was flamboyant, and offer a smile. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you Junji of the Ogura family. I look forward to our next encounter.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hrnnn
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Two minutes left.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) nods! <font color = white>&#34;Very sure! My father used a katana. I remember how much it meant to him. And I think I will pass on the game. I&#39;m suddenly feeling a daze.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Is it free one?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: But goodluck!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Your father is very cool. Uh, are you okay though?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: How'd you get one?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I am fine. Just need a wee nap.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...buying their horse will be very wrong.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: So yer' a merchant that doesn't have anything to sell?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) tucks the flute into her back pocket in exchange for a pair of white dice. 
       <font color = white>&#34;This is a game I learned as a child and I used it to determine who would have leftovers between me and my late brother.&#34;</font>

The tone was upbeat despite the tragic news. 

<font color = white>&#34;The game is simple and the winner will model and recieve the very first edition of my plushie collection for free. I&#39;ll start to sell them afterwards, and that is assuming you make enough of a name for yourself to earn one.&#34;</font>

The dice are thrown into the center for the group to expect. The numbers were digital-and advanced. <font color = white>&#34;The game is called &#39;200&#39;. Everyone will roll the dice using &#39;200&#39;. The number you get will act as your next roll number, and it could range from 199-to-1, it all depends on your luck.&#34;</font>

With a soft laugh, she concludes. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ll keep rolling &#39;your&#39; lowest number until you get to &#39;1&#39;. The last person to hit &#39;1&#39; will be the winner. Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Maybe we should be talkin' to that one over there.. I think they said their name was Junji or somethin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) shooes away the willful kid as he turns his attention to Ogura <font color = white>&#34;You are correct young man.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I'm a girl..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Sorry to hear that flute girl..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It's okay, that is a story for another time.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: But alright...guess i will play,i already know im gonna lose.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her attention back to A&#39;suno, and listened. As she started to describe the game, the smaller, blue-haired, angry-looking girl recognized it as the same game that other children had been playing near the arena. It even had the same name. She wondered if it spread from Akihabara, or if it had just spread to Akihabara. Either way, she was ready to play.

<font color = white>&#34;Prepare to lose, Yurei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Ah, right

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's hope this one isn't just for show..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) listens to the explanation of the game.
 <font color = white>&#34;Sounds like it&#39;s based on a roll of the dice.&#34;</font> Therefore in his mind, if he lost, it was only fate.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got this. Their gonna be sowing Mugen dolls until their fingers bleed. Ehahaha.&#34;</font> He laughed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares at the plump youth for a moment.

<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I will await the winner. You'll have to do some poses for me though. I do hope the winner isn't camera shy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) reached into her pocket--

<font color = white>&#34;Actually, I don&#39;t have a dice. Can I borrow one, A&#39;suno?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hrnn

<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: I just need a name and what you need.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) caught the cubes and then, with a twirl, unleashed them onto the ground between them!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Terrible...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) felt to the ground, his rolling luck was habitually low.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How much do sets of shuriken cost?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Back to me, then...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It's over.
