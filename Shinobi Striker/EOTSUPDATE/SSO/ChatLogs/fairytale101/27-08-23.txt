<font color = white>&#34;I am Uchiha, Kohaku- I feel out of place being so young, So Yuuto and Batsu, both kin... I bet we will pass with flying colors then.&#34;</font> He held himself with a standard about him, confident but not one to hide the fact he was still rather shy. if one couldn&#39;t be true to themselves then how could one call themselves an Uchiha? 

He&#39;d whip out a fan from his sleeve shaped like the symbol of their clan to cool himself, <font color = white>&#34;I just hope everyone shows promise this year, in and out of the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
