<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Shiroimu, Shion (The warm man-Limb) Nodding to each as they introduced themselves he pulled out three scrolls and handed them to each student. He then took a fourth one out and revealed the information inside it.

<font color = white>&#34;These are signup scrolls. Please fill these out and have your parents sign them then bring them back. If you do not have parents then sign the second line that states so.&#34;</font>

He points to each section

<font color = white>&#34;The first section is simple. Just your name, age, eye color basic descriptors. The second section goes over what you will be doing while at the academy. The third section is a waiver that states any harm recieved during training courses is not to be used against the academy. The fourth section states that this course is made to raise shinobi of the village and what that entails.&#34;</font>

He smiles once again and rolls the scroll up.

<font color = white>&#34;Feel free to fill these out in your spare time but know that school starts soon so don&#39;t take too long.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Great! Signing up!&#34;</font> He bit his forefinger before writing his information down on the scroll. Just the basics as asked.

<font color = white>&#34;Umm, for this doing part is like what we aiming to learn?&#34;</font> He asked.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...You speak dog?&#34;</font>, he asked, his eyes settling on the animal once again.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) has decided to take a walk from the compound of his clan to the Kage manor where he was supposed to sign up for the academy and figure out what is going on in this village nowadays. Since he became of age to join Shinobi ranks, Gosame was really excited and eager to meet new people.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what my boss would say to this...maybe I should wait for him?&#34;</font>

He would think while walking with his hands firmly placed at back of his head. Step by step he was slowly in front of the manor where he wonders what this group of people has gathered around for. In a friendly manner he smiles and joins them.

<font color = white>&#34;Erm...hello. I am Gosame and I am looking for someone to sign me up in the academy?&#34;</font>

Tall boy inquires, his skin was slowly turning blue as well due to their pigmentation that Hoshigaki get once when they become of age.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods towards people that replied. He wonders about what to do next since the Academy head was not around which was rather unfortunate.

<font color = white>&#34;I see, well then I will have to go with secondary option....unfortunate.&#34;</font>

Gosame smiles to those that have introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to have heard at least one name...its nice to meet you Sora.&#34;</font>

After saying that with quite friendly tone, Gosame repositions his hands into his hoodie pocket since his hands were slowly going numb.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Mine is Gosame. Gosame Hoshigaki.

<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's how I took it

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looks confused at everyone repeating prey. Were they not understanding the word?

He nodded at the muscle head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Everyone else is prey! We just protect these prey.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Hey uh...I dont like being called prey.
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Geto, Takeshi - for anyone who didn't catch it

<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You're not all the way there are you>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: ?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would shrug his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Right sure....I suppose.&#34;</font> honestly alot of them were quite interesting, but quite a bit out there as well as he would move towards the building sitting down on the sidewalk, leaning against it, as he opened up a bag and took out a book to read.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hm....I mean if you think like that, it could help you fight like you were prey....adrenaline shortcut maybe
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I am not an illusion? Is prey confused?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) sighs and shakes his head, ignoring the further comments of Yoru. This certainly was an interesting group of people, but he had no time for games. He would head to the front of the academy and wait for an instructor to arrive.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where did everyone go?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) was confused a little bit by the arrival of Yoru. He did not know how to teach his kin about the conversation and proper etiquette of other Shinobi in the village that they protect.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh...well....prey is something we hunt down and play with or hunt down and eat....but I am sure that Yoru doesnt mean it on a bad side.&#34;</font>

Gosame has begun to explain, he was wondering just why is Yoru constantly calling people prey. Was he not taught how to talk properly in public? Regardless, he didnt want to be a smartass and call him out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) would cough a few times Yoru&#39;s smell was crazy bad <font color = white>&#34;Hey.. This has to be a crime.&#34;</font> he says his eyes watering a bit.

His hound Kane would Bark at the Smelly teen.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only chuckle. <font color = white>&#34;Why do you think that I am all the way over here chief?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) looks to Gosame with a nod

<font color = white>&#34;Ah I get it...that&#39;s okay, if he treats his enemies as prey, he&#39;ll get along with me just fine!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: If he does not, big boss will put him in place.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only nod to them before turning to the chief. <font color = white>&#34;So, chief whats one gotta do to join the police force anyways, figured I would ask and see what happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's a good question
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Bad side? Prey is prey. No good or bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) stretched her arms over her hea, <font color = white>&#34;Huh.. where did everyone go?&#34;</font> She&#39;d wonder.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Everyone is here, few people left but thats about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) asks: Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looked at the hound, tilting his head.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, prey? Hungry? I&#39;m not prey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) looks over to sora. <font color = white>&#34;To join the force.. The minimum requirement would to be a genin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;We have a long path ahead of us, especially to become Genin. That one is really important.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read his book as he listened to the chief, when his question was answered. <font color = white>&#34;Well that is good to know chief, I might have to join when I am able to then...I think that with my skills I might be a great addition, but of course that also remains to be seen.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: My name?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Yep.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) tilted her head to the side as she eyed the sharp-toothed kid.
     <font color = white>&#34;My name&#39;s Reimi..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) gives Sora a heads up <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods in understanding.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Hoshigaki Gosame. Its nice to meet you Reimi.&#34;</font>

He says with wide and happy smile, he came here to meet new people and sign up to attend the academy and become Genin to begin with.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I knew she lied.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Reimi makes more sense.
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Obviously did you really think Nunya was their name?
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Do I look stupid to you
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Never said you did
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Nunya sounds like a prey name.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: fits well.
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: You probably prey on boys
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: I do not have a preference on gender.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Damn...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: A question though. Did anyone sign up at all? Because if not....we can just camp the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue reading as he flipped to another page. <font color = white>&#34;I believe that is exactly what we are doing currently Gosame.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I signed up!
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: Same.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: I think I signed up?

<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where is it?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: With the instructor, prey.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would point to the big building everyone is infront of.. <font color = white>&#34;This is the accademy, but it was empty when I was inside just a bit ago, still it is good to know a name of someone to look for.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) points to the building next to them with his index finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Apparently, according to the people that have been signed up already that is the academy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: I'm on my way then!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: Thanks!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Here I am again
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But there is....nobody inside I think.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: Where is the instructor?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) looks to the academy and back then blinks.

<font color = white>&#34;What in the...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Least no one was Gosame when I was in there last, and no one seemed to come in and out that I have seen, I can easily go look again
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Indeed it is still empty
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I need to start my training.

<font color = white>&#34;Yoru...one day you will call someone prey and they will beat you up. Be careful.&#34;</font>

<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: And you are...at the top of the food chain?
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Who is us?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) kept his eyes closed while Yoru spoke, <font color = white>&#34;I am definitely training.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) laughs as he puts his hands on his hips and strikes a pose. His family was pretty well known!

<font color = white>&#34;Not me, but my family!&#34;</font> He turned a few times to give a good view of his... fairly normal looks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) just stares at Yoru, his eyes blinking a few times. He would adjust his mask to sit more comfortably on his nose.

<font color = white>&#34;I have no clue what you are talking about?&#34;</font>, he says, before turning his attention to Ishi.

He would hold a few fingers behind his back. 

<font color = white>&#34;How many fingers am I holding up?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) thinks: The prey is just being lazy and sleeping!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) slowly removed his hands from his hips from shock. One eyebrow raised. Surely he was lying? Who didn&#39;t know of his family? Granted he didn&#39;t have too many obvious features!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re... joking... right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) ponders on it for a while before speaking up.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, he is someone who using his family to act like he is strong&#34;</font> He said with a snap of his finger as if he guessed it right.

<font color = white>&#34;I think that is why, he talks like that. Makes sense now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: I-
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) took emotional damage as he paused in shock. The youth wasn&#39;t wrong. He himself wasn&#39;t strong yet... at least not by most people standards... He was just a fledgling, no not even a fledglng yet.

<font color = white>&#34;Y-you&#39;re... wrong! I&#39;m...&#34;</font> his voice got quieter near the end and started to trail off. How would he even respond to such a response? </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#785b5b>Nara, Ishikamaru (The stoic lurker-JCMAce98) sighed out. <font color = white>&#34;Doesn&#39;t matter how much fingers you have up. As long as I know where you are at all times.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I guess.

<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That I did. Met the client and now I have some ryo. I think I will go and purchase a knife with all this talk of crime.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled as he was spot on but no point in trashing someone for no real reason .
<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure you will get strong as time goes on.&#34;</font> He said leaving at that, with a bit of a smirk on his face.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) thinks: I'm still so weak...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) nodded spiritless. He wanted to be strong now! Not later...

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah... later on...&#34;</font> he sighed</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) supressed a yawn with the long sleeve of their kimono. <font color = white>&#34;Welll for now I will turn in.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9900cc>Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) returned before heading to sleep. They knew better than most....proper protection came in numbers.

<font color = white>&#34;Here you are children. Play with these, someone must be responsible around here.&#34;</font> a laugh escaped from the bandaged mouth as they dumped several spinning stars with sharpened edges out</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) took the sharp star and put it away <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not a child..&#34;</font> He while still taking the gift anyways. No hint of shame.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: it is not much. But if crime really is bad in the big village then that should at least discourage a common bandit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) kicks a rock down the street, stopping at the comotion with a pique in interest.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) cheered up somewhat with the gift. Shiny weapons were a step closer to getting strong!

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks, prey!&#34;</font> He shoved them into his pants irresponsibily.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hattori, Kichou (The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) says: That placement wont end well I am sure....as a matter of fact if anyone inquires I did not arm you.

He examines it brilliant shine, his finger tracing the edges of the blade. A small speck of blood would begin to protrude from his finger, as the sharp edge sliced his soft flesh.

He would place the shuriken into his cowl pocket.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Uchiha, Shizuku (The unassuming kid-Zimsham) 's steps were measured and deliberate as she approached the gathering of children. Her gaze remained fixed ahead, her eyes sweeping over the scene without a glimmer of interest. The chatter of the kids was a distant murmur, a background noise that held no sway over her thoughts.

Her features remained unchanged, her face an unmoving mask, as she walked closer to the group. Their voices rose and fell in a rhythm that didn't penetrate her consciousness. Shizuku's expressionless stare remained focused, her mind untouched by their words.

She was lost in a thick train of thought. Her mind set on her father's words and what they meant for her as a young Shinobi of a prominent clan. When the crowd was nearby, she stopped and fixated her stare on the people near her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) thinks: Yeah I can keep a secret!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) looked at Gilly for a second for a second skin as blue as the water he shrugged for a moment as he looked at the kid and then to Sora he started to wonder how the 14 years wasn&#39;t an genin.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh Interesting so we&#39;ll all behind haha, i join late too.&#34;</font> he stated as he prepared the path of becoming a ninja rather than being a cook like his dad.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) To be fair, Gilly didn&#39;t know how old he was. Being only 4&#39;7 and having such soft fish features, one could assume he was anywhere between five and ten. Eitherway, he shrugs his shoulders grinning.
 <font color = white>&#34;Four and teen? That&#39;s pretty old!&#34;</font> 

 He looks over at E nodding. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re four and teen too!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Was it Reimi?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled

<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: ..Man what were you guys talking about.
