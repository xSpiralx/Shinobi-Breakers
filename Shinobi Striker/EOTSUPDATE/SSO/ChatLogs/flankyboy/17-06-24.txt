<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) approaches Sogeki and settles a large hand on their shoulder, his figure towering them easily. <font color = white>&#34;My soldiers do <i>not</i> yield. But I admire such personality.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The hunt will be retracted. Tell me your name.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (i am possessed

The weight of the veteran&#39;s hand on his shoulder is both comforting and imposing, a reminder of the authority he carries. Sogeki meets the veteran&#39;s gaze with a defiant glare, the flames of determination burning fiercely in his eyes despite the fear that churns within him.

He stands his ground, unwilling to show weakness despite the overwhelming presence of the veteran. Sogeki knows the importance of respect in the shinobi world, especially when facing someone of higher rank. Yet, beneath the surface, his resolve remains unbroken, a testament to his unwavering spirit amidst the intimidating atmosphere.

<font color = white>&#34;..of the Satetsu. But soon everyone will call me the Kraken Slayer.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) turns away and eyes Tsukiko.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If my soldier says they will obtain a title then that it is how it will be.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Do you understand?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stared in complete astonishment. Beginning to wonder if this boy named <i>Blast</i> was sent here by some cosmic entity.. Though - sleep or not.. Still or not! 

                         <b><i>HE HAD A JOB TO DO.</b></i>

Manipulating his body in such a dramatic fashion as if he was a <i>snake</i>. His presence looming over behind him. It was time. <b><i>Fifty damned Ryo was at stake!</b></i>
      <i><font color = white>&#34;Pin him down as I~...!&#34;</font></i>

The half-shark would grasp the top of his briefs, wasting no time before hopping over his body soon after. Delivering a <i>vicious</i> <b><i>WEDGIE</b></i>! Certainly giving Asa some flashbacks of his very own from the day prior. Landing over the boy he would stand proud. A grin sprayed over his face.

<b><i>The job.. was done.</b></i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Of course. Though it doesnt have a ring to it like "the Commander".. but it'll be renown.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) shrugged. She wasn&#39;t one to contest her higher-ups.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) landed pathetically and continued walking over towards his friend. His face sprayed in horror.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Have you ever tasted war? The feeling of a life being taken when the last breathe is made?
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (who did you wedgie
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: Because Krakens, in the book, are invasive creature that do nothing but roam and rule the darkness. Amegakure, being the one true light that I will one day lead, must extinguish any and all darkness.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) <font color = white>&#34;Thirst to slay?&#34;</font>

Sogeki thinks for a moment, then shrugs. He eases into the comfort of the topic.
  <font color = white>&#34;I do.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;But not without cause. Even if it&#39;s frowned upon by the public.. if it needs to be done. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (so since he wasn't wearing underwear

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) nods. A good, solid answer. One with valuable foundations. A very good seedling in the making. These things are being noted.
That is his S-rank mission afterall.

The study each of them and gift them tasks and an environment that will benefit their growth.

<font color = white>&#34;Fine,&#34;</font> he starts, squeezing the boy&#39;s shoulder, <font color = white>&#34;Kraken Slayer must be earned.&#34;</font>

A punch occurs, far too fast to be seen by anyone around. It plants into Sogeki&#39;s stomach with cratering force.

His hand falls from the boy&#39;s shoulder, leaving them to relish in the impacts recoil.

<font color = white>&#34;Now. Why do I see someone giving wedgies?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) didn&#39;t care anymore. His face, having been pasted full of horror, stayed facing the ground. His tone speaking as if he was already dead.

     <font color = white>&#34;..Money.. For weapons..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) side-eyes the Hoshigaki whom had fallen victim to the bad example set by the laborer the day before. It was without a doubt that the Commaner was going to indeed enact some sort of wrath upon him for comitting such a heinous crime.

    Whilst everyone was looking towards the Hoshigaki Nahoko stole a moment to check up on her hair in the reflection of the monument north o fher.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh god..

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He's punching people like Miss Botan.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: its a bad sight to see people doing everything for money
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Hide!!
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: You have no choice but to.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) 's eyes were glazed over as he witnessed Sogeki get the air knocked out of him. So much abuse, so much pain. Is this what it means to be a shinobi?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) epicly fails at hiding behind Blast.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) trudged forward, as the command was given.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: (yahoo jutsu r being added slowly!!)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Manaso(The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) OOCs: ( who's ready to learn FTG AND RAIKIRI)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) steps to the side. She gives the half-shark a reassuring pat on the shoulder to help ease the woes he felt; unaware that he was about to get thwarted by the commander himself.
   <font color = white>&#34;I--.. oh,&#34;</font> she says, only to watch him leave on command.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) prayed he <i>at least</i> got the fifty ryo. To pay for his future medical bills or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) yells: PUNISH HIM!!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame(The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) OOCs: (LMAO
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Come over here, boy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) points menacingly at his attempted assaulter.

<font color = white>&#34;..ok.&#34;</font>
Then he waddles over at impecable speed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s body jerks forward as the veteran&#39;s fist slams into his stomach with brutal force. The impact sends a shockwave of pain through him, causing him to grit his teeth and stagger backward. His hands instinctively clutch at his abdomen, trying to alleviate the intense ache that spreads from the point of impact.

Despite the pain, Sogeki locks eyes with the crimson-haired veteran, his gaze unwavering. His pride refuses to let him show weakness or back down, even in the face of such a harsh lesson. He takes a deep breath, swallowing his pride along with the pain, and straightens up slowly, though the discomfort is evident on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand,&#34;</font> Sogeki manages to say through clenched teeth, his voice strained but defiant. He exhales sharply, willing himself to remain composed despite the throbbing pain in his gut. His eyes remain fixed on the veteran, a silent acknowledgment of the respect he holds for the commander&#39;s authority.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: One of you will be punished for unorderly conduct.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Higane.

<font color = white>&#34;You are a scared cat,aren&#39;t you&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The other will be punched in the stomach by Sogeki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) Walked quickly over to the scene about to happen. Someone other than him getting abused by their elder? A sight to behold.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) asks: What are the other options?
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Drainage of your chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: ..I shall take th'brunt of both punishments, if possible.. I am th'cause.. I'll accept th'just rights..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Silence.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Pick one of the three.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: And here I thought shinobi were supposed to take jobs for money...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Th'former.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) stood there silently.

Then he broke the silence.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m confused. Do we still have to be silent?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) regretably shakes her head. <i>How far we have fallen.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) felt bad that Blast-san was being punished but could only watch from a distance as he couldn't save the boy from his fate.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: That'd be hard y'know. Since we have to verbally choose.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Shh...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: If you had like a piece of paper I could point to pick.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He hasn't noticed I was somewhat involved.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) remained otherwise idle as the Hoshigaki made his way through the gathering of shinobi. The actual act wasn&#39;t her end goal here. Unfortunately...

     <font color = white>&#34;Oh.. That&#39;s..&#34;</font>

When he walked back over, she observed his demeanor and that call he made-- She, too, widened her eyes with shock. Not one ounce of her wanted to imagine what that felt like. 

Before she could offer a hand or deliver his justice..

He was gone.

<i>It seems her point had been made.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) asks: Haginane over there also assisted his assault. Is that why we have three options?

<font color = white>&#34;And a oop!&#34;</font> She jolted in a muffled tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Don't you get why she is raising her tone.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: How dare he even speak at such volumes to you. He thinks you're too stupid to say someones name correctly.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I hope he doesn't hurt her too bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) claps his hands together. <font color = white>&#34;Enough. I&#39;ve decided. All three are to be hunted.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

    His arm sliding out of his sleeve as his upper body laid bare. Turning southbound to face Sogeki. The student granted the privilege of hunting and punching him. This was perfectly fine to him.

The neck of his cracked as he readied himself. His right hand raising itself, motioning in a &#39;<i>come on, then</i>&#39; gesture. Thus he spoke finally.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Hunt me? Fine then, let&#39;s do it. Punch me? Do it..</b>&#34;</font>, his finger pointed in Najiro&#39;s direction, his face grinning widely as he continued.
     <font color = white>&#34;<b>This is what it means t&#39;follow orders!!! I want you to hunt me with all yer might.. It&#39;s yer order, Najiro. Whether it&#39;s right or wrong - you commit to it!!!</b>&#34;</font>

               Finally, the gaze of the boy turned back to Sogeki, his grin spreading as his body flared up. His blue-scaled hand beated his chest as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;<b>Let&#39;s not hold th&#39;Commander up. Deliver yer blow.</b>&#34;</font>, he spoke. His hand gesturing to begin this matter, once more.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;..for the Commander,&#34;</font> Sogeki whispers.

The impact of his action is felt heavily in the tense silence that follows, hanging in the air as a testament to the Commander&#39;s authority and the consequences of crossing it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) thought about it. Questions. Questions are important. Questions get answers. Questions like 'How hard is he going to punch Haginini? Is the commander a man or woman? Where are my shoes?'</font></font></font>

        Moving along to the side, letting the next recipient take their turn in receiving the punch from the fellow student, Sogeki.
