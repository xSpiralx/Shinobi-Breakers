<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) felt a twinge of audacious spite creep up on his shoulders. To which he&#39;s forced to answer with his own deftness.
First order of business, getting away from Kamiya--she&#39;s the stronger one of the two, if his memory serves him correctly, so getting away from her would prove advantageous, forcing him to only deal with Sakuya.

He&#39;s never won a fight against her, though today&#39;s the day he might be given the chance to try.
Kamiya is evaded this time, with Sakuya being blocked. He uses Sakuya&#39;s weight to bounce away from the dynamic duo and more toward the riverbanks. The bell sounds, however, he knows the kids won&#39;t relent; and he doesn&#39;t plan on doing so either.
<font color = white>&#34;Coh&#39; aht meh... Bich&#39;s.&#34;</font> He states, as long as Kamiya&#39;s interrupted by Sakuya, he&#39;s safe, somewhat...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) was on his ass. Was she lying about him being faster? It seemed like it...

Just as a punch is about to be thrown to his cranium, though, the dancer twisted her body away and cartwheeled to a standing position.

<font color = white>&#34;I head the academy bell. You&#39;re lucky.&#34;</font> she said, to the fat-tongued boy. <font color = white>&#34;You will apologize to me after class or you&#39;re going to keep getting this.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t a very hard demand to meet, luckily for him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya stopped her assualt. It was time for class.

<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be inconviencing us like this Shun.&#34;</font> She shrugs as she readies herself to leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Siamoa (The rugged indiviual-Game Master Ryuu) felt that it time for the need of rest as he was assured of his legs will be given out any minute now. Rashly plop onto the harden ground with a little discomfort but noting to complain about <font color = white>&#34;Ah much better.&#34;</font>with a enjoyest tone his voice..
