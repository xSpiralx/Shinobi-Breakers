Too easy, Shishorama was probably the most simple person here when it came to being very predictable... The Uchiha would watch as more and more stepped up, a group pooling over time.

Wondering if he should also step up, but he wondered what the Headmaster really meant by elements... What was involved? Most whom stepped up were more durable or stronger from looking by a glance.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pinched his chin as he thought it over. They were not just tasked with climbing to the top but also to see to it that all the others present made it, as well.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Runs up to the mountain and limbers up for a moment getting ready. Wasting no time he jumps up upon the side of the mountain and grabs onto the rocks. A quick glance was given to those who stepped up as well, some girl with white hair and a kid who's name was...Try? That didn't matter, now was not the time to get distracted.

focusing back onto the rock he'd start his climb, his first real moment of the academy. determined not to make a fool of himself the young man doesn't focus on being fast or first, but on consistency. Maybe he wouldn't get to the top first, but he was damn sure going to get there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) pointed at the mountain.

- <font color = white>&#34;All I have to do is beat it up, right?&#34;</font>

Momoko instead moved back and walked to the nearest lake, kneeling close to it, getting a handfull of water and splashing it across her face. She got up, dusted herself off, took her sandals off, set them aside, and looked right back up at the TALL mountain.

Momoko held her fists back, and started to accumulate momentum. . .

Beginning to utilize the infamous Super Peel Out, Trademarked, catching up with speed and boosting at high-mach towards the Mountain! Her hand shot back,

dramatically reaching out towards the rock, with a blitz effect covering up her POV, flames erupting out of her fingertips, GRIPPING on one rock-hard surface!

Momoko started to punch the mountain&#39;s walls, beginning to climb at a ridiculously fast pace, surpassin-

no, wait, she hasn&#39;t even gotten one meter above the ground. Momoko is scratching the surface at comically high speeds and going nowhere, because physics decided they&#39;d specifically fuck her over.

She looks like a feral cat trying to get over some curtains.</font></font></font>

He moved over to his sister, <font color = white>&#34;Time to make up for having me miss my chance last time.&#34;</font> He hinted, eyeing the woman&#39;s blade once again.

&#39;<i>If I can stomach the shock from touching her blade.... I can probably...&#34; The boy&#39;s mute-red hues kept a close gaze, calculating his chances.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) looked at her brother.

<font color = white>&#34;You will throw me up. Then, I will catch you from the top.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Towa (The ashen haired girl-ZenchuZaaRachu) would instead watch for a short while. She wore glasses and held books close to her chest. And darted her eyes across the field upon seeing most of her peers climbing the rock.

She decided to give it an attempt, definately soon.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn't want to use his strength to get a stick but climbing was another thing entirely. He thought that he might as well go ahead and see what he can do when it comes to climbing. He was pretty strong and agile, but beyond that, he lacked in almost every other aspect.

Patting his hands together, he was a bit confused of how to go about it at first, and figured he would just jump for the first big rock he could see. Easily managing to make use of his upper body strength to pull himself up... only to dangle for a few moments trying to find a proper foothold for his feet... well that was a bit embarassing.

Still, he found a spot after a few tries and afterwards, it was bit like smooth sailing till halfway up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Alright!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) draws a long, slow blink before peering up the mountain side. Its large and dangerous crevice would surely be the death of them if one person slipped or failed to grab the right place.

<font color = white>&#34;You should throw me instead and I will catch you.&#34;</font> He doesn&#39;t want to slip and fall to his doom. She was prone to sweat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Good thinking Try.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) narrowed her gaze momentarily, before assuming a careful stance. Her arms are read to grab at his own, and her legs are bent to roll her frame downward to catapult him upward.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay.&#34;</font> The girl replied, bidding him to get a running start.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) gave up trying to climb using her hands.

Momoko walked away and instead approached the closest tree - aggressively kicking the base of it.

A conveniently large-sized tree branch fell off, stabbing the floor beneath her. She is NOT using her brains nor is she trying to use teamwork at all, she's just bashing her face first into it and hoping it works.

And by that, she's now going to use the stick as a trampoline, aligning it just right. She read it in comics, certainly, it can work.

Momoko jumped towards the wall, kicked off it, and dived straight into the stick.  . .

<i>tic</i>.

Only for it to snap like a twig, anticlimatically resulting in nothing happening.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) locked his fingers together with his palms facing upwards and turned his back to the cliff. He didn't need to be the first one up to the next stage of the mountain; this wasn't a race. This was a group effort, and every group needed an anchor! He scanned those gathered for who might take the launch.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) shrugged, that was as good a plan as any he supposed, so he hopped onto the cheerful lad&#39;s back. All they had to do was... get over the mountain by any means.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kohaku of the Uchiha by the way, I hope you&#39;re good at climbing... I am not.&#34;</font> The boy affirmed, knowing his strength lies with using his chakra.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Climbing rocks isn't so hard if you plan it out before you start.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Push with your legs, don't use your arms to try to pull yourself up.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: And use your core to keep your body close to the cliff!
<br><font color=teal>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) thinks: Legs. . .
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) began pushing his sister over between the mountain and Komo.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mooon, you owe me anyway, just help me out witth this okay?&#34;</font> He begs, taking another glance at the Chuunin in hopes she doesn&#39;t walk off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) || Climb up that mountain? It looks more like a plateau. How in the world is he going to do this? And more importantly- How is he going to get the others up there as well? 

He watched as everyone grappled with their own approaches, attempting various methods to conquer the vertical terrain. And then, as if a puzzle piece snapping into place, an idea took shape in his mind. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, the cogs of his mind whirring.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm. . .&#34;</font> He mused aloud. A lightbulb flickered above his head as an idea finally kicked in, he projected his voice even louder.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, folks!&#34;</font> His tone raised, hoping that everyone would heed his words.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s take turns giving each other a boost, and then use the human chain we create to pull up the stragglers. We&#39;ll make it together that way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: But I don't have any chains.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is glad this was so readily accepted. The pale student moves himself back, as close to the water as he can manage without risk of slipping and falling in before suddenly charging forward.

With the running start he will draw closer to his sister before anticipating where she holds the flats of her palm, awaiting the leverage to send him skyward with a press of the foot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With utmost confidence, Shishorama stands tall and unwavering before the formidable mountain. She flexes her fingers, producing a satisfying crackling sound, and rotates her neck to loosen any tension before taking a determined step forward. Despite being presented with a daunting task, she took it upon herself to undergo it. 

Shisho charges towards the towering rock formation. As she approaches, she reaches out to touch its rugged surface, feeling the rough texture under her fingertips. Though the task seems daunting, with nothing but her own strength and unwavering resolve, she sets out to climb it, determined to conquer the daunting challenge.

With a steady pace and an unwavering smile, she ascends the mountain, pushing herself to her natural limits. The sweat on her face and the strain in her muscles are clear signs of the effort she is putting into the climb. Nevertheless, she refuses to be defeated by the physical toll and makes her way to the top.

<font color = white>&#34;ARGGHHHHH!&#34;</font> The intense young woman <b>ROARS</b> at the top of her lungs once the pinnacle had been reached, claiming her victory among the students that remained at the bottom of the rocky formation. 

<font color = white>&#34;HERE STANDS, SENJU SHISHORAMA! SUCCESSOR OF THE WILL OF FFIIIIIIRRREEEEE!!!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) , with his hands still linked together to provide a boost and his back to the cliff face turned and looked to the late bloomer. <font color = white>&#34;Great idea! I&#39;ll boost you up first, then you can help pull them up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) asks: What do you need me to do?
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: Alright, that's one- There's two.
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) asks: Anyone else want in?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I can push or I can go up and pull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) struck with perfect timing, suggesting that these acrobatic feats were practiced often-- or else, the pair shared some instinctual link, giving them the sort of frame-perfect coordination required to achieve this. Either way, in one graceful, fluid motion the girl rolled and the boy was boosted, propelled by both palms and feet high into the air; he'd be able to make it up for sure.

The dancer, for her part, is quick to get off the ground and brush the dirt from her clothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: In>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) stared at the bloodly samurai that just snapped a branch from the tree. She points to the ground before speaking.

<font color = white>&#34;If ya&#39;ll get hurt or something, just use nature&#39;s bandaid. Rub some dirt on it.&#34;</font>

She said, as she examined the other groups. Some were trying to work together, not a bad plan. Probably the most easiest way to complete a task, however it depends on the core strengths of the members for it to be a success.
  Komo would step her way around the groups of academy students, plugging her ears when she made her way by the Intense Senju, watching him head to the top of the mountain.

  Clan strength was truly something else...

She watched as others adopted the samurai&#39;s tactics, using their surroundings to climb such a object.

<font color = white>&#34;Resourceful.&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: Either role works, just that I'll be counting on the physically strongest to reel in the rest.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) Although the Uchiha hand't found a good spot to continue to climbing, he managed to see one just out of reach. He had an idea of what to do and wanting to show himself capable, he tried to get to it straight away...but... there was some hesitation as he would need to jump and be airborne for a moment, if he missed, he was screwed.

The fall wasn't THAT great though, so with his heart speeding up, he took a deep breath and made a leap, hands shooting forward eagerly, almost desperately for the crevice that would allow him to continue on.

Afterwards, he had to take a few deep breaths to calm down and continued on! Now he wasn't as a fraid as before, and just as he was about to reach the top, he heard Shishorama's screams of excitement.

He was just a bit too late for it. Well, next time!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) looked up towards the cliffside with a gulp.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow.&#34;</font> he says softly, tugging at his collar. They&#39;d look around to the others, looking for reactions perhaps. He had hoped to see others as worried as he was, hoping to not seem TOO out of place with his fear of heights.

<font color = white>&#34;O-okay!&#34;</font> he said, marching towards the mountain now. He studied the rock&#39;s face with intensity, planning his way before actually even trying. They saw nooks and crannies that would potentially fit his hands and feet. After awhile of putting together a strategy, he&#39;d move!

One hand stretched up first, his foot following after as it placed itself in a crack along the rocks. Not even ten feet up he&#39;d look down, eyes becoming wide as he saw the ground below.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh...&#34;</font> he sighed, looking back up now. contiuing the climb with a slow pace. He wouldn&#39;t rush it, just knowing he only had to reach the top and wasn&#39;t asked to do so with haste. Finally, he would grasp a hand on the top of the cliff, pulling himself up to the top shakily. 

<font color = white>&#34;I-I did it!&#34;</font> he&#39;d roar, looking down the cliffside before fainting, falling on his backside from the fear it had induced!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I can pull then.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll go up first.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Climbing climbing climbing this was turning out to be easier than expected, but then again what kid didn&#39;t like to climb on things? Despite this being labeled as official training it was nothing new to the young kid. He had spent many days in the past running around the village and climbing to places he probably shouldn&#39;t have.

Reaching out with his hand and pushing up with his legs, a boundless stamina allowed the kid to continue up the mountain with little trouble, it was only about passing the halfway point did he hear Shishorama yell out....damn she had beaten him. Oh well, it didn&#39;t matter. 

Reaching the top of the first track he looks back and only now realizes how high up they really were....perhaps this was a bit different from the school yard. Regardless he yells down 

<font color = white>&#34;Right I&#39;ll help anyone else up &#34;</font> he offers to the ones below.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is launched and that, folks, was all that she wrote. His slight frame coupled with quantum mechanics and some other shit leads to him getting to a pretty solid place on the mountain. Yet, with a particularly large rock he will have to cling to in order to hold on.

His arm is over the base of it and all of his strength is used to keep himself there. Thus, he turns, <font color = white>&#34;Jump now.&#34;</font> Otherwise it will be for nothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#884250>Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) gives a beaming smile and turns towards the mountain, not entirely paying attention to formalities <font color = white>&#34;That crevasse will make a decent spot!&#34;</font> he states excitedly, not wanting to expend too much energy for when he comes to collect others.
 He beings to climb using the crack, leisurely climbing as he hums a tune..  Untill he starts to stagger a bit quickly checking up on the Uchiha on his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Make sure to hold on as tight as ya can!&#34;</font> He shouts and before long.. with a few near stumbles, but a generally calm climb, the two make it up beside the others at the top.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clapped her hands, the noise a resounding acknowledgement of his words. She's got a target to leap to and intends to make it there. A quick look around found her a branch, and the little eleven year old wielded it with impossible strength as she took a step back and then ran forward. Her pole finds the sandy ground of the river bank and lets her careen forward. Deftly, she jumped from it, and one small arm found itself reaching.

She grabbed at his wrist, thudding into the mountain harshly. 

That should have hurt, but she didn't make a sound. Moments later, she's found herself some footholds, and they've got a signfiicant headstart on the mountain.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) put his plan into motion. Leaning his back against the wall and adopting a squatting stance, he formed his hands into a makeshift platform, ready to serve as a human springboard. This would give the more physically capable members, the Samurai and the Youth a chance to utilize their strength not just to gain height, but also to secure a grip on a ledge, providing a sturdy foundation for their climb.

If the pieces fell into place as hoped, the Samurai and the Youth would lift him up next, a sequence that would repeat as they ascended. His own role came next  using his position as a link, connecting the chain formed by the others. Depending on their willingness and ability, either the Youth or the Samurai could be the anchor and hook.

He acknowledged that not everyone would be on the same wavelength as him, so he proceeded with those who were on the same page. His personal charisma might influence some, but he understood its limits.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Just hold up a moment, we'll be right down there to help ya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;--&#34;</font>

Shun&#39;Ichi shot his sister a scathing glare, mouthing inaudibly an <i>I&#39;ll do it myself</i> in her general direction before taking a glance to the mountain.

Three problems would arise, well--two and a half problems. First, there&#39;s no chance he&#39;s proficient enough to climb the mountain with these heavy clothes, and he doesn&#39;t have spares to replace them with--so no chance in a quick change.
Second: Komo&#39;s sword being flowed with some sort of chakra, being completely unaware of how chakra functions, the punk&#39;s simply going to have to go through with counteracting that... Somehow. 
He spits in his hands, rubbing the saliva together in order to produce an adequate amount of friction for the rough mountain walls to feel less abrase. In any case, the half problem comes to what Komo&#39;ll do if he&#39;s successful.

Assuming he&#39;ll even get close to grabbing her blade from the top of the mountain.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, climbing, that&#39;s easy... Yeah...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We're starting a chain.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We'll boost up and pull others up.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: You guys can be the next level up.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Oh! Nice idea.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) clumsily rushes down the cliff face. After reaching the half-way point, she slips on a rock and tumbles down a flight. With a loud oof, the girl splatters against the stone ground. Bleeding from her skull as she was, she eagerly hopped to her fellow students and extended a steady hand to whoever might be needing assistance!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll help you! I&#39;ll help all of you!&#34;</font> She beams proudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) sat down and thinks. It was ethier let someone carry him up there or just fail.<font color = white>&#34;Uh  guess I sit here and wait..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll hang out in the middle until we get everyone up.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Leans down now and lays flat upon the mountain to steady himself as much as possible. Taking off his coat he quickly ties it to a nearby rock to anchor himself. Once all the set he leans over to the two white haired students below him.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright just get to me and I&#39;ll help pull you up&#34;</font> he calls down to them. It was a good idea Try had to help others out, and he could see even now the others were coming down to help as well. The class just might make it to the top.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We can go together.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: Fine...
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: We should dig up some dirt and push it against the cliffside for slightly higher ground to start with.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Remember! It's not a race but a team effort!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) Momoko dusted her hands off, took a few steps back, and hopped once - The momentum of her fall being used to start a jog, and soon a sprint, running straight up into the Bloomer's trampoline -

Getting leverage to LEAP up high into the next 'floor'.

Her hand reached out to the Overconfident Kid, trying to hold and hang to him!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) get's lifted up and followed the busy browed guy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) doesn't allow her to thud at all, in actuality. When she's snatched onto his extended hand, gripping him by the wrist the boy seems to swing with all of his momentuous strength (which wasn't much) and hurls the pale haired girl higher.

Oh baby, it was ice climbers time.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled his scarf off from around his neck and tied it around his waist. He offered the other end to the chill young boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Are you sure?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll go up and you can come up behind me.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: We'll get there together! Yos!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) continued her observation of the students making their way to the top, some finally realizing the second part of this lesson. However, this exercise could be a little tough for the first day; but many of them already proved her wronng.
She held her staff close as some even got a few scratches along the way.

Komo's eyes were like an eagle, peering at every situation that could happen. Her thumb rubbing against the hilt of her staff - Red staining her thumb print as well as the hilt's steel end.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was kneeling by the edge together with Shishorama, just waiting for the first person that would be sent that way. The moment the first one came, he immediately reached out to firmly grab the hand of that samurai and pull them up on the second floor. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, now let&#39;s boost you up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) holded the tie. This was going to be ethier fine or a rough day.<font color = white>&#34;Damm be careful man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh okay...&#34;</font> he gulped, looking back down the cliffside before trying to climb back down. He aimmed to join the student made totem pole, trying to allow the others an express route up the cliffside along the others.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t let me fall!&#34;</font> he says, gripping onto the stone&#39;s face.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaoru(The late bloomer-SonikkuX) OOCs: (Alright, the order is Samurai > Bushy Brows > Me and whoever else jumps up with us)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) safely landed, now instead, keeping the grip she had. She looked down at the Bloomer and the Dweeb -

Stretching her hand out to them, leaning in to the edge of the cliff! She's going to catch anybody that springs up to her height.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) is caught off guard, flying upward with a hefty momentum. Arms and legs scramble as she makes it just short of the edge, both arms grabbing onto a rocky outcropping. There&#39;s even more scrambling, as her grip shifts from two arms to two legs wrapped around the out-jutting, earth spike. She hung upside down like a monkey, arms both held out to catch her brother.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re going to the top.&#34;</font>

She could easily make it there from here, after all.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) took the boost step the late bloomer offered, planting his foot between his linked fingers before stepping up and taking the added height. He reached up and grabbed handholds in the cliff face with his rough and calloused fingers before peering around for a good route.

Thankfully, other students had already made the climb so he was beginning to see the path best to take. With a final cinch on the scarf at his waist Try looked down to the chill kid. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s just one step at a time.&#34;</font> He then began to work his way up, careful not to get too far from the chill kid in case something happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (is the ashen haired girl afk

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: You guys found the best routes to take. Now, we just have to follow your lead.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) moves to the only side that had no one to help. Since Try and the others had it covered. He moved to be on the left in case those white haired kids needed a hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm not sure how to help you right now, but I'm here if you need me!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We'll take the help when we get close.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: The scarf came in handy.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: The best tool is the one you've got, right?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: huh...well I suppose thats one way to get up.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: To think I'd learn a lesson here! I need to put that in my notes!
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I have hands.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) nods. <font color = white>&#34;To the top,&#34;</font> A unanimous decision, born from an already understood agreement that they did not need to be first. Simply that they needed to get there. So he will prepare himself mentally as she hangs from a point of leverage.

He jumps, pushing off of the large rock and closer to his counterpart. His hand extends, ready to grip.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) shook his head. Grabing the scarf he just followed his lead. Simple right? He did not look down just for his sake. Looking down would made it worse for himself. Literally he could not give up even if he wanted to. He was locked in with the busy browed. No going back.

<font color = white>&#34;Are we there yet...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Oooo, we're close buddy!

<br><font color=red>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) increases their stamina by Full - 15 / 15.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: right...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) climbed up another few paces. He reached the midpoint between where he was previously and where Momoko and Shishorama were waiting with their hands outstretched. 

The dweeb was dirty and sweaty now with trickles of the stuff running down his temples and forehead to his masculine and handsome eyebrows where they were swept aside from his eyes as evolution intended. Try rubbed his head off his shoulder to scratch and itch and felt around for a hand hold he was confident in.

Once he felt secure he turned and looked down, breathing hard but feeling good. With one free hand he reached for the chill young boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) dug his palms into the mountain, feeling a rush of wind coming from the Kaguya duo gave him an idea... He let off a short hop, pinching the wall further as his legs stood parallel to his arms; he wondered if he could quickly switch position to dart up the wall backwards. Besides, given the amount of people congregating about, he can properly formulate a distraction adequate enough for him to compensate for his sister&#39;s lack of support.

He quips to himself on how quickly he darts, gaining a sense of confidence in his plan, he watches Komo&#39;s weapon as if it were prey, greediness hinted throughout his eyes, before he knew it, he was directly underneath the solemn youngster, accidentally grabbing ahold of the character&#39;s leg and losing some balance.

<font color = white>&#34;Shi--&#34;</font> He curses, quickly utilizing the youngster&#39;s weight to his advantage and flipping onto the first protrusion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod holding on as he was carried up- The distance from the ground got wider as the lad climbed, <font color = white>&#34;This would be easier if I could use my chakra to scale this thing.&#34;</font> He stated while looking down, while this happened he&#39;d just focus on molding his chakra for practice... No point in doing nothing while he was being hoisted into the air... One mountain side scale lead to another as he just looked down from above.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder how i would&#39;ve got up her without much climbing experience...&#34;</font> As he would eventually wonder how to help the others, <font color = white>&#34;Now how do I help them make their ways up here...&#34;</font> This would be easier wwith rope, maybe holding out his hand to help peole over the edge would be enough?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Once you can reach me you can reach them.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) caught him. There&#39;s no preservation of momentum, though that may have been easier. What followed was an almost impossible display core strength. Her legs remain hooked over the rock as if two heavy weights.  There&#39;s a look of focus and strain on her face as she used the power of her core to swing him back and forth, building up power with every sway until she&#39;s nearly teetering off her perch...

And then he&#39;s hurled skyward. As she freed him, she used this same momentum to mount the cropping she had wrapped herself around and jump to the next platform.

<font color = white>&#34;Watch out!&#34;</font> She called, to anyone who might be in the way of her flying brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) watched the brother and sister, unable to help it, he nodded in admiration. <font color = white>&#34;Well damn, that&#39;s cool as hell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) eagerly awaited Try and company&#39;s approach. She was able to use this time wisely to regain her composure and strength enough to assist them when the time came.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hey. We should fashion some rope together if we can.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: else has something...
<br><font color=red>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) just reduced their stamina by a cost of D - 2 / 5
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: - I think the person behind me is wearing a scarf!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) caught the Bushy Dweeb with one single grasp, firmly holding him with little to no difficulty. Her muscles bulked, tensing as she grit her teeth, launching her head back to fully PULL him right down!

Now she&#39;d stretch her hand out to the chill young boy, alongside the bloomer.

- <font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mon. Jump. Do it.&#34;</font>

- <font color = white>&#34;If you ever, fall, just don&#39;t.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Wah!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) was coincidentally the unfortunate victim in the sibling duo's way, though his miniscule weight and strength would prove null to their cause, instead counteracting his own attempt to stay on the platform and knocking him airborne, tumbing down the mountain in a mixture of curses and whines.

Back to square one.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) gulped, slowly untying his scarf before handing it over.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t rip it.&#34;</font> he says softly, passing it along.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Im gonna go a level lower, dont fall!

Still it was almost like the punk was trying to pull him. Reguardless as his wrist was grabbed he&#39;d start to pull up bringing the Punk with him. only them to get knocked down...damn <font color = white>&#34;Push with your feet&#34;</font> he orders before turning to the side. 

<font color = white>&#34;Grab. My. Hand.&#34;</font> he calls out to the punk</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Come on, you can do it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) watched as the siblings slingshotted one to the skies, it seemed. She quickly held out a single handseal as her chakra engulfed her feet. Komo seemingly disappeared out of sight, merely to reappearer to the end destination of the flying boy.
  Just the first day, she wasn't intending in doing paperwork to explain why one of the students was in the hospital wing...

The Chuunin would appear inbetween the punk with twin scarves and the pale red-eyed boy. Extending her arms towards each of them in the attempts to prevent such a collusion.

(Shunshin.)</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Easy... Ya'll can't be going in reckless.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is certainly lacking in the department of core strength. No, his talents lie in the more acrobatic side of things. The impossible angles, the ease of access in which he could fit into cramped spaces, that sort of thing.

But as he billows through the air, momentum carrying him high, higher and to the highest peak their combined abilities could bring the both of them, he tucks and rolls into a standing finish when the time to land came.

He&#39;s covered in gravel and dirt but he was here. <font color = white>&#34;Can you jump?&#34;</font> He calls down to his sister! From this high even she would need some sort of miracle to simply clear the distance.

--, he turns to the cheerful one. <font color = white>&#34;Can you dangle me?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: I will hang and catch my sister. If you can.

With him being one of if not the last to get up, he proceeded to. . .Walk away?

He needed to make some distance, is all. He simply needed to 'wind up' before he begins moving.

<i>TAP</i>  <i>TAP</i>  <i>TAP</i>  <i>TAP</i> <i>TAP!</i>

He builds up a massive amount of speed, running swiftly towards the cliffside! And with a mighty leap, empowered with all that momentum he's gathered, he attempts to grab onto somebody's hand if they can reach him in time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) diligently scoured the area for any item that could aid her in her mission. Suddenly, the wandering child offered a scarf that caught her attention. Grateful for the unexpected gift, Shishorama tightly wrapped it around her hand. She then proceeded to lean down the treacherous cliff face and extended the scarf with all her might, hoping that Try would grasp onto it so that it would help them advance.

<font color = white>&#34;Come on, Try!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She had little time to stew over it before being approached by one of her likely classmates. She eyed him up--

<font color = white>&#34;You know gymnastics?&#34;</font> She asked, suspiciously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) sighed.

He had put his faith in the person.Trust or will of fire. Whatever worked he moved quick to be lifted.


<font color = white>&#34;Never again...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) saw the bloomer leap and swiftly reach out, with her own arm swinging like a fishing hook to firmly grasp his wrist, the type of shit you&#39;d see in Action Movies with sequences exactly like this.

A vicious, potent and strong arch from her arm, similarly to a clothesline, intent on not only grappling the bloomer, but also throwing him to her in one single go with the arch it was doing!

There is only little difficulty to her grasp, as she LAUNCHED the man right up to where they stood!

Meaning, he's stuck, so close, yet so far away.. Once they touched ground, Shun'Ichi slipped from the Chuunin's grip, adjacent to his target. He had, involuntarily, successfully scaled the mount--however, his test was far from over...</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) turned and reached up on the cliff face for any sort of hand hold that would bare his weight even as he slid the fishing rod over his shoulder. He then took a step up, digging the toe of his sandal into the stone face and turning his foot so that he had more surface touching. With a hop he reached another hand-hold and began the systematic climbing of the cliff. He was warmed up now but he was also a little fatigued, so this was just as hard, if not harder, than the first level, and the stakes were much higher. 

Slowly, but surely he worked his way up to the next level. The distance was farther than before but the group was counting on him. Shishorama even cheered for him and let him make the climb first! She trusted him!

The youth winced and hissed as his forearms started to cramp up and his hands went numb with charlie horses but he continued on, stopping only to shake his hands when he felt confident he could hold himself up.

Once Try weakly pulled himself over the top he laid flat on his stomach and took big, gasping breaths for air.

A long moment later the fishing line and scarf were lowered down to the chill boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) doesn't grab her on the way up, no. She had been fired off with much too much force to try and slow her down. He could only watch as the pale girl shoots up and over him, to which he turns and waddles in place, determining where she would fall.

Her lightness worked to his advantage in this department. It was very simple to ease her falling into a simple motion, swinging himself around with the excess inertia and planting her firmly on the rocky, cliffside ground.

<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Go Team go! You can do it!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: C'mooooon, lemme try.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: So, Shisorama's catching you at the top, right?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Shishorama!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Yelling is undignified, though...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Negative. Focus on your task right now.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's right!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Your team is waiting.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: I made it up and I've got this fishing line!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'll catch- Yes, Try?!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: Damnit... And-- "Team"?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'm going to pull that lighter guy and then we'll pull people up.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You have a fishing line?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) watched as the newcomers arrived.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh boy, maybe this means we can breathe for a minute.&#34;</font> he says in a hushed tone, watching the group begin to stratigize their climb. They&#39;d then think about the climb he was about to embark once more, having to face his fear of heights head on.

<font color = white>&#34;O-okay...&#34;</font> he mumbles, turning to face the cliff&#39;s edge once more. He&#39;d look around for those helping the others, aiming to use their strength to aid his efforts.

<font color = white>&#34;P-please don&#39;t drop me.&#34;</font> he gulps, sweating as he continued on up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: It's not mine!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's so clever!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Look around you.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: I wish I thought of that...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: It's that chill young guy's!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: He came prepared.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I need to take more notes!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm ready to cach you guys!
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: Screw dignity! Cheer for em loud- Oh seems they are takin the.. taller route- let me just,  get back up there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) made it to the top, now, next to her brother. She looked to help Yuuto ascend himself, but noted that he had gone all the way down to the bottom again. With a sigh, the dancer realized just how long this exercise would take and laid down on the rocky mountain top in exhaustion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Cracking his neck he walks up to the mountain once again, digs his hands into the earth and starts to climb. It seemed his efforts to help were largely ignored, ah well it didn't matter. He had his rest and with that he was off. Grabbing rock after rock he'd push up with his legs and scale the mountain just as he had before. Unlike the others he didn't need help.

Slowly but surely he'd make it to the top, that's all that really mattered to him right now.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) asks: eh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) used the fishing line and the scarf to climb. Using his stamina , he focus on the task at hand. He did not need any distractions. To complete the task and forget  all the nonsense behind him. That was the easy enough to do. No hesitation or worry.

Climbing up carefully using the fishing rod and scarf he noticed that this was not bad after all.<font color = white>&#34;This was too much excerise jeez...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#884250>Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) starts to climb, ending up near Try <font color = white>&#34;Ill help ya pull em up!&#34;</font> the boy says excitedly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) asks: Where you...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Make sure you aim straight up, Yuuto! I wouldn't want to see them drop!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) squints . . .</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I would land on my feet even if I fell.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) looks down at the bottom and then to his sister, <font color = white>&#34;Surprised you were helped. Congratulations.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) helped the wandering boy and then the chill young boy up with the fishing line and scarf combination. He then choked up on the fishing rod so that all those up there could pull together on the fishing line.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;re ready to help up whoever&#39;s next! Just don&#39;t try to climb up two at a time or you might snap the line!&#34;</font> He tossed the scarf/fishing line saddle down to Momoko.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: She's a cat!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: Meow.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Not a good cat!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: Oh. I have a fishing pole as well!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: I see. I'll try harder next time.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) clasped her hands!

<font color = white>&#34;<i>O-kaaay</i>... so we&#39;re jumping it! We&#39;re really doing this. Huh. I, uh, I swam like twice before arriving here, soooo sorry if I&#39;m a little heavy! Water-logged.&#34;</font> 

As she stated as much, she took some generous steps back. <font color = white>&#34;Oh-- and slippery. I apologize in advance if I slip and knee you in the throat, nose, and or forehead in the process! The Officer&#39;s to blame. She took us everywhere-- even through a river-- trying to find this place!&#34;</font> 

One self-deprecating chuckle later and she&#39;s ready to give it a go. From the edge of the river, she fell into a sprint, her sandals clacking and crunching across the sediment, leaving a trail of wet footprints in her path. 

<font color = white>&#34;CatchmeCatchmeCatchme--!&#34;</font> 

She skips a jump, expecting the confident boy to give her the boost she needed to go flying up the elevation-- and to be perfectly honest, she had zero idea what comes after that, since she got a bit distracted! Wait-- there&#39;s a fishing line? 

If so, she&#39;d reach out to grab that and or the cliff-side. Whichever came first!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Two fishing lines then!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: Why are you surprised?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We can really speed this up.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: I'm pretty. Who wouldn't help me?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) looked downward once more, watching the others help each other before wandering over to help Try and the other Lad. He could at least pull with the bit of strength he DID have, even if it wasn&#39;t a lot.

<font color = white>&#34;Let me help, too... I&#39;m not the strongest physically but I&#39;m not useless at pulling.&#34;</font> The Uchiha stated, he got up easy but he was going to pull his weight in this exercise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) follows suit, but... The problem still lies in the fact that the punk never got the chance to swipe the Chuunin&#39;s staff... Oh well, there&#39;s always next time, plus, his sister isn&#39;t around to be shocked or poked with it, so there&#39;s no fun in taking it now.

Well, assuming that Komo won&#39;t allow him to even consider grabbing the staff unless he gets through the &#39;&#39;<i>teamwork</i>&#39;&#39; bit, he inhales sharply, calling out to the two siblings.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey! I&#39;m coming up after yah!&#34;</font> The Boy unveils his scarves, placing rocks between them to form a sling, he spins the scarves about before launching them up, <font color = white>&#34;Grab &#39;em and dig em into the wall!!&#34;</font> He commands, he wasn&#39;t able to gauge their prowess, but judging from the fact that they&#39;re up there and he&#39;s down here, it&#39;s a well aligned gamble.

<font color = white>&#34;Maybe these clothes weren&#39;t a bad choice...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: It was the exact thought on my mind.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (I'll RP after Yuuto)
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: They'll do anything for a pretty face. Poor Uchiha...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Fishing wire...Not what I expected from joining the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) nodded before removing the fishing rod from his back.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, I&#39;ll cast down then.&#34;</font> he says before pulling the rod back, throwing it forwards to cast the line down the wall!

<font color = white>&#34;G-grab it!&#34;</font> he&#39;d call down to whoever wanted to ride the fishing pole express.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Someone's arrogant.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Wait... clothing...
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Well, it's only the first day.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: I this is only day one I ponder what the future holds.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t expect the girl to be wet, but hey, he would help her anyway. The moment she got close, his hands would go under her feet quite easily before launching her upwards towards Shishomaru&#39;s general direction. <font color = white>&#34;Next one!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is conversing but does extend over to clench the scarf between his fingers. He leans over and tugs, pulling back so as to give the punk at least some measure of a foundation to climb on.

<font color = white>&#34;Dig them in with what, stranger? No, you will climb and do so quickly.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Isnt going to be boring.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) laughs a bit.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) unwraps his Kimono&#39;s sash, he could use this to help pull people up, too.

<font color = white>&#34;This should work.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) yells: Ah- Maybe throw it down to the lass helping people from the bottom!
<br><font color=green>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) says: ...Somehow-
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Mmm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) <font color = white>&#34;Hmm.&#34;</font> She lazily caught the scarf flung over her, and held it with not nearly the same conviction as her brother. She rolled over and laid on the scarf, trapping it under her body and between her legs as she scooted behind her brother, acting as an anchor to prevent him from sliding back, as long as he kept himself from sliding forward. It was a little extra weight for him, but...

He could handle it, huh?

<font color = white>&#34;Better hurry.&#34;</font> She called. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m letting go in fifteen seconds.&#34;</font>

Maybe it was her idea of a motivational speech?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) observed the given trajectory of the girl-turned missile for the moment, all the way to her zenith. The wailing was amusing enough it drew a gentle smile across her lips, but she didn't bother to voice her amusement in any way. Rather, she wandered over to take her spot after Hajime, waiting for his own leap to either soar, or flop.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes a deep breath.

Once Hanako manages to rise up to the next level of the cliff, he suddenly steps forth. With practiced movements, he leaps onto Yuuto and he is boosted upwards...!

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s go...!&#34;</font>

An arm extends, to try to reach the cliff-side, or Shishorama&#39;s hand... Despite the fact that he didn&#39;t actually want to accept her help.

Hopefully, he wouldn&#39;t hesitate in reaching for her and fall to a grave injury!

He was also wet, due to the river they swam through.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With an eager expression on her face, Shisho stood at the edge of the cliff, her eyes fixed on Yuuto as he prepared to boost the first person up. Her smile grew wider as she watched Hanako approach, pleading to be caught as she was sent soaring towards the ledge.

Shishorama extends her arms out toward the girl and catches her with effort. Gently placing her to the side, she awaits the next person to be assisted. 

This pattern would continue until every single student made their way up the 'mountain'.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (Shishorama, Hajime rp'd, you can get on that too
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (that RP  shall encompass all incoming students)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (very well, saves time
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Nice to see you here, Hajime!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (We got the double fishing line elevator up on this end)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (and 5 people pulling)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (So you can just poof up here)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's that?
<br><font color=teal>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: yep
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Why's what?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says:  Nevermind..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Thanks, I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: No problem!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Hehe...! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) took her turn once Hajime was seen to the top of the plateau. There was very little fanfare as far as she was concerned, her movements almost painfully efficient. One might even have gotten the impression she could scale the wall rather easily without any assistance at all.

And yet, she boosted through Yuuto's assistance, and extended both arms to grasp onto Shishorama, the zenith of her jump only barely missing the height of the ledge. Perfectly calculated to be easy, and swift.

A nod was offered to the pair then, even if she had to lean over the edge a bit to show her gratitude to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) frowned without much to do in this case, it was mainly just watching as he trained with his chakra. it wasn&#39;t the worst thing but he was wondering what to do while he waited for people to pull up.

On the upside when there was someone to pull wwith five people pulling it asn&#39;t too difficult even if he lacked raw strength. As he heard someone whisper he&#39;d nod toward the Wandering Child.

<font color = white>&#34;Still would be easier if I could use chakra to help in this case.&#34;</font> He doubled down on that aspect.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Chakra..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gave a thumbsup to the eccentric girl after she reached the top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: meh
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: . . .Yes, Chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Alright!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) seemed entirely unafraid of zooming right into being tossed several meters into the air. An underdeveloped aversion to danger perhaps. Who knows! 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, wow. I made it! Thanks!&#34;</font>

After getting properly yoinked and placed to the side like luggage (with a fragile label on it), she found herself delivered to the next stage! A system of fishing line pulleys meant to lift them the rest of the way. Uh--

<font color = white>&#34;Are these really strong enough to hold an entire person? Eh. We&#39;ll see!&#34;</font>
 
As the designated crash test dummy, she twisted a double-wound grip around the fishing lines and held tight!

<font color = white>&#34;<i>O-kaaaay</i>, reel me up!&#34;</font> 
She lets them work their give-man-strong magic!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Hanako(The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) OOCs: [five-man-strong*]
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Alright guys. In sync.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The ole HEAVE HO!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: This is wonderful!
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: H-HEAVE!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: HO!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Goooo!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) takes steps towards the fishing line and merely observes for a few moments, to see if it truly worked exactly like it was supposed to.

<font color = white>&#34;Huh... This is pretty smart... If the fishing line holds, that is.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Heave!!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) began tugging back on the rod with EVERYTHING he had.

<font color = white>&#34;Lets do this!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) rolled his eyes, abjuring to their remarks. Though, it seemed they in fact weren&#39;t on the strong suit, food for thought he supposed.

There was an advantage to this feat, however; Shun&#39;Ichi was going to do something unorthodox to his experience: he was attempting to mimick Komo&#39;s Body Flicker, albeit with only the process of controlling chakra.

Assuming the lady wouldn&#39;t simply show him again, Shun&#39;Ichi improvised.
He remembers reading a bit on the tiger seal; the de-facto sign to focus chakra within the human body; Shinobi works was more his sister&#39;s talent, however the prospect of chakra control always intruigued him.
Time to display that feat in full flux; with his feet upon the wall and the centre of balance upon his heart--Shun&#39;Ichi placed his index and middle fingers on each hand together, and closed his eyes.
Five seconds pass, he recognizes a spark of energy within his belly, chakra.
Ten seconds now, each second is taken spreading chakra throughout his body, before sending it primarily to his legs.
Five more seconds, he feels a sensation unfamiliar to his physical body; and it provides slack for his heart, the chakra to his feet seem to be stitching him to the mountain.

Shun&#39;Ichi wastes zero time, he rushed up the mountain all the way to a point just short of the peak, he shifts around glncing at the Chuunin once more.
<font color = white>&#34;Still think I&#39;m not up to par yet?!&#34;</font> He goads, though while doing so, he recognizes a fault in his prowess: <i>Reserve.</i>

Immediately the boy scrambles his hands onto the wall, realizing how much strain he&#39;s just placed on his body with that simple feat. He&#39;s in a huff, relying on his own desperation and the Kaguya duo&#39;s willingness to hang on to remain.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Aa--Aaughh, these rocks are a little scrape-ish!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: But I'm fine!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) assumed Chakra was common knowledge and not just horded clan knowledge, taught to their offspring. He was probably  wrong but he had no time to explain before pulling with all his might.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled, trying to work in sync with the other four members of his moving squad. They had done the hard work getting up there manually and now some ingenuity would help with the others.

He groaned as Hanako let them reel her up without her own help. He was expecting the people to climb up as well, but with two lines it should have been possible.</font></font></font>
