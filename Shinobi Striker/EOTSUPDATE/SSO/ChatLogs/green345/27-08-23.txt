If so, then she should be able to realize her precious weapon is about to be swiped away from her at any given moment! Shun&#39;Ichi hesitates, turning over toward his sister once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, that girl&#39;s a Shininijobi or whatever, right?&#34;</font> He aims to clarify, since Sakuya&#39;s been outside longer than he has, perhaps she was present whenever Komo demonstrated some sense of skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: Never needed one? You're tha strong?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t seem to care about the formal attire of his cousin, not even their young age. It should be pretty standard for Uchiha&#39;s to have some geniuses every now and then, and he was curious as to what Kohaku was capable of.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh trust me, I spotted quite a few promising... if not interesting, people already.&#34;</font> If both Kohaku and Batsu followed his gaze, they would see him glancing at Might, Try and then at both Hajime and Shishorama talking near the police officer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) eyes did not change from his normal blank, bored expression. Was this some kind of prank? His cold black eyes merely looked at Try, unblinking.

<font color = white>&#34;Support? Uh...Are you feeling okay?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: OH YEAH!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: ou're not that strong are you?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Never better Raihara. Why?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Yes, legends of the village would say I have a hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Cuz today starts our shinobi adventure! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) delicately shakes his hand with the appropriate amount of strength. She took great care not to actually harm her future comrades and classmates. It was her duty to protect those weaker than her, and she&#39;d uphold that belief until the bitter end.

<font color = white>&#34;When I win, I&#39;ll treat you to some food after.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: No reason...Nevermind it.
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: It looks like it.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: We should meet some of the other students.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) Kohaku didn&#39;t look much younger than Batsu, wondering just what he meant by feeling out of place. It felt natural for the Uchiha himself to finally become apart of the academy after the years of waiting. He&#39;d nod toward his clan member though, a head nod that usually gestures a greeting.

The statement about passing though the academy would resonate with him though, he&#39;d already expected the academy to be something he could easily maintain as his parents had made him study for as long as he could remember.

<font color = white>&#34;Pleasure to meet you Kohaku and yes... We will indeed exceed in this years academy.&#34;</font> he said, smirking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: But there are so many.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) asks: Do you want to have a hard ass head too? Or you just wanting to give it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) clicked her tongue, and idly produced a book from within her garment. Adding a pen to the mix, she began to scribble down on a seemingly blank page. Mysteries upon mysteries were written, surely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Well, I can introduce you to a few.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Hummm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) scoffed at the declaration that he&#39;d beat herself and the other one. So, she did what anyone else in her position would. Push his buttons even harder.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... I&#39;ll just verbally agree to beat you then, I wouldn&#39;t want to touch your hand...&#34;</font> Her nose upturns just a tad, as though she would have caught something being too close to him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) stepped up to Kohaku and put his fists on his hips as he stared intently at the Uchiha trio just... breathing... waiting.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Already making friends?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (dont mind my fists on your hips)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stands behind Try, his cold eyes just examining the three students before him. He would not make any introductions.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) reachs out and touches Shun&#39;Ichi green hair without permission. <font color = white>&#34;Is this natural?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) covers her mouth... She forgot she was with children.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) had no idea that he had been held back on.

He simply figured that despite being part of the Senju, she was a girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;No way. I don&#39;t accept hand outs.&#34;</font> 

Despite Hinoue&#39;s clear reluctance, he steps forth and raises a fist towards her, to seek a fist bump. Defiant eyes lock onto her own. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ...And I'd never lose to you, Shishorama..!
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) asks: ....... Don't worry about that! Answer my question, is that sword girl a ninshija?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Might, Try(The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) OOCs: (Does this game function like most nrp)

<font color = white>&#34;You... can simply say hello, Try.&#34;</font> He was very much as interesting as his cousin stated him to be, how refreshing and out of the box. A chuckle escaped him, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Uchiha, Kohaku... How are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) had found themselves engrossed, reading over the orphan&#39;s shoulder. Who would&#39;ve thought a novel like this could be so attention grabbing?! She wanted to see if the hero would successfully save the kidnapped heroine!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m done with that page. Turn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yells: Ah--- She got away!

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You should really try to be a little cooler, Try.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Positivity is good for the morale of others, so that's a good thing.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) cocks her head toward Kohaku as she hears her name being mentioned. "You wanted to talk?!'</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) spared a glance over toward Komo. Upon realizing that the older woman was insistent on tomorrow&#39;s start date, she clicks her tongue. Stepping further down the path, she turns her attention out toward the gathering.

<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

     The main character's training montage would continue, but would they be successful?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Her statement seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as the optimistic one rapidly approached with a fist held out, intent on connecting some type of gesture that was evidently foreign to her with the confusion crawling across her visage. So, what could she do except from taking an offensive stance?!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to fight me right now?&#34;</font>

Legs set further apart, bending ever so slightly at the knees as all digits furl upon both hands - only for the index and middle to extend in an untrained stance. Unique to her lineage.</font></font></font>

Far from impressed with her polished combat stance that had been handed down across generations, he seems shocked, apalled even. He leans back a tad, as if now -he- were the one who could catch something from her.

He turns to face Kyoko on that note, and takes a step away from the Hyuuga, turning his back towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll play.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, milk-eyes, what&#39;s the game like?&#34;</font> He initiated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I doubt it's gambling. She's an officer of the law!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) feels a twinge in her heart, forced to recoil at the girl&#39;s statement. Somehow, she made it sound a lot worse than it actually was..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, this was a fine day- Though they weren&#39;t nobles he&#39;d hope for the two to fair well in the academy, it&#39;s not that he looked down on them. It was simply instilled at a young age he was to protect them, simply because the nobles were born with strong traits and nothing more. Mental conditioning was strong in this one, though he wasn&#39;t ruled by it.

<font color = white>&#34;I do, too... Just don&#39;t push yourselves too much, hard work is fine until you pull a muscle. It happens to everyone eventually.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

A pause, as she drags her foot along the dirt to make a makeshift line.
<font color = white>&#34;- this spot here, wins. Ah- and if you give an incorrect answer, whether you&#39;re first or not, you have to step backwards. The winner will receive.. ryo! Any questions?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Interesting...

After all, given the circumstances, he figured most folks around were probably younger than him. It was a tough pill to swallow, being on the older side yet perched on such a low position of the shinobi ladder.

Still, he managed to conjure up a sheepish grin in return, refusing to let rudeness take over. <font color = white>&#34;Kaoru.&#34;</font> He replied, giving a brief introduction..</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) attempts to take a step forth, as he was the first one who answered a question. </font></font></font>

  She pulled out an attachment, a small spade like object that she wiggled into place on the top of her staff. The tool now resembles a hoe.

<font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Konoha&#39;s academy course. Ya&#39;ll be training to be shinobi that defends the lands of Fire, we shinobi are the heartline of this nation - Just like farmers.&#34;</font>

 Komo tosses her hoe hard towards the dirt behind the students, piercing and parting the dirt with force.

<font color = white>&#34;Instead of feeding mouths, we shinobi solves and prevent those farmer&#39;s problems from interrupting them making harvest.&#34;</font>

A hand extended facing the handed tool, as it suddenly came back to her grasp. <font color = white>&#34;To do that, we practice and master the use of all life force Chakra. Before we git to all that...&#34;</font>

The woman places the hoe back to her rear, facing the memorial.

<font color = white>&#34;This memorial is what we call tribute, tribute to all the shinobi that has succeeded their limits for their nation, some giving up their lives for you to even breathe and be born. The Will of Fire. If you disrespect this, you&#39;re disrespecting your births. Ya&#39;ll remember that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

His focus then shifted to the Tribute memorial... and he became a little more serious, even though the situation between Shishorama and the other Hyuuga was anything but that in his eyes.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Nope, you can&#39;t hold him.&#34;</font> He told Shishorama. <font color = white>&#34;I caught him, try next week.&#34;</font> She should know by now she was not stronger than him, even if she tried to get the dog from his grasp, his arms simply wouldn&#39;t budge.

<font color = white>&#34;Now... Kohaku, any clue where we take this thing. I can get the bounty and treat all of us for some pork buns.&#34;</font> He nodded at Kumirama, he would get her those pork buns she seemed to want.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) continues to wave at the dog, he was just happy to be there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) rubbed the side of his cheek as he watched Shishorama be herself, acting before thinking in the situation. At least this one did&#39;t seem to endanger anyone, just a puppy with a lack of survival instincts. As for  where to take the dog really?

He&#39;d shrug, <font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know- The lady&#39;s house probably, at least that&#39;s what common sense dictate but i don&#39;t know where she even lives.&#34;</font> The younger Uchiha admitted, he was actually looking around through the town to get a read of the other areas outside the Uchiha Compound.

He&#39;s at least foud everything of importance.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Miss K Dog (A strange dog-) fell asleep, snoring every once in a while.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) already felt regret at the thought of returning this dog... but he can't keep it... he can't.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So cute..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) would take a few steps nearer, squinting at the dog as she inspects it for visible signs of rabies or something. She heard every animal you see running around has that, and it&#39;s not pleasant.

<font color = white>&#34;Then it looks like you have a new pet for now.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tried and tried to get Yuuto budge. He was stronger, sure, but he wasn&#39;t so much stronger that she couldn&#39;t budge him at all. She only two letter grades away!  <font color = white>&#34;Come on! Let me hold him!&#34;</font> She complains loudly.

If something didn&#39;t give, physical violence might be the only option.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) skips her way down the bridge&#39;s guard rail, using it as a gymnast would a balance-beam. 
<font color = white>&#34;Hmm, hum, ha-hum, hm, hm-- hm??&#34;</font> 

She noticed a collective of dog admirers beyond the end. And-- <font color = white>&#34;Hey! You guys found the always-runs-away pooch! Cool beans.&#34;</font> A hop sends her back to solid ground. She posts up in the general vicinity, deciding it best to keep her distance. Animals hated being crowded. Right? Right. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: You're gonna break the dog...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm not!
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) asks: Can..I pet him...?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It didn't even try to run away.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Just let him take a swim. He'll be fine after.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: You should bathe it.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I don't think it would stop you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) That was true, but damn was she stubborn! <font color = white>&#34;You know I would&#39;ve actually let you hold the dog if you simply asked nicely, right?&#34;</font> He just squinted at the girl as his arms actually began to budge.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s sleeping right now, when he wakes up, I&#39;ll let you, now stop yelling, Shishorama.&#34;</font> Now he had to treat her like she was a younger kid. <font color = white>&#34;You can hold him before we find the old lady or when he wakes up, until then,, calm down.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;And yeah, Hanako, wanna help us go look for the owner?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) shuffles his feet toward the sleeping dog, intent on petting it's fluffy head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) immediately relents and allows her arms to flop lifelessely at her side. <font color = white>&#34;Can I please hold him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: So soft..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Is Senju, Kumirama among you guys?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: That's my sister!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Kumirama, Komo-sense is calling for you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was alive to witness this historical moment. Shishorama actually relented. She gave up on something, he had convinced her to step down. <font color = white>&#34;See? Was that so hard?&#34;</font> With that said, he gently slid the dog onto her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, Sensei. We found the dog, where do we take him?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I didn't even know you had a sister...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Sure. I'm the forty-first best person in the village at finding dog owners. I'll lend you my skills.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Oh. Give it here, I'll give him back to Miss Korme.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I haven't seen my sister at all.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Alright, Shishorama, hand the dog over to Sensei, then we can go for some pork buns.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hm. My skills say Sensei will handle the rest. Mission accomplished.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Good job, Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I did my best! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah, here's the other half of the academy.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Yes, Batsu?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) was a polite young woman at her core. She had no need to be violent against her friends unless absolutely necessary. To ask and use manners was not beneath her. 

<font color = white>&#34;Nice!&#34;</font> She says as she takes hold of the big fluffy boy. <font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s so fluffy!&#34;</font> She shrieks in excitement before handing the pup to the Sensei. <font color = white>&#34;Here you go, Sensei. Yuuto was able to grab him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Farewell...doggy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i love this dog icon
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (looks a lot like my dog irl)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Were you at the lesson?
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) asks: We had a lesson already?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I had a supervised spar today Sensei! I did you proud!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: You mean the rock climbing?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) had no idea if Komo would actually be proud or not. She just assumed that would be the case.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It wwas mainly a team work exercise.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Well, how did you do?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I was carried up, sadly my strength didn't do much for climbing. I helped pull people up once there with a group.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) picked up the pup with her lazed eyes gazed upon the creature. It seem like she was all to used to this puppy, clearly did not have the same effects of its presence effecting her at all.

The puppy seemed familar with the Chuunin, easily hopping into her hands and climbing on top of her head as if it was one of its hangout places.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, Ko... Time for you to go back home.&#34;</font> She said, digging into her pocket and handing the &#39;bounty&#39;.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I see. Unfortunate but shows true teamwork.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would clear their throat.

<font color = white>&#34;Soooo Yuuta what about those pork buns.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) tossed the money to Yuuto.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, <font color = white>&#34;I hope we deal more with Chakra next lesson, while my Physical Strength isn&#39;t anything too special I can make that up with my chakra control.&#34;</font>

He was more than sure of that.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: We shall see.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: There goes that word again. Chakra...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) nodded at the dog, bidding it goodbye with a final pet. <font color = white>&#34;Yeah, we should go for those pork buns now-&#34;</font> Then he caught the money tossed his way. <font color = white>&#34;My treat! Let&#39;s go?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Kibo, you don't know what chakra is?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...Makes sense for him.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Heeey there, Maya. Who's your friend?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Yup! Let's go!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Oh? No idea.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I think it's more becase we are from a clan, yes... It's an energy Shinobi use for Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, and even enhancing Taijutsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: An unknown friend. I see, I see.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) approaches with pocketed hands...!

He briefly hesitates, but eventually nods a couple of times.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know what it is, no. Am I supposed to?&#34;</font> He questions, while taking steps forth.

He raises a hand to high five Hanako as he walks past.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello, friend..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Where is the weapon shop?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: It can be morhed into a physical shape if you train hard enough, too.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Friend. Make yourself known! Oh-- hi, other friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I've been demoted from friend to other friend, it seems.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006699>Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) plops his bottom onto the wooden bench, kicking his feet along.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hajime of the twenty ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: So it's energy, right? What's it look like?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Ah.. we my introductions missed previously..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) moves along with puppy in head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: How goes your day?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Well...
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: It's going well! I just learned another piece of key knowledge that I need to beat the clans at their own game. This Chakra stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Ha ha! Of course not. I miss nothing. Ever.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It's kind of bright, and blue-ish.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) missed a lot. All the time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) held a hand to her forehead for a moment, with a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Okiku. I was walking around the academy stuff with you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Ohh..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I remember that!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Certainly..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) barely remembers what she had for breakfast this morning.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Ah yes, this is Okiku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wwould make a flame between his hands to demonstrate, <font color = white>&#34;My Chakra takes on the properties of fire like all of the Uchiha- It&#39;s used to use Katon based Ninjutsu.&#34;</font> He stated before putting the flame out, the demonstration was simple but more effective than his explainations of it as a whole.

<font color = white>&#34;It basically runs through all of us, taking different forms based on the individual or in some cases the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hello, Okiku.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Fire...?!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Ah, right. Uchiha are known for fire.
<br><font color=green>*Hase, Sotan (The frail youth-Salemexc) says: Whoa..
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: The same could be said, I know none of your names either.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Burning down buildings and stuff.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Well! It's good to meet you! 
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm Hanako.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Arsonists.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm not a sponge, don't listen to the rumors.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Terrorist.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Kohaku of the Uchiha, pleasure to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: TerroristS, even.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Kibo, Hajime. Good to meet you too.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Mmm... depends of how the flame is weilded.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Are flames not for burning
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ?!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Good to meet you.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Come with me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: They always are.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Fire destroys, and allowws thigs to regrow from the ashes... So it's not only for burning.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Here are some people at least.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: You, Yuuto and I need to start gathering our money together.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: We really do.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I wish to excell amongst our peers in every aspect.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: I assume you mean learning our Right of Passage Jutsu, huh?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Indeed.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I assume the one who become the first to use our Adult version should have the rights to possibly lead our clan.
<br><font color=red>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I wish I had the money- It's a shame not to have any older Uchiha to teach us... Sadly, my parents arecivilians so I lack much outside of raw talent. 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I have some but not enough.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I know Yuuto earned fifty ryo for finding a dog.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Hmmm.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Sadly, i have no fishing rod to help in any otherway... until I can at least graduate.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Lets go get you one.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Sounds good.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: There.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Now I can help fund people.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I should find the mission person... and a fishing spot.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I didn't see any in the village so far.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Batsu(The reserved preteen-Green345) OOCs: ( Cant do missions yet
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (RIP)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Indeed.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I'll search for odd jobs to try to earn ryo where I can.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Goodluck Kohaku.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I don't think make up classes would be needed, if you just got it right the first time.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: ...but there is make up if you do fail then.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) yells: See, I've never had to do any make up classes!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: ... I've not done any classes.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Just don't fail.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Simple.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Komo sensei.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Did you get my registration?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The first class was just a team work exercise...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Senju, Kumirama. Are they here?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) asks: Uh.. Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) falls down onto his knees, laying down on the ground. closing his eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;...This darn academy..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I am Senju.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Uchiha, Batsu.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: It's okay, Lost! You can find your way to success!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) walked up towards the teacher, slipping a ryo in her sash.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t fail.&#34;</font>

A smile given towards the old Shinobi before dropping her voice lower in a whisper, but still audible to all those around if they listened.

<font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s more where that&#39;s from if I pass with straight A grades.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Hanako, how well do you think you'll do?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: See? The first step's already here. Sign up to join the Academy with Sensei--
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Does success equal sleeping..
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I did, I see your name here.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I'm Kaguya...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) looks away. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll do good,&#34;</font> she murmured, lying through her teeth. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I look forward to see you top of the class.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: y-Yeah..

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: If you don't we'll help you pass.... Somehow.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked at the single ryo as she simply threw it into the river.

<font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t no wishing well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) crossed her arms as she turns to walk past Hajime, briefly sticking her tongue out before halting closer to the others, <font color = white>&#34;I think I&#39;ll have a better time watching you open your grades and hide from me afterwards. Because you did worse.&#34;</font> She had to clarify that last part... Obviously.

<font color = white>&#34;My clan only excels and succeeds after all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) leaned back up, staring at the sky before sighing.

<font color = white>&#34;I will get my family back for this...&#34;</font> He mumbled, raising a single fist in the air.,</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Seems they are doing the bonding.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) raised a single eyebrow, slipping into her pouch as she removes a wad of of over three-hundred ryo. In a hushed voice she spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;So, what&#39;s the price then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked over at the blissful youth.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you Kumirama?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I'm rich.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I have no price.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Kumirama is not over here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) squints, and soon clenches a fist..! Her gesture draws a slightly reddened face from the young man, in frustration.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll see about that.&#34;</font>

He turns away from her, and soon forces a smile as he takes steps towards the two girls in the distance.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. I&#39;m Hajime. Nice to meet you both.&#34;</font>

A single fist extends forth, towards them. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Prove you're rich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looks at her fancy clothes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) with a sigh she&#39;d instead remove the largest fish she had recently caught, handing it over towards the instructor before stepping back next to Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do great at school, teacher.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Hm... Acceptable.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: She does look rich.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Hey, hey. Komo-sensei. How'd you get rich?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) glanced left. 
She glanced right.

It looks like the coast was clear. As long as she ignored the twenty eyeballs within the vicinity. Conditions were perfect. She tip-toed her way over to the guard rail. 

<i>Aaaand</i> slowly started to climb over the obstacle. Her eyes were glued to that discarded single ryo bill. She could buy some candy with that. What a waste! To let it flow away on the current!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Hm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) grabs the raw fish that was given to her by the kombu green haired girl. She savagly bite into the raw fish in its mid section, devouring everything until stuffing the rest of the fish into her mouth, tail end last.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) wasn't sure if she should be frightened or impressed by the display.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) bumped a swollen fist against his.

<font color = white>&#34;Kamiya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Working hard is a good start. Finding more doors to make money.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Being born rich helps too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;I am Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font> She turns to the bright boy and extends her hand. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you as well, Hajime.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's your fist swollen?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) watched Hanako go after the ryo, he didn't care- No one else seemed to care, therefore it was fair game for the Platinum Blonde to go fishing for it. Though he stopped staring to wwatch the Headmistress become a savage and potentially poison herself  to mortify Children.

It seemed to be working.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) does not notice the antics of the headmistress, nor the missed opportunity of nabbing 1 ryo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, watching how the women just devoured a raw fish, He thought for a second, Just staring at her before nodding.

<font color = white>&#34;Do all girls eat like?&#34;</font> He questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Not girls, but real women.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Impressive.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) flops over the guard rail, entirely lacking in grace, and sploshed into the river. 

A minute later, she emerged, blowing on the recovered bill, trying and failing to air-dry it. A soggy set of sandal-prints were left in her trail as she made her way back to Position A! Lurking beneath the street light. 

Drenched, but the grin she wore says she's elated by her mission accomplished. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I pulled my finger out.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Entirely.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's bad.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You shouldn't do that.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I think you could win a eating competition.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Then she poked Shishorama with the bone.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't think it is as bad as it seems.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hard core.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Good work, Hanako. Stealth is a virtue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: w-- You saw?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) steps away on that note, shuddering, even.

Was he speaking to some sort of savage?

<font color = white>&#34;G-good luck in the academy..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I mean, uh..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. saw what? I did nothing.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't like his face.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ?!?!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: I see everything, I've been practicing.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I would pass on eating contests.. They are a waste of food.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's kinda rude.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) pulled out a fish of her own as she stared towards it. She&#39;d take a few seconds of simply gazing at the fish before starting to copy the teacher as she devoured it all bar the bone which would be deposited into a nearby trashcan.

However astute eyes would notice that whilst the fish she had taken out was raw, every bite would be charred and mostly cooked as they entired her mouth. The Hyuugas would clearly notice her pumping katon attuned chakra into the fish to flashcook it.

<font color = white>&#34;Now I&#39;m a real woman, like sensei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: I heard that, y'know?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh yeah? Well--
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I was talking to my friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Loudly.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That is the true test of womanhood...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm...a waste. I guess that makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's okay, I don't like you either. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yawns while trotting down the road.
He glances over to Kamiya, standing next to his sister.

<font color = white>&#34;You.&#34;</font> He scowls ot the both of them, though mostly to Kamiya for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: You looked at her weirdly. I didn't appriecate that.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Usually people descale and debone the Sashimi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) giggled at Sakuya&#39;s words. She approached Hajime and drew her nails down her cheeks, drawing blood--

And then, Shun&#39;ichi appeared.

<font color = white>&#34;What?&#34;</font> She spat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: A true women it's it whole I've been told.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f5c4f5>Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) would walk up to where a lot of people were..

<font color = white>&#34;So this is where everyone went!&#34;</font> She would say as she munched on a strawberry mochi!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...............
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I must continue my search for Kumirama.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: She went north I believe but I might be blind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) paused. 

Her limited attention span was drawn to the events taking place nearby. Aversion, repulsion, and every sickened emotion in between creased and wrinkled her face, watching someone eat a fish of all things in such a animalistic manner!

<font color = white>&#34;Gross. Fish are gross! Don&#39;t you know where that thing&#39;s been, Maya?!&#34;</font>
She waved her arms frantically in protest!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares.

His eyes widen upon seeing the illogical behavior of Kamiya, who draws blood with her own nails. 

<font color = white>&#34;Umm... Kamiya, does that not hurt...?&#34;</font> He asks, though the sheer display has him weirded out, incredibly so.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held out a single seal, disappearing.

<font color = white>&#34;I was hunt her like a hunter during mating season.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: What a interesting person.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;.....&#34;</font> Nothing was said, he simply glares, circling her aimlessly before replacing her spot at Sakuya&#39;s side.

<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you hanging around that thing, sis?&#34;</font> He initiates.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) looks to Maya as a fish was withdrawn from somewhere and stared at, <font color = white>&#34;Wait, that&#39;s not good for you--&#34;</font> The Hyuuga grimaced as the Gorumba&#39;s mouth opened to chow down - only to relax all of a sudden and exhale. All tension flows away, like that ryo bill in the river would have if not &#39;saved&#39; by Hanako.

She was puffing flames to cook it at the very last second... Scary, but... Not as poisonous as it could have been. The fish probably had scales and everything though, gross.

<font color = white>&#34;...I think fish isn&#39;t for me anymore.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) removed a napkin from her pouch as she began to delicately dab at her lips in order to clean them of any fishy debris before turning her attention towards Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;This river, I caught it myself...&#34;</font>

A simple answer to a straight forward questio as her head cocked to the side in a curious manner.

<font color = white>&#34;And it&#39;s a fresh as it comes, orphans can&#39;t be picky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: What thing are you talking about?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) swiped her eyes over at Hajime. The cuts aren&#39;t particularly deep, but she bled softly from the rake all the same. It doesn&#39;t take long for it to roll down to her jawline, and then drip to the cobblestone beneath.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course it hurts.&#34;</font> She replied, before moving to face the ugly, green-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m going to hurt you really badly.&#34;</font> She promised to Shun&#39;ichi.</font></font></font>

It was indeed a pin bone that she had swallowed, a sharp end had lodged itself within the base of her esophagus and needed to be dislodged.

However she was too weak to dislodge it herself, causing each weak dull thump to just cause her to choke loudly.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) deciding that, Maya&#39;s life was not being tended to properly, the young Hajime suddenly breaks off into a sprint. This needed to be a precise move to work, or else, it simply would not work.

He had seen it happen before..! 

<font color = white>&#34;No pain, no gain..&#34;</font>

After garnering the necessary momentum, the young orphan jumps onto Maya&#39;s stomach to deliver a drop kick with the force of gravity behind it, performing the most violent heimlich maneuver possible..!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got you..!&#34;</font>

The fact that the Hyuuga was trying to save her had ignited his competitive spirit, and he wished to do so, instead. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Hinoue(The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) OOCs: (that was my saving roll)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) idly starts picking things up.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) apparently misses and falls face first into the ground?!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) swaps to dragging Hajime to the river instead. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: New patient! 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi(The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (My fault, was setting up profile, gimme like one more min)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: W-wait! I'm fine..!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) Alas! A saviour who knew what was wrong, her attempted murder by drowning was adverted for now as the strike PERFECTLY dislodged the bone as it ejected from her mouth with speed, flying through the air in a perfect arc before landing innocently on the ground in front of them.

A gasp of air entered her lungs as she began to violently cough for a few seconds.

<font color = white>&#34;T-Thanks... damn fish bone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Are you sure? You ate pavement really hard!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Like.. your head made a 'thonk' noise.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I thought that only happened in manga! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) has a lump on his head, from it striking the pavement.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, but if you put me in the water, I&#39;ll get wet. My money will get wet. Then, I won&#39;t be able to buy you the stuff I told you I would.&#34;</font> He protests, before he raises both hands up to plead for mercy.

His eyes were spinning, though. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stares at the dark-haired boy intently, silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, he could feel a very aggressive stare coming from her eyes as he raised his hand, rubbing his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Haha...just a joke of course...&#34;</font> He lied.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) released him, if only because he insisted he was fine. 

<font color = white>&#34;Untrue! Shopkeeps don&#39;t mind when the ryo&#39;s a little soggy! They just.. narrow their eyes and stare at you a lot. It&#39;s probably because the sogginess makes the numbers harder to read?&#34;</font> She shrugs! A hand came down, offering to yank him to his feet. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would watch the Senju and Kaguya both strike the bastard child of a Senju, he was doomed. Though, the one being struck was being a jerk. He honestly didn&#39;t care if it didn&#39;t escalate further than it had, and all the while another girl was saved from a fish bone.

<font color = white>&#34;And the day was saved, thanks to the Hyuuga.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) An overbearingly smug grin hooked upon the corners of the Hyuuga&#39;s lips and tugged wider as she witnessed her perfect strike dislodge the fish bone straight from the source. It surprised her a little, but she would never admit that. As far as anyone else knew, this was planned and she was the most skilled academy student.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahaha! You&#39;re welcome. Nothing comes close to my clan&#39;s techniques after all,&#34;</font> she proclaimed, side-eyeing Hajime after he had failed to compete and was now being dragged off to heal underwater. Or attempted to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) The backhand, caught him off-guard! The Senju sibling was definitely quicker than the Kedoiin, which forces him to bite on his tongue fiercely. <font color = white>&#34;Owhhhhh! Sahu--&#34;</font> Followed by Kamiya&#39;s own violent outburst, though, he wouldn&#39;t give the girl the satisfaction of hitting him.

Blocking the girl&#39;s attack, he continues to whine with a damaged tongue, <font color = white>&#34;Buh, Kahiha sarhed i&#39; &#39;he ot&#39;er deh!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) accepts the yank!

He rises to his feet with her aid, a tad wobbly. He threatens to wobble in all four cardinal directions and fall again, due to the previous impact.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow. Can you guys stop spinning, please?..&#34;</font> He requests, before side-eyeing the spinning Hanako as well, with a faint flash of spite.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Hinoue.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Could I speak with you in private?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) relentlessly attacked, delivering another kick. He seemed to think this was some sort of game--

It was not, as the blood poured from her own rakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) noticed Hajime&#39;s unsteadiness.

A swirl that carried him east, north, west, south! Hm! Clearly the remedy for such things was to spin him in the opposite direction, as to unwind the factors that made him dizzy in the first place! So! She grasped him by the shoulders and spun him clockwise, akin to a kid being prepared for their turn at a pinata. 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s okay! I&#39;ll just.. unspin you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I'm a medical professional. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) was not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would grip Shish shirt.

<font color = white>&#34;I can only hold my breath for five seconds.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) arched a brow inquisitively as the veiny protrusions spreading from those fainty lavender orbs would gradually soften and lose their prominence - no longer visible against skin. She wondered what could have prompted this request, but she doubts it was anything bad after witnessing her greatness just now.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... Alright, sure,&#34;</font> she obliged, <font color = white>&#34;Lead the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) hugged her sister tightly, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry for my loss! I love you, Kumi!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Oh no.

<font color = white>&#34;W-wait..! Unspin..? Wah..!&#34;</font>

The unspinning has the opposite effect and he finds himself teetering even more, until he threatens to collapse right onto Hanako..! A hand rises to cover his mouth, as well.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Yeahhhhhhhh, I will gladly drown you.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I have a few questions.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: What are they? If it's for clan secrets, that's... secret.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: No, I don't care to know that.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Why do you think your clan is the most esteemed?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I'm curious.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Well, aren't we? We're respectable, noble, all-seeing. One of us leads the police force too.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Does that make you the most esteemed though?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: I think we are. And that's what I was taught by elders too.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: The Uchiha are heavily known throughout this world, feared for our doujutsu and are considered noble as well. Even the Senju.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: I ain't saying you are wrong, just wanted to see your thought process behind it.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Being feared doesn't equate to being esteemed! We're respected for our talents, not feared.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: The Senju, well... I guess they are pretty close.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Likewise.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Our doujutsu is a talent like the Byakugan.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Can you use it now?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: It's the most superio-
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: It doesn't work like that.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: So you can't control it?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: From my understanding..
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: It awakens when a member of our clan goes through something of high emotion, awakening in time of need.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Ours awakens through the hardwork our clan puts into their training.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: That's why I can already use mine.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: It doesn't mean I work any less than you, the circumstances for awakening are just different.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: We could have a match if you'd like to show you I aint a pushover.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: What, now?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Doesn't matter.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Maybe when your eyes awaken we can, that'd be fun.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Why not now?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: But if you'd rather then, that is fine too.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: We'd both be able to go all out with our clans' famous eyes.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) would nod, it sounded cool in that way. He&#39;d smile and offer a hand to shake, issuing their deal would be made.

<font color = white>&#34;Sounds like a plan.&#34;</font> he stated.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) seemed initially reluctant as she looks down at the hand held out to her. Though, as she thought about it... He may have had something of a point. The Uchiha and Senju clans were just as known as the clan possessing the &#39;all-seeing white eye&#39;. An approximate level of prestige similar to her own, which she felt warranted accepting the handshake after all. Unlike the clanless one, Hajime.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright,&#34;</font> she spoke up, extending a hand to meet the gesture and return it. She hoped she washed his hands, considering the evident thing she had against filth.

There was a pause as what came next was evidence of how she filtered out most people who hadn&#39;t directly earned her attention, rather than overhearing their noise, <font color = white>&#34;...What was your name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Hinoue(The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) OOCs: (she hoped he washed*)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Batsu(The reserved preteen-Green345) OOCs: ( back sorry

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) would retract his hand, raising a brow. He was sure he&#39;d told her yesterday but didn&#39;t mind repeating himself.

<font color = white>&#34;My name is Batsu of the Uchiha clan.&#34;</font> he replied, smille fading away.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) nodded, the name sounded familiar - though she couldn&#39;t recall direct conversation with him until this talk. Either her attention was stretched elsewhere or she had just somehow forgotten the introduction? Nevertheless, after the shake, she would return her hand to her lap - maintaining proper posture.

<font color = white>&#34;Well met,&#34;</font> she spoke, seeding manners that had been trained and reinforced into the young girl&#39;s mind aloud. <font color = white>&#34;It looks like there&#39;s another class soon. I hope it&#39;s not rockclimbing, I luckily missed that class because I was tired. I saved my hands from getting scratched up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Rock climbing sounds.. painful.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: But arriving early is best...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Indeed.

<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: Where is the closest fishing spot?
