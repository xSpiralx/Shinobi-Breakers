<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: No
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hey, Kaido. How're you doin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) flicked the sticky coin he had produced across his fingers once more, taking in the situation quietly with a wandering violet gaze. A dark eyebrow would be raised at the grumpy old merchant.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) nods at Rellin and lets out a huge sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhh I&#39;m doing pretty good you know. Getting better, going to be the greatest in my specialization one day heh. How are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) begins counting his ryo over, becoming increasingly proud of his earnings.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) finally removes his hand from atop her head and stuffs it into his pocket. Sighing as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Then we&#39;re not gonna play two-hundred. Rolling dice just to roll dice isn&#39;t fun...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: yI need to make some money, who's got some?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: *I*
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll give you 100 ryo if you give me 200 ryo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) eyes panned between the collective. Silently observing his soon to be peers as the intereact with one another and form indepenent fractions. At this moment all he required was some form of indication of who was in charge. He wasn't sure if the village had an active chuunin nor Jounin.

But it was probably wise to keep a close eye on every's attire. Maybe there he'd be able to parse out the officials from the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances at the light purple haired girl.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not even pretty enough to talk to, go make me a sandwhich.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirled her hair around her index finger idly while she conversed. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. I think I&#39;ll be the best in mine as well. Make sure you don&#39;t fall behind.&#34;</font> she said with a light chuckle.

<font color = white>&#34;Care to share what your specialization will be, or are you one of the people who like to keep secrets?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll keep it a secret for now!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) raised an eyebrow at the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Why would I do anything for you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Man, secrets are lame. Isn't she supposed to be your wife or whatever too? That's gonna be a tough marriage...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances back at the girl.

<font color = white>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t you? You&#39;ve got two hands and I forgot to do the dishes at home. Chop chop!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll tell you in private later Rellin!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Eh, pay me 100 ryo and I'll do it.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Happy wife happy life.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I was just saying that before, you're not pretty enough to pay.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: You should be happy I'm even talking to you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Really? I think she's pretty pretty.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Then marry her.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, I gotta get rich and famous first. Maybe later.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How are you going to get famous?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Throwing mountains at people.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) gave a thumbs up at Hideo before looking at the other boy before.

<font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re not gonna pay me, I won&#39;t do anything for you, simple as.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) quickly returns the thumbs up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Darn, I coulda had a maid..
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) asks: ...Anyone even got cash 'sides what we earned from the race?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Why would you want an ugly maid? Get your priorities straight before you get cash.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I'll through you at people.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shaked her head.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She totally did...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Yeah. Is that supposed to be a good amount?

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrm.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: How far away am I from a sword? That's all I care about.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Kinda want to play again
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: For double the money
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I missed the games.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I 'unno, swords are pretty expensive I think.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: 'Bout, like, two-thousand-somethin'.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Fuck. Well, I'll get there one day.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Fer a small one.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Shit man, fuck.

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I just had the strong urge to rob someone.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: But that would be wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Very wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah man robbing people is messed up.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Unless it's like, part of a mission. Then it's pretty cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) perks up from the scroll he was lazily perusing through.
  <font color = white>&#34;What a thing to say.&#34;</font> He became even less engaged in the writings.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: MM that reminds me... I meant to go shopping earlier.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) flicked the synthetic golden coin behind him. The sticky object thudded into the dust at the base of a nearby tree. He cracked all thirty knuckles, stretched for a moment, and took his leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Sounded like someone was crunching on dry ramen just now.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Damn, now I'm hungry...

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wish he'd train with us some more.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Sorry anyone want to play 200?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: For fun?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I think my luck needs recharging for a few years.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) reached into one of her pouches, and withdrew... A protein bar? The unhealthy honey, and chocolate-brand.

<font color = white>&#34;Dice &#39;n me don&#39; get &#39;long.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
