<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) he lifted one hand in a greeting at the newly arrived person. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Kfh, no, I'm kidding. I'm going to head back home and get some actual sleep. 
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I understand..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) picked himself up from the ground with a grumble, stretching his arms for a few moments before lumbering over towards the wall to his west.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) leans his head over ever so slightly in that of a nod.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: He must be -really- tired, huh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) took a few more moments to size the fellow student up, then nodded and turned back to the centre of the gathering place.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I suppose so. He was quite tired when he arrived. I suppose he really needs a long nap, then. Which is fine, no classes have begun yet - today at least. As far as I am aware.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Hm? Oh, hey there.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) looks from side to side. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: ... 'Kay then.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Since there aren't much of any teacher awake or around, should we try to train, like, spar or something?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: ...Oh that's where everyone is.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Hello.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: And I suppose we could spar, if any of you are interested. Could even make a sort of 'team spar' to see how well we work together. But, do not feel forced to, of course.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) turns his head back to look at the finely dressed kid, then put up a hand as a greeting.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) muttered something beneath his breath and began advancing forward towards the crowd. Maintaining his silence he'd hope to melt into the group seamlessly as they continued their discussion. However it seemed as though there was about to be a spar between two of the children. 

Closing his distance tween him and the others, the child began assessing the two. Maybe they were the top boys of Amegakure, or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) folds his arms and watches the bout from afar.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets again.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m fine with a spar or anything, really. Team or not. But yeah, I do wish the teachers would wake up and such, heh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm up for it. Would be nice to know what and who I'm working with in the future.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) looked towards the Yuki and the green-haired person before chuckling, covering her mouth as she did.
<font color = white>&#34;Three of us, then... Well, I suppose you two could spar, if you&#39;d like, and I&#39;ll just watch? That is, unless someone would like to join in?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Sure, I'll be up for that. You, Kusahara?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: Yeah, sounds good.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) asks: Well, shal we do it here, or wanna go elsewhere? You got an idea, Hana?
<br><font color=green>*Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) says: I'm fine either way, but we don't want to go too far, in case the teacher arrives.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: When I sparred earlier, we went west a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) says: Lead the way, then.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Follow me, hahaha. -- Anyone wanting to watch, feel free to watch along, as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) stretches his arms then follows briskly after the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) smirks as he watces the other student get closer as well.
His own movement slowing down just a bit, only to get closer still.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) slowly advances, his fists in front of his body to deliver quick jabs once he is near enough. Once Yuki is close enough, Kushara would charge, upper body leant forward, ready to deliver quick upward strikes at the jaw of his opponent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) watches the two of them closely, seeing as their speed wasn&#39;t much different than her own speed, the two must have other capabilities that improve them.
Her eyes squint as Subaru would slow down a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what he&#39;s planning...&#34;</font> She&#39;d whisper softly, only to watch Kusahara next.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) draws near, mild curiosity along his visage. As the sparring match of sorts commenses he'd allow his eyes to traces both of the trainers movements.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) didn&#39;t let his smirk fade. Not even in the slightest, as he would weave himself past the uppercut-attempt coming from Kusahara, before aiming a jab of his own at the taller&#39;s stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;Nice try!&#34;</font>

[Agility: E+]
[Dodged: 1/4 ]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) snarls and catches Yuki's fist, using the momentum of his strike to pull him closer, ready to deliver an elbow strike at the back of his head.

[Dodged: 1/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) kept his smirk up even when his own strike did not land.
Nimble movements, at least, for their comparitive levels, would allow him to move around his sparring partner, aiming to reach his side, dodging the attack once more before aiming a strike at their hip.

[Dodged: 2/4]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) gasped swiftly at the incoming strike, taking a step back to reposition himself away from the attack and gather his strength.

[Dodged 2/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) didn&#39;t hold back, he&#39;d rush forward, ready to strike again.
His feet would slide over the dirt below, before his elbow would aim its way towards Kusahara&#39;s chest.

<font color = white>&#34;Heh, trying to get away, are we?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) focused his gaze and waited for the Yuki to get closer, before taking a risky gamble, sidestepping just before the attack landed, hoping to deliver a punch to the cheeks and knocking his opponent on the ground.

[Dodged 3/3] </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Subaru (The long-haired boy-Aetherose) would move away just in time, moving his left arm to intercept the upcoming blow, moving it out of the way before his own fist would aim at the center of the other&#39;s stomach.

<font color = white>&#34;Not bad! But I&#39;m not going to take any of your hits if I can prevent them!&#34;</font>

[Dodged again]
[Strength E]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) could not move fast enough to avoid the confident fist stabbing into his stomach! It had enough force to knock the air out of him, and leaving him crumbled on the ground, gasping and coughing.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah.... okay... you win!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Ah, that one.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Who will be giving the speech?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) looks over to the dancer and raised a brow.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (sorry, nearly done with this code.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) entered the bustling courtyard of the Ninja Academy of Amegakure, his tall figure draped in a dark cloak that contrasted sharply with the vibrant uniforms of the students. His demeanor exuded a controlled aggression, evident in the furrowed brows and the smug curl of his lips. Beside him walked Kryu, another figure clad in standard shinobi attire, blending into the background of the bustling academy scene.

As they moved among the academy students engaged in training, Sogeki's piercing gaze swept over them in a swift, calculated manner. Each glance was brief yet impactful, leaving an unmistakable impression of authority and power. Kryu, a mere silhouette beside Sogeki, mirrored his intensity with a quiet determination, contributing to the palpable tension in the air.

The students, accustomed to rigorous training and the presence of senior instructors, couldn't help but feel the weight of Sogeki and Kryu's presence. Some straightened instinctively under their scrutiny, while others exchanged nervous looks. Their silent observation seemed to cast a shadow over the courtyard, a reminder of the harsh realities of ninja life.

Amidst the training exercises and the senior instructor's commands, Sogeki and the shadowy figure of Kryu remained a focal point, their quiet yet formidable presence leaving an indelible mark on the young aspiring shinobi of Amegakure. Together, they embodied a potent combination of controlled aggression and disciplined resolve, setting a standard that few dared to challenge.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) smirked.

<font color = white>&#34;Got it.&#34;</font>
His finger finally landing a grappled connection with the booger. Then retreating from his nostril and removing it from the deep corner it was lodged in.

Flicking it off his finger in the direction of the two behind him without knowing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: Was bigger than I thought.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked; she didn&#39;t move nor did she react in any method. The young one was more then capable of raising his brow as he stared, and slowly her hands eased back behind her back. 

A softly tsk formed from her lips; the young looking yer older dark-skinned young woman appeared out of place. Her attire an oddity, and yet she adorned a massive assortment of weapons upon her frame. 

The most outstandish being a rather hefty looking ornate looking blade attached to her hip. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm...,&#34;</font>

Her eyes shifted, and she peered forth upon those around her - she held back for now on how she wished to speak. She was a vice, a woman of cold, and blunt nature yet she carried herself with the mannerisms of experience and aggressive training. 

A twist of her frame, agile, and daft while she turned to stare at everyone with a mere spin before she finally took a step forward, and shifted her back away from those within the area. 

She simply stared. She wanted to know who was speaking, so that she may hopefully avoid having to deal with such things. She hated long talks, and honestly hated most people. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I would advise against such outlandish and potentially harmful aspects.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Should one find reasons, many of which find reasons for no purpose they might just end up attacking you for flicking that about.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It would ruin my fun if you got hurt over such childish reasons.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) observes the interaction silently.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) After a minute or so of silent observation, Sogeki realized that this courtyard wasn&#39;t the one designated for the combat trials. Annoyance etched deeper lines onto his visage, furrowing his brows and tightening his lips into a displeased frown. His icy gaze swept across the surroundings with a hint of frustration, silently criticizing himself for the oversight.

The revelation disrupted the atmosphere of controlled tension he had cultivated, causing a momentary ripple of confusion among the academy students who had felt his intimidating presence. Finally breaking his silence, Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd.

<font color = white>&#34;Where&#39;s the fight happening?&#34;</font> His tone was clipped and assertive, demanding immediate clarity amidst the unexpected setback. The question hung in the air, drawing all eyes to him briefly before a senior instructor stepped forward to redirect everyone to the correct location.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) extends his left pinky out and then raises it. Moving it right to his ear and then beginning to dig inside of it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: Ah nice nice. Nothing beats digging out built up wax.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#74865b>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) drifts his gaze the crowd. As the various people he'd likely come to know as peers conversed and interacted there's a certain voice that cuts through the chatter. Sliding his gaze long the faceless mass it eventually falls on Sogeki.

The remnants of his question linger in the air for a moment and in response he simply blinks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) noticed the grandson of a revered hero actively ignoring him, which sparked a wave of frustration within him. How dare anyone dismiss him in such a manner? His annoyance turned to indignation as he locked his gaze on the white-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, you better clean out those crusted ears! I know you heard me, nerd!&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice carried across the courtyard, sharp with irritation. His words were a challenge, laced with authority and demanding respect. <font color = white>&#34;Where&#39;s the fight happening!?&#34;</font> He emphasized each word, his tone leaving no room for disobedience or evasion.

The students nearby glanced nervously between Sogeki and the white-haired boy, sensing the tension crackling in the air. The grandson of the hero hesitated for a moment, visibly caught off guard by Sogeki&#39;s direct approach. Before he could respond, a senior instructor intervened swiftly, redirecting attention to the correct location of the combat trials.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm, maybe all of you won't die after all.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: But, I'm going for a walk around the village - if you end up in a fight don't cause any damage to the village or I'll personally drown you in the lake.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s frustration simmered as he redirected his focus to the dark-skinned dancer, recognizing her as the only person who seemed truly present among the indifferent crowd. In his eyes, the others were mere zombies or filler, lacking the vitality he sought.

<font color = white>&#34;We can fight as long as no damages? Hmm.&#34;</font> Sogeki smirked, his tone challenging and provocative. <font color = white>&#34;No promises!&#34;</font>

He stepped forward with purpose, intending to intercept her departure and assert his presence, though not necessarily dominance.

<font color = white>&#34;G&#39;day,&#34;</font> he greeted, the aggression in his voice tempered with a hint of restraint. It was clear Sogeki possessed some degree of manners, even in his confrontational approach. His demeanor conveyed authority, yet there was a nuanced respect in his interaction with her, acknowledging her as a potential challenger rather than dismissing her outright.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Seems more people are here, right now... Odd, I thought the Monument-area would have been a more crowded area.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked, she had begun walking away to begin her joyous and rather calming walk amongst the village she lived within. A softly jingle of coin could be noted, a section of coins locked upon silk-threads were placed at her hip. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? Good day,&#34;</font>

She replied in a rather simple, blunt and cold method. Her head slowly turned to face him, and those hands fastened behind her back promptly. 

   <font color = white>&#34;All damages inflicted to the village will be inflicted to you,&#34;</font>

She reaffirmed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) takes his pinky out of his ear and wipes the wax off the tip of it on the wall nearby.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Welp.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (Welp*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s gaze narrowed slightly as he observed the dark-skinned dancer&#39;s demeanor, noting the jingle of coins at her hip and the poised stance she held. Her blunt and cold reply didn&#39;t faze him; if anything, it piqued his interest further.

<font color = white>&#34;All damages inflicted to the village will be inflicted to you,&#34;</font> she asserted firmly.

Sogeki&#39;s smirk deepened as he unfolded his arms and casually scanned her attire, assessing her as a shinobi based on what he could discern. Her silk-threaded coins hinted at a blend of agility and resourcefulness, likely indicating proficiency in movement-based techniques.

With a nonchalant shrug, Sogeki met her gaze evenly. <font color = white>&#34;How about this,&#34;</font> he began, his tone carrying a hint of challenge. <font color = white>&#34;You become my direct mentor. I&#39;m sure you have plenty to teach me.&#34;</font> His demand was bold and direct, reflecting his confidence and disregard for the consequences she warned of.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) walks to the group of civilians while sipping on her iced coffee.A loud slurping noise can be heard as the girl reached the bottom of her drink.

<font color = white>&#34;That was good,I can finally start my day.&#34;</font>she said while shaking her bottle causing the ice to bang on the inside of the bottle<font color = white>&#34;So how is everyone today?I hope all is good or are we just standing here waiting for something to happen?&#34;</font>

The girl seemed a bit snarky as if she was some type of mean girl or something.Her eyes would size everyone up and down before casting judgment on their fit.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh hello,how&#39;s it going miss?&#34;</font>she said while waving at the darkskin lady<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re never hard to find.....if we were in a book you&#39;d be considered a main character based off how you stick out.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) blinked. Her attention drawn for the moment, and slowly she smirked. 

   <font color = white>&#34;My mentorship requires one to earn it,&#34;</font>

She slowly moved towards this young man, the one that held the mettle of being the Grandson of a Hero. Those subtle steps were nearly silent, each step slow, and focused - if he didn&#39;t flee?

He would only know truly understand what she had planned to do. A hand extended, and if she wasn&#39;t stopped? She would rather easily motion to fling that man up and into the air. 

A rather jolting motion, and the direct was towards the nearby lake. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? A main character? I suppose my attire is noticable,&#34;</font>

She moved to return to her spot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would nod her head even though she was more so talking about her skin color compared to all the pale skinned people around her who seemed to hate the sun rays</font></font></font>

He hadn't taken him for the type to ask for mentorship. In what he'd briefly seen of him he seemed closer to a brute of some kind. His head slowly tilts to the side as his eyes trail along the woman's movements.

In one swift motion she watches the woman attempt to throw them into the waters and in this he looks toward the newcomer on his right.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) didn&#39;t notice anyone walking up to him. He was chilling and minding his own business. Suddenly his head rocketed back and <font color = white>&#34;ACHOO!&#34;</font> he sneezed.

Blinking a few times he noticed he was mid air. Spiraling about like a ball thrown in the air. Not a single clue as to how he even got up here. <font color = white>&#34;Sheesh. Must of been a strong sneeze-&#34;</font> and then he splashed right in to the river. Nothing happened after that. Just bubbles surfacing to the top.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Wait wait wait... What...?&#34;</font>

He would raise his hands up and push away anything she would try to offer him.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you think I&#39;m a begger...?&#34;</font>

He looked himself over for a minute, he looked fine as far as he saw, his hair was just a bit messy, not dirty.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) watched as the boy, who had been flung towards the water, sneezed, only for him to land inside said lake, and not rising up again.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhm... This doesn&#39;t look good...?&#34;</font> She&#39;d say, not quite loud, but not in a hushed tone either, before rushing towards the water, herself, jumping in, in order to try and help the boy out of it, or at least get him to not stay underwater.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would tilt her head as she questioned alot.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s focus remained unwavering amidst the chaos that often swirled around him. While his classmates indulged in various extracurricular activities, he remained singularly dedicated to forging a path towards a stronger future. The petty distractions of others held no sway over his ambitions or principles.

His determination to establish a solid foundation for himself was palpable, driving him to hone his skills relentlessly. Whether in combat training or mastering advanced techniques, Sogeki pushed himself with unwavering discipline. The fleeting pursuits and diversions of his peers were inconsequential in his pursuit of mastery and excellence.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me,&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice cut through the ambient noise, his tone laced with arrogance and confidence as he turned to the dark-skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;How does one earn the honor of becoming your first and most important pupil?&#34;</font> His gaze locked onto hers, challenging and expectant, as if daring her to recognize his potential and skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) rubs the nape of his neck and looks off over to the comotion to his left. His posture was one of faint exhuasion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Raku(The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) OOCs: [exhaustion*]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) would narrow his eyes at her once again, getting more and more confused by the second.

<font color = white>&#34;N-no... It&#39;s just my hairstyle and I like it... I don&#39;t need a haircut.&#34;</font>

He&#39;d proceed to raise his hands up to cover his head and protect his hair from the girl.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Mugen, Yurei (The long-haired boy-Mirageman) kept his hands to his side and then looked over with a light smile to those of his right. His long tied hair swayed in the soft undiffused evening breeze.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: There is nothing honorable about becoming someone's pupil, lowborn.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) had returned to her place, and stood there once more with her hands nestled behind her back. A poised stance, one of experience past her years, and it honestly showed. 

She didn&#39;t even make notice of the young lad drowning - he would learn to swim, or he would sink. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Hm? My methods are harsh, brutal, and often end the lives of those wishing to learn to become like me if they survive? Often more then not they are crippled. Train, and show me that you can survive - then we can see,&#34;</font>

She answered simply.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) When the soft spoken lass leaped in to the water, they&#39;d see the white-haired boy with his legs and arms crossed relaxing in the water. As if taking a break before decided to resurface.

A wave given and then <font color = white>&#34;..hllphb.&#34;</font> he&#39;d say as air bubbles escaped his mouth when speaking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do not baby Genin, I am not here to coddle you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) 
As Daigen left the tranquil training area and walked towards the busier parts of Amegakure, he soon found himself in a crowded marketplace. The vibrant energy of the village was palpable, with merchants calling out their wares, villagers chatting animatedly, and children running about. The contrast to the solitude of his training ground was stark, but Daigen moved through the crowd with ease, his senses alert and focused.

His attention was drawn to a dark-skinned woman standing in the center of the bustling crowd. She had an air of confidence and charisma that seemed to captivate those around her. The crowd’s attention was firmly fixed on her, and she spoke with a commanding presence that demanded respect.

Daigen didn't approach her directly. Instead, he found a spot nearby where he could observe without drawing too much attention to himself. Leaning against a wall, he watched as the woman engaged with the people around her. She spoke passionately about something, her gestures animated and expressive. 

He tried to discern what she was saying from a distance. Her voice, though clear, was drowned out by the general noise of the market. However, her body language and the reactions of the crowd spoke volumes. She appeared to be a figure of some importance or influence, and the villagers seemed to hang on her every word.

Daigen’s eyes narrowed slightly as he observed. He noted the way she commanded the space around her, the way people leaned in to listen, the respect evident in their expressions. There was something about her that intrigued him, though he couldn’t quite put his finger on it. 

His thoughts wandered as he considered the possibilities. Who was this woman? What role did she play in the village? Was she a shinobi, a leader, or perhaps someone with a different kind of influence? 

For now, Daigen chose to remain an observer. He knew that understanding the people around him, especially those who commanded such attention, could be crucial. He continued to watch, taking in every detail, from her expressions to her interactions with the crowd.

Though he didn’t make a move to approach her, Daigen stored away this moment in his mind. One day, it might prove useful to know more about the influential figures within his village. For now, he would remain in the background, learning what he could from the shadows.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) begins to laugh a bit<font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t know people went outside like that on purpose......are you like rebeling against your family or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) shook his head silently as he turned toward the ongoing conversation between who he'd assumed to be the instructor and his peers.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Then again.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) blinked again slolwy, at this point he was beginning to get self conscious about his hair, was it really that bad?

<font color = white>&#34;No... I love my family. What&#39;s wrong with my hair? I think it looks cool, I go out every day looking like this.&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t know how to deal with this, he had never experienced this sort of interaction before.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I do believe I have to teach some method of fundamental Taijutsu and Kenjutsu.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Haji(The black-haired boy-Wizio) OOCs: (chatgpt going brazy)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) folds their arms, casting a disgusted gaze towards a particular exchange between chuunin and genin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) gave the white-haired boy a dumbfounded look, before pouting as she&#39;d fold her arms.
The boy was likely a Hozuki, Shinobi of Water.
<font color = white>&#34;Well crud...&#34;</font> She&#39;d think, seeing how her help wasn&#39;t even neccessary.

Then, the realization set in further, and she couldn&#39;t help but smile at the boy, waving back at him before pointing up, as she decides it was best to leave the boy in his &#39;area of expertise&#39;, and to have some fresh air, herself, climbing out of the water, soaking wet, afterwards.</font></font></font>

Her interactions with the crowd were boisterous to say the least; her authority was telling and people responded with respect and attentiveness towards her. He noticed the way she spoke and took notes, understanding her building a strong rapport with each individual.
The boy picked up on a few key details, noticing how the woman often spoke about improvements and benefits for the village. It became cleaer that she was a local leader.
Satisfied with the information he had gathered, Daigen leaned back against a railing and took a deep breath while analyzing and channeling the information he had received. This would be crucial for him to build connections with influential figures in the future as he continued his endeavors as a shinobi of Amegakure. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I haven't, personally, seen her before. At least, I'm not quite sure. To me though she may seem like an entertainer of sorts - However, she did fling a person into the water. This likely would mean she's either a higher-ranked Shinobi - Or kunoichi, or she's just very strong as well as, well, you get the point, probably...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s gaze sharpened with a flicker of anger that simmered beneath his confident exterior, fueling his desire to surpass not only others but himself as well. The dark-skinned dancer&#39;s blunt assessment of her training methods, harsh and unforgiving, resonated with him on a primal level.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm,&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted, his voice edged with the simmering anger that churned within him. He acknowledged the truth in her words, knowing that talent alone would not suffice in the brutal world of shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;Harsh, brutal, and often crippling,&#34;</font> he repeated, his tone now laced with a fierce determination rather than excitement. <font color = white>&#34;I understand.&#34;</font>

His eyes bore into hers with a steely resolve. <font color = white>&#34;I have talent, but I know I must work harder than anyone else to get ahead and stay ahead,&#34;</font> he declared firmly. The acknowledgment of his own potential was coupled with a relentless drive to prove himself worthy of her instruction, to push beyond his limits and emerge stronger, regardless of the challenges ahead.

<font color = white>&#34;I accept your terms,&#34;</font> Sogeki affirmed, his voice ringing with the conviction born of both anger and ambition. <font color = white>&#34;Train me. I&#39;ll show you what I&#39;m capable of.&#34;</font> His declaration hung in the air, a silent vow to himself and a challenge to the dancer who had dared him to prove himself worthy. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) asks: And... Seeing as someone practically begs her to train them, she's likely Chuunin or higher?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) continued to stand her ground; her hands never unfurling or leaving her back while she listened. She sighed briefly, and slowly motioned to ease a hand from the curling behind her back. 

She rubbed her chin slowly; her skin untouched - almost flawless in nature despite her information regarding her training regiment. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Earn it, over the next few weeks I&#39;ll be watching all of you - and I have plans to...educate you all in some manner or another. I have various little tests set up for all of you to curve the impending death many of you will walk into,&#34;</font>

She chuckled slowly. Her hand eased back, and curled back within the other once more. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t die or get killed, we can talk after that,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: When give a full name, respond in kind.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: I ... Am afraid I do not have a surname.
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: Nor a clan...
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A clan does not make one stronger then another.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would make his way over to a dark skinned kid</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) says: That I agree with.
<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) Daigen nodded intently as the woman spoke about the village leader&#39;s strength and her emphasis on Taijutsu. His eyes flickered back to the incident by the water, confirming the impressive display of power. Taijutsu seemed like a practical choice for someone aspiring to be a strong shinobi.

Turning to Hanamura, he appreciated her insights and wanted to learn more about her specialization.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s your specialty, Hanamura?&#34;</font> Daigen asked, curious about her skills and experiences.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: Did I miss something?
<br><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (...I could buy Blinding Seals, and be cheeky.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) turned her head to face Daigen a moment, before looking back towards Botan.
<font color = white>&#34;I doubt she is an actual leader, a high-ranked official perhaps. But I do not think she&#39;s a leader. No offense.&#34;</font>

She then lowers her head.
<font color = white>&#34;As for my specialty? I&#39;m a student. I have ... Ideas... And dreams and goals, but currently I need practice. Ninjutsu and Taijutsu, I suppose, if that&#39;s an &#39;OK&#39; answer?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#767d62>Mugen, Raku (The taciturn aspirant-Hardcore Ace) continued to stare forward as Sogeki&#39;s resolve seemed to flicker alight under the harsh layout of the higher-up&#39;s training methods. With each time the boy opened his mouth he seemed to break the otherwise hard exterior his present in hopes of being able to receive direct tutillage from the woman.

 <i><font color = white>&#34;?&#34;</font></i> - His expression was one that questioned why? Or at least, that&#39;s one would&#39;ve been right to assume from it.

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A Leader? No, I'm a Chuunin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) gaze shifted to the older dark-skinned woman with a raised brow, not having expected the village to be led by a woman.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) nods.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand. Ninjutsu and Taijutsu are great aspirations.&#34;</font>

He turns to Botan.

<font color = white>&#34;You would not consider yourself a leader, Botan chan?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Its Ms.Botan.. she's kinda famous.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: No, the others may lead. I am simply here to ensure you all have the tools needed to survive.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: And to ensure the survival of Amegakure.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Ah tools. Do you happen to have shuriken on you?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Weapons of any sort.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: and it seems I must educate you on proper words.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I am always ready to learn on anything.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: *about*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) notice that even more children were present than before. As he stood besidfe the light post, he watch from a distance as the aggressive one engaged in a conversation below. His eyes wouldn&#39;t drift at the sound of a mature voice off to the side, however he did note that the word <font color = white>&#34;Chuunin&#34;</font> had been mentioned. 

Surely in time he&#39;d cross path wirth the chuunin one way or another. As for now his thoughts were occupied with the conversation occuring south of his present position. 

<font color = white>&#34;Sogek, everything alright over there?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: A grammer lesson so early in the day. Seems this Miss Botan ain't playing around.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: On that note for those that missed it, any damage done to the village will be inflicted upon you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) creeps behind the pillar of the nearby building ever so slightly, making sure half her body is obscured in its darkness.

<font color = white>&#34;Master Matsu mentioned her once as well, so-- Eh?? Why would we damage our own home?&#34;</font> She sneered from behind the pillar.

Her pale eyes peeking at each individual around, not missing even the slightest movements.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (hm, that perk didn't raise my str.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Hanamura (The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) was still drenched, that combined with her previous help-attempted being unnecessary, did dampen her mood a bit.
But she&#39;d smile again, even as the lady Botan seemed to be &#39;frightening&#39; in a sense.

<font color = white>&#34;It was an honor and pleasure meeting you, though, lady Botan. I apologise for not knowing too much about you, if anything at all, before seeing you here.&#34;</font>

The girl shook her head before making a few steps sotuhwards.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d better get changed into dry clothing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hanamura(The soft spoken lass-XiuTheLamia) OOCs: (Southwards*)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) ears would perk up at the warning issued by the dark skinned dancer. <font color = white>&#34;Excuse me is that a new decree?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded. 

   <font color = white>&#34;People often don&#39;t take care of the things that take care of them,&#34;</font>

She replied to the pearl-lass, then she turned towards Hanamura and nodded before she began to speak once more. 

   <font color = white>&#34;No need for apologizes,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A personal rule really.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Well thats a shame, thats not how my family raises my siblings and I.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s frustration simmered as he found a quiet corner away from the bustling activity of the academy courtyard. With a determined exhale, he settled himself on the ground and closed his eyes, entering a deep meditative state. The chaotic noise of his surroundings faded into the background as he focused inward, channeling his anger and determination into a disciplined mental state.

His breathing slowed, becoming steady and controlled. The tension in his muscles gradually eased as he immersed himself in the tranquility of meditation. Images of his goals and aspirations flickered behind closed eyelids, driving him to push harder, to prove himself beyond any doubt.

As he meditated, the memory of the encounter with the dark-skinned dancer lingered in his mind. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll show you who the beggar is soon enough, NERD!&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s thoughts seethed with indignation and determination. His mind replayed the scene, the challenge laid before him, and the promise of harsh training that awaited if he could prove himself.

Each insult and dismissive remark echoed faintly in his thoughts, propelling him to show his true strength and worth. Amidst the stillness, Sogeki resolved to surpass expectations, to transform his frustration into a force that would propel him forward. The ground beneath him seemed to solidify as he embraced the peace of meditation, preparing himself mentally for the rigorous journey ahead.</font></font></font>

They said, believing they pronounced the name correctly.
<font color = white>&#34;Do you know when the academy will officially open? I don&#39;t wish to miss orientation.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) asks: ...?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I'm always training.
<br><font color=green>*Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) says: ..pfffft. Get outta here, Daigen! You know nothing of TRUE training.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Hm, perhaps I don't. Will you teach me?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Mugen, Yurei (The long-haired boy-Mirageman) crosses his arms with a light smile, thin eyes narrowing on the community.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: Ooh, A spar.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: The loser does twenty laps wearing weights.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s boastful laughter abruptly ceased when Daigen unexpectedly requested his aid. Caught off guard, Sogeki&#39;s left eyebrow quirked in surprise, and he fell into a deafening silence. He scrutinized Daigen for a solid minute, weighing the request and considering the implications.

Finally, Sogeki shrugged nonchalantly and extended his arm towards Daigen. <font color = white>&#34;If we train together, that makes us one step closer to being brothers. You understand that, right?&#34;</font> His tone was serious yet tinged with a hint of camaraderie. <font color = white>&#34;Only thing left is a nice cup of sake to seal the deal.&#34;</font>

With that, Sogeki presented Daigen with a fist bump, a gesture of solidarity and acceptance of the partnership Daigen had proposed. It was a rare moment of openness from Sogeki, acknowledging the potential bond that could be forged through shared training and mutual respect.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) squints.

Crossing his arms as he stood beside his new friend, the child would wait for a response. Hopefully it was a location with seating.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: It smells of lowborn.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry, I grew up on a farm...the smell kinds of sticks to you after so long&#34;</font>
They offered a small apology as they fessed up to the smell.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki waved off the apology, dismissing it with a wave of his hand. The scent of cabbage, while unpleasant to him, didn&#39;t warrant an apology in his eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t apologize to me, cabbage boy!&#34;</font> Sogeki huffed out a sigh, his demeanor casual despite the lingering scent. He shrugged indifferently. <font color = white>&#34;Not like you can help it. Ain&#39;t no big deal.&#34;</font>

His words carried a hint of understanding, acknowledging that personal circumstances often influenced such details. Despite his initial reaction, Sogeki&#39;s demeanor remained relaxed, showing a pragmatic acceptance of the situation.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) watched as a girl approached and sprayed a bottle of perfume at them as he spoke to the aggressive one about setting up a tournament.
-Sniff- 
The overbearing scent of harsh chemicals washed over them, and they started to sneeze.
<font color = white>&#34;Yuck! That stinks!&#34;</font> They yelled before turning back to the Aggressive one and smiled weakly at them as he tried to shake off the scent of the perfume 
<font color = white>&#34;Thanks man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the aggressive one for a moment as they gathered their thoughts to get back to the topic of the spar/ tournament
<font color = white>&#34;Right...so we should start asking around to see who would be interested in joining up.&#34;</font>
They looked to Botan, who was still nearby.
<font color = white>&#34;Maybe even ask a chuunin to oversee it as well....it could get the other students interested in participating.&#34;</font>
It was a simple suggestion, but to them, it would give the students more motivation to join them as they could show off what they knew to the higher-ups.</font></font></font>
