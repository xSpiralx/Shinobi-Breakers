<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) says: I think she ran off on a mission with some others.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) says: Or, I mean. A job.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Hey Saigosame, hows your training coming alone?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) says: Well, considering we've not actually been taught any elemental jutsu yet, it's... Not, really.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) says: So, I'm just focusing on my agility for now.

<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) says: Mhm...
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Hi there Atkin!
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Atkin? Why does that sound so familiar?
<br><font color=green>*Shanin (The black haired teen-Toopher2) yells: Because it's his name!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Takeshi, Ito (The ragged man-Red-Suit and Tie) smirked. He had managed to land a solid blow against one; if it wasn&#39;t for the fact his head was currently screaming at him he could have added more back into that blow. 

He was starting to get himself into an adjustment; and as they all motioned to surround him and thus engage him once more? He was ready; a brief flash of movement, and he twisted about nearing a half-step leap upwards. 

Those blows creaked along below him. Those arms attempting to grasp him, and those Shuriken seemly curved along. They were about to crash into each other, and that simply aided him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Oh?! Its time to put my back into it!,&#34;</font>

A shift of his body; he was floating albeit briefly - the world coaxed into a near halt, and suddenly he dropped his arm forth and the length of steel seemed to coax along the air. 

A brief eruption of sparks fluttering into view, and suddenly an explosion of intense HEAT! OH MY WHAT WAS THIS?! He was starting to glow; an AURA began to flare up. He had begun to build up his HEAT BAR!

   <font color = white>&#34;OHHHHH YAH! ITO STYLE SUPER INTENSE FLAME CUT!,&#34;</font>

That heat erupted into a brief X along the ground, and then BOOM! He landed nearby.
