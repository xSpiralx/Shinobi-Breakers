<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) settled into her own seat, though all the running around hadn&#39;t appeared to weather her by much. Senju were simply built different stamina-wise.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll have the double-udon with pork, a scoop of chicken, extra carrots, two bowls of fish cakes, and a slice of the day&#39;s pie, please.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly starts to roll around on the roof half asleep. It seems the smell of fresh food was starting make him unconciously hungry as drool slowly starts to slip out from his mouth saying.

<font color = white>&#34;Mmmm... Udon!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) gave a hearty laugh when hearing Hanako take the long way around to ordering a ramen. <font color = white>&#34;Y-yeah, he must&#39;ve had something in his eye.&#34;</font> He wipes a way a tear. Damn, these people he met today were just too much.

It would take a bit before his barbecue as finally served, and he even got a new weird guy sitting right beside him.  He would keep an eye on him in case he was one of those food thieves.

<font color = white>&#34;By the way, what did you all think of the first academy day? Wasn&#39;t like what I expected.&#34;</font> He thought it would be all about learning how to fight and putting it to practice.

Hearing the purple guy on the roof, he made another order. <font color = white>&#34;An udon as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninaest ninja-HoboCat) seemed far too healthy to be a food thief. Though with that on record, it also seemed as though the ninja was so far-removed from the idea of a food shortage that the kid's caution would go unquestioned. 

The odds of the two seeing one another as weird were high.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) swiveled around in her chair, taking liberal advantage of its <i>spin</i>. It gave her prime viewing vantage for watching the ol&#39; Ramen Boss slap together their respective orders. It hardly took long at all. Everything was ready to be tossed onto the grill, if not already boiling. Minutes later? They were presented with bowls and plated morsels. 

<font color = white>&#34;Mmm..? It was.. very hands on. And by hands on I mean, like.. hands on rocks. We touched a lot of rocks today. I&#39;m not a rock person! I&#39;ve never climbed a cliff. But. I think I did, like, pretty good--&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) didn&#39;t seem bothered with the rather gargantuan amount of food she was suddenly served up. A double-portion of noodles? With triple the toppings? A double portion of fish cakes on the side?! &lt;i&gt;Dessert?!?&lt;/i&gt;

She settled in to eat her meal when she no doubts felt the dog mozy on up to the stall for a moment before absconding once more.

<font color = white>&#34;...Ah.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) glanced between her food. Then the road. Then her food again...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) started picking up the barbecue, but not before downing the water cup he had asked for. He really wanted to catch that dog, anything that could put him ahead of Shishorama or the others. <font color = white>&#34;Not leftovers, I asked it for you. You&#39;re a loud sleeper.&#34;</font>

Anyhow, barbecue now in a box!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) selfishly took her bowl with her. She's slurping down the what she could while she waddles her way into the river. Yes. <b>Into</b> the river. She just straight up disappears down there. 

Bubbles float to the surface seconds later. An underwater groan when she realized her dastardly plot to have her own meal for herself backfired. It washed away, right out the bowl, with the current. Welp!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) shifted in-between the buildings to hide away, still munching away on her fish cakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was very confused by what he saw Hanako doing... just going down into the river with her bowl of Ramen.

Anyhow! The box with barbecue was placed in the middle of the street. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll go hide on the roof of the restaurant.&#34;</font> He grabbed the Udon and climbed up there, handing it over to the sleepy purple guy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: Dogs can't help responding to barks.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) sits behind the tree, surprised on how so far there is no sign of the Dog- He wondered how far the little guy wandered when they even left food for the pup.

Did the dog get that far already?</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) socked a small-mouthed bass in the eye for getting too close to her. 
Nasty things. Minutes elapsed.

A need for air never arrived. Not like how the Senju described it. There was no pains in her chest. No stinging in her eyes. No signs of fatigue at all really. She felt nice and collected. Haze was the furthest thing from her mind. She's focused on the vague sensation of presences beyond the surface. So far--

<i>Just us. No dog.. huh. Maybe he'll come back when he feels enough time passed for us to leave? They probably have it down to a science, since he comes scavenging for food here often. He probably knows after people depart, that's the best time to find leftovers?</i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) slowly jumps down from the rooftop as he lands onto the ground making a small poof of dust before walking towards one of the stools as if nothing had happen.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) wasn't so sure it even worked. Perhaps they'd missed their chance for the dog at this time, but at leasy she hadn't missed her lunch-- except for the slice of pumpkin pie currently plated on the table in the stand. She was eagerly waiting for the moment for the op to be called off so she could greedily consume it.

For she was no longer in possession of any fish cakes, they were all gone.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) reacted to detecting movement towards the center of the road rather than the voices. She couldn&#39;t really hear much under the water. Her head poked out.

He paused to give her time to give her name, before continueing

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (why build sensory, just tank everything that comes your way and get monstrous body
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (lol )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) accepted both! Whether she recognised the name or not was hard to gauge however, but she remained respectfully court either way. The note was stared at for a moment, though, before it was carefully tucked away within an inner pocket of her cloak.

<font color = white>&#34;Understood, sir. I&#39;ll make certain the trade is worth its value if such a thing becomes necessary.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninjaest ninja-HoboCat) drew a set of dice and showed them. It didn't seem like the ninja was a man of many words.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama(The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) OOCs: (The hardest part about monstrous body is finding a playby the admins are happy with.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) says: Sir you have to speak.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Agorato (The ninjaest ninja-HoboCat) sighed. His one weakness was going to speak. And so he did. It was hard to take it seriously as his words were almost like when a person inhales hilium.
