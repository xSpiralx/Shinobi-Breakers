<font color = white>&#34;mhm!..definately missed a spy execution...which we can all talk about on the way to our clan home&#34;</font>

She paused as she later released them with a ligher laughter leaving her lips.</font></font></font>

The youth moved in to tap on Reilin's shoulder, checking to see one more time.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) blinks a few times as he looks toward the old man. After an awkward and abrupt pause, he clears his throat. Nodding and apparently calming down a great deal.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;And if I am rendered the victor, I will only accept the sum.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmmm
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Not exactly, Tsuneko. It would be with Fubuki about.

<font color = white>&#34;She currently holds... An amount that is greater than five-hundred ryo. If you wish to raise beyond five-hundred... We&#39;ll need to participate with her present.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirls her lengthy black hair as she pondered the thought. Honestly she&#39;d have thought this through much more, but her train of thought was interrupted not once, but twice already due to certain circumstances involving their higher-ups.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s very tempting ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she said, looking toward Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;But she&#39;s right. The last ante we had.. well you didn&#39;t quite honour that. You did show me some cash before but yer&#39; track record doesn&#39;t really uh.. inspire confidence. This is a -big- bet, ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she stated.</font></font></font>

Seemed like business as usual to him, though he was unaware of something might be going on. He waves to the group and stands idly by. Just in case there was a gathering for a reason</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) whispers faintly.

<font color = white>&#34;I feel a ton better. Thank you, old man.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) simply unveiled three-hundred ryo, counting each individual bill arduously in front of the young Uchiha.
Well--actually, on top of her head. <font color = white>&#34;I would expect you of anyone to understand the weight this... <i>demurral</i> entails.&#34;</font> One hundred Ryo.

The Zhu slowed down his count, moving further and further into a more visceral tone when he spoke, <font color = white>&#34;There is value within these mere paper marks. Indeed, such an amount--I believe your tongue for it would represent... Divinity? Roughly of course, though I would be astonished for you to recognize such a phrase.&#34;</font> One-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;Merely, in a triviality--it would represent a net gain for you, would it not?&#34;</font> Two-Hundred.
<font color = white>&#34;Just a simple game that you have succeeded in many a process.&#34;</font> Two-Twenty-Five. <font color = white>&#34;<i>What is to prevent you from....</i>&#34;</font> Two-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Complete and utter dominion?</b>&#34;</font>Two-Seventy-Five.

With twenty-five ryo in hand, the boy places it a the Uchiha girl&#39;s nose.
<font color = white>&#34;Defeat me. That provides one-thousand Ryo. And any form of assistance you would comprise.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm here for you all, youngster.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: So- What's even going on over there...? Meixun are you really gonna risk being her slave just to keep gambling?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) took another sip of something and knocked himself right out! The liqour bottle was now emptied and Tooki can sleep soundly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) was astonished and completely taken aback for a moment. Was this boy, no this insect really counting his money on her head?! Of all places. This was nothing but utter disrespect. Who could assume it was otherwise. She grasped at the money, balling it tightly in a fist before thrusting it back into his chest with a bit of force. The Uchiha returned it. Her anger was prevalent and she hadn&#39;t even bothered to hide it.

She&#39;d continue to press into his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.....&#34;</font> she tried her best to contain her anger which resulted from the blatant condescension he&#39;d just exhibited. <font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t just a gambler. Maybe I didn&#39;t represent myself well enough. I&#39;m bein&#39; nice right now. So be happy. Happy I ain&#39;t Kickin&#39;. Yer&#39;. Ass and takin&#39; yer money after using my head as a table for your money.&#34;</font> her finger jabbed into the boy&#39;s chest with a few of the words she&#39;d uttered. 

<font color = white>&#34;You might just be the dumbest smart person I&#39;ve ever met.&#34;</font> she scoffed. <font color = white>&#34;Now then. I&#39;ll gamble with ya&#39;. And when I beat ya&#39; and if you can&#39;t pay up. Well, I&#39;m gettin&#39; my money from you.. from Fubuki. From whoever there is. But don&#39;t forget who yer&#39; dealin&#39; with, alright?&#34;</font> 

She&#39;d calmed herself down by now and withdrew her hand from his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s have some fun. I wanna take my mind offa&#39; that ugly execution anyhow.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Don't bet, Reilin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) beckons the beige-haired youth over and gestures across the road.

<font color = white>&#34;The blueberry is a gambling addict. He&#39;s trying to sell himself, and money he doesn&#39;t have, to keep gambling and try to the girl in front of him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I also take no responsibility for his addiction. That game of two-hundred awoke something in him and it's not my fault.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I blame Reilin, honestly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) rubs the back of his head watching his kin blow up. He wasn’t entirely sure what was going on beyond the gambling. However. Using his cousins head for a table wasn’t cool.

He clenches fist and shakes a little, but Reilin had herself handled. Even within their own village it seemed there might be people to look about. That was kind of a worrisome sentiment.

But...surely the all of aspirant meant no disrespect? But he didn’t say so either. The boy, for his first time, was truly conflicted on whether to get angry or keep calm</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;I refuse, Raku. Unfortunately, this is no mere sport.&#34;</font> Not anymore, at least.

The boy unveils the set of cards, Human, Animal, Plant. He reveals the full amount to the Uchiha girl, prior to connecting the stack back together--handing it over to Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;As per usual, Tsuneko roles as the mediator--a non partisan. Should she rein the victory? The bout is nulled, Should she be victorious alongside one of us? The victor is the challenger.&#34;</font> Sure, a simple set of rulings, nothing&#39;s quite changed.

<font color = white>&#34;... <b><i>Xieji</b></i>. Eleven bouts.&#34;</font> A sudden deathmatch, winner takes all.

Who will reign supreme? Meixun&#39;s pride against Reilin&#39;s own? Meixun&#39;s devilish temperament against Reilin&#39;s fury-driven luck?

It is a challenge of.... Well it&#39;s probably not <i>that</i> important, they are just kids settling their petty differences.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Eleven? So high?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I suppose it's a large sum.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro)

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I would blame my sister... Yet we have yet to parttake in such an event.

<font color = white>&#34;I s&#39;pose it&#39;s fair to lower if we&#39;re even then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: If you insist.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Let's continue.

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: C'mon, Tsuneko don't doze off on us just yet.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) quickly switches his index and middle fingers on his right hand to form the ok (three fingers) symbol on the said hand, pointing it over to the Uchiha.

All that stalling just for--

<font color = white>&#34;Four. We were null for five bouts subsequenting your fourth victory.&#34;</font> The boy held his right hand firmly, granting her a fifth finger. 

She only needs one left to win anyhow, meanwhile...
He needs four.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: So I did need to count for you...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: Yes you did!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Eleven bouts, if you were to win totally, you would require a minimum of six victories.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: You hold five, I hold three.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Good sir.. By my count, I'm already -at- six.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) scoffed, clearly the girl was attempting to con him. I mean, she did win a few solid bouts, all he had to do was look back on them and...

<font color = white>&#34;Yes yes. You won the fourth and fifth bouts pretty swell, however whenever we arrived to our sixth bout, to which Tsuneko gracefully interrupted my v--&#34;</font> Wait.

<font color = white>&#34;S-Sixth.... Bout...&#34;</font> The sixth bout? Didn&#39;t he choose animal? An--

<i>She won the sixth bout</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What did I disrupt?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled a shit-eating grin. Looking directly toward Meixun. She relished in her victory, soaking in his expression right now as the realization had dawned on him. He&#39;d lost. He&#39;d lost without even knowing it. Admittedly she too was a bit air-headed and hadn&#39;t even realized she won. But to lose whilst unaware was an entirely different thing.

She decided to draw a final card but did not flip it up this time around. She merely placed it down face down and ended her turn.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game.&#34;</font> as he hand pulled off of the card she turned it at the wrist, palm outstretched. <font color = white>&#34;You owe me a lot of money.&#34;</font> she said, still grinning and awaiting her deposit.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Good luck getting it, Reilin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) Five-Hundred Ryo. Down the drain.

For what, exactly? He didn't really <i>want</i> the money. Only the victory, but he couldn't even afford that much. His brain was circling indefinitely: the character for six, dancing about his head, collapsing on his thoughts with a paperweight keeping a stack from falling--though the stack is stacked too high, the paperweight only uses the stack as a diving boad and knocks it over. Translating every piece of paper with one singular character.

<b><i>6</b></i>

Two-Hundred Ryo, a crumpled mess--caused wholeheartedly by himself, returned back to its rightful wielder.

And....And now....

And now.... The remaining three-hundred.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled softly as a sum of money was placed in her palm. She uncrinkled the mess of it and instead of feeling happiness, she was confused. Her head fell to a tilt. <font color = white>&#34;I must be losing my vision.. Or I can&#39;t count properly.&#34;</font> she said. She lifted the money to hold it up to the sun but with all the sand, dirt and debris flying about it was hard to see fully. Nevertheless it was painfully obvious; this was not 500 ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Is this going to transform into 500 in a moment?&#34;</font> she asked, lowering the money now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: T-T-T-Tha....Is T-wo...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I warned you he was betting with money he didn't have.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Two...Two-Hu.....
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Where's the rest, Blueberry?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I-I...t It is.....
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: This is even less than you counted on my head.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why are you holding out on me?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Told ya, good luck collecting your winnings.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: He'll pay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) wore the slightest condolence in his eyes, for the dark side of gambling throwing someone into the red so rapidly and mercilessly. He gave slow shakes of head to the scene. 

<font color = white>&#34;Gambling is truly a dangerous vice.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It really is- Oh, I didn't even see you Katora. Hey.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Good evening, Hideo. I'm surprised you didn't join them.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Got tired of losing ryo?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Just wasn't in the mood
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Fair, fair.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) How could he have been defeated!?

Actually

<b>BANG</b>

The boy knocked himself in the head, sticking out his tongue, Gon style.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry. Forgot one thing. I&#39;ve never won a single time I&#39;ve partook in such a challenge.&#34;</font>

He unveiled the final remains of the Ryo, smacking Reilin on the head playfully.
<font color = white>&#34;I would&#39;ve suspected a bloodhound such as yoruself to be able to recognize the stench of a proper sum... Ah well, suppose not.&#34;</font>
He still has the audacity to goad? Well, of course he does.
<i>He lost, he doesn&#39;t have anything left to lose anyhow.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hehehe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) side eyes Reilin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Suppose that settle's that, then.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Did he ever pay the remainder from the previous bet?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Youuuuuuu.....
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Meeeeeeeeee....
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Feels like I'm watching a crime.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Financial Murder. In broad daylight. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I believe the term is.... Extortion..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Its a crime he commit against himself, really.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s glee quickly returned to her. She added the remaining 300 to her stack of cash and thumbed through it to validate that it was all there. Once it was, the Uchiha tucked it away neatly in her kimono for safe keeping.

Though her smile had not faded just yet, she looked at him expectantly and without saying anything. Wide-eyed and staring. She heard his most recent words and this was her reaction. An unwavering stare, eyebrows risen in arches.

Finally breaking her silence. <font color = white>&#34;As I clarified before we began -and- you agreed. I get the 500 -and- you become my subordinate.. Did ya&#39; foerget?&#34;</font> she asked. <font color = white>&#34;I believe -your- response was... &#39;Should you retain the victory.&#39;..&#34;</font> her fingertips found themselves instinctively creating a finger-pryamid. Villainy.

<font color = white>&#34;Did ya&#39; forget? Huh? Did ya&#39;, did ya&#39;?&#34;</font> her brows rose even more, if that were possible. <font color = white>&#34;I guess -I- forgot about the initial 30 you still owed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. It's why I stay away from high-stakes gambles.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: A-Ah.. Subor...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (who took a bigger L. The prisoner or Meixun? find out next time on Shinobi Breaker Z)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Aaah soo sorrie! Not from dees land, no understand many words! Wel--Okey ByeBye Now!&#34;</font> 

He makes a mad dash for it, a maddeningly mad dash for it. So mad of a dash that the dust storm seemed to hold a horizontal vortex where Meixun once stood.

<font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Tomorrow! I promise you&#39;ll be allowed to... Aah! We shall discuss it further tomorrow!!!</b></i>&#34;</font> He screamed into the storm while fleeing.

[Gettin tf outta dodge]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) slicked his hair back, to uncover his ear. Almost believing that he&#39;s misheard them just now.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh. She&#39;s even becoming his Boss now? What&#39;s next? Did you wager years of each other&#39;s lifespans too?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Crazy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Almost, yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: He wagered being a slave or something.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) hadn&#39;t expected this turn of events to unfold. Meixun made a run for it! And a fast one too. Much too fast for her to keep up with even if she wanted. Though she didn&#39;t mind, he&#39;d have to come around sooner or later. 

<font color = white>&#34;Right. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be seein&#39; ya&#39;, Henchmen #1.&#34;</font> she called out as he disappeared out into the storm.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) placed her hands on her hips. <font color = white>&#34;Im Chobina Akimichi. Its nice to meet you.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh, you look like you're kinda related to Reilin, Suzaku.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9970c1>Uchiha, Suzaku (The onyx-eyed girl-IAmAtomic) brought her balled-up fists to her eyes, rubbing them gently as if the morning light was too much to bear. She blinked, trying to focus, and as her vision cleared, she found herself squinting at Chobina.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a pleasure to meet you too, Chobin.,&#34;</font> she said, her voice still held the softness of sleep. She lowered her body into a formal, polite bow, a gesture of respect that seemed almost out of place in the haze of early morning.

Rising slowly, she hesitated, her mind drifting to the conversation she had overheard earlier. Her face adopted a puzzled expression, and she bit her lip, nervousness flickering across her features. The corner of her lips twitched as she struggled with the question she felt compelled to ask.

Fingers twiddling, she finally spoke, her voice barely above a whisper, <font color = white>&#34;Is it true someone was beheaded?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) I nod my head. <font color = white>&#34;I wasnt there thankfully, but I heard about it. It was pretty day but thats what criminals get.&#34;</font>

The cubby girl was tired herself but she was head to bed rather than waking up. She had a bit of time to spare though.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was trying to forget everything that had happened the day before, but the moment someone brought it up all the bad memories came flooding her at once, emotionally overwhelming her. The girl put her hand on her stomach while avoiding looking at anyone, her gaze fixated on the water in front of her.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, they executed a prisoner and made us watch, but that wasn&#39;t the worst part. It was right before that when things got ugly. It still makes me feel sick thinking about it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah... It was a bit more than just a beheading...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (myy daily...finally...ken spec...)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) yawned into her palm <font color = white>&#34;That is so. Such acts will keep us safe, as I was explaining to Hideo here.&#34;</font> she gave the boy a wink. As if they shared some secret. 

<font color = white>&#34;I have considered taking up the practice myself. If we behead anyone who faces us then noone will question Iwagakure when we step outside our walls.&#34;</font> she yawned again and looked up at the sky.

<font color = white>&#34;About time I rest however....good day children.&#34;</font> she say and give them all a bow before making her way to a bench to snooze.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (guh Ken spec before cores?! How brave)

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: That's what dad said, Old Man Tooki. That we were weak compared to the prisoner guy.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Well we don't have any cool jutsu to train and weapons are super expensive...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I am so close to getting a katana...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: How much more do you need?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Flame in the eyes, determination, etcetera. Not actual flames. No... you youngsters with elemental ninjutsu would be troublesome.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Just three-hundred left.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: C'mere Fubuki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walked up to Hideo. <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (also i gotta run an errand and will brb for 15 mins)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) reaches into his pocket and produces a very crumpled wad of, what was probably, three-hundred ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Here, get a super cool sword.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) looked at the wad of money and immediately shaked her head while waving her arms.

<font color = white>&#34;No, you don&#39;t need to do it really! I appeciate it but like, it&#39;s a lot.&#34;</font> Fubuki spoke quickly due to being flustered, it was an unexpectedly cool moment from Hideo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) shakes his head and gestures with the money again,

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about it, spending money makes me happy.&#34;</font>

Lowering the money slightly he smiles. How blessed was he that getting money was his primary goal solely because spending it made him happier... He, however, does not miss an opportunity to be slightly snide,

<font color = white>&#34;Even though you&#39;re sometimes mean and lame. You <i>do</i> need a sword so you can actually fight and stuff. All I need is my dad to stop being lazy and teach me jutsu.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i feel rly bad bc i gotta afk even if only for a bit right after this so i dont wanna seem ungrateful ooc)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Lmao dw
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo(The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) OOCs: (Tyt
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Aw, Hideo's being noble.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm always noble!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) scratched her head while thinking about it, she couldn&#39;t even jokingly bully him. So many people had already helped her and she couldn&#39;t help people back. Eventually she caved in and sighed.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay fine. I accept it if you insist. But for my next katana I&#39;ll try to make the money on my own -- and if you need ANY help, you ask me. You got that?&#34;</font>

She stepped forward and put her hands on her hips, looking at him seemingly upset though her face betrayed her intentions, which were just being serious about her promise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (GRAHHH)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) nods his head and hands her the money, <font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;m immediately calling in my favor; be less mean to me.&#34;</font>

With that handled, he spins to face the old man. Using his still out-stretched hand, now freed of money, to point at him.

<font color = white>&#34;I totally heard you say us having elemental jutsu would be &#39;troublesome&#39;! I&#39;m gonna learn to throw fireballs <b>and</b> mountains and it&#39;ll be the complete opposite of troublesome! It&#39;ll be... helpful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) immediately nodded and grabbed the money, putting it alongside her stash. Just enough for the katana she had ordered.

<font color = white>&#34;Deal. I&#39;ll only be mean if you&#39;re mean to me though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Damn, I guess that's fair.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I appreciate the donation but I won't become a punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: You have my word I won't start shit though.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I would never treat you like one! I'm usually the punching bag.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Heh, true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Trust me man I may laugh and smile but it tooootallly sucks most of the time.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: If it makes you feel better, I was always joking. Sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, I figured. Thank you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think Tsuneko may be the only one that actually means it... I 'unno.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Nah, she's messing with you too.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I don't think anyone actually hates anyone else here.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hrm, I hope so.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) rested his good eye on Hideo while the other glances at Fubuki. He&#39;d let out a troubled sigh as he thought about his days of fighting against ninjutsu.

<font color = white>&#34;Helpful how?&#34;</font>, he questioned as he removed a glass from his sleeve and quickly took a sip.

<font color = white>&#34;You youngsters are something else.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I 'unno I figure throwing mountains could probably help someone somehow. Lemmie get there first. I'll worry about what I do when I'm there, when I'm there!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, very true.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) saw the man look at them each with a separate eye and couldn&#39;t get that mental image out of her mind. It just might be more traumatizing than yesterday.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, what would be helpful then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Maybe someone will ask me to relocate a mountain range or something heroic like that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like, literally carving a path through the mountains or something. That'd probably be super helpful.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Took much plate shifting with cause an earthquake.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'll make the earth stop moving, easy.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hey, I'd be the one carving through the mountains with my sword.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Swords.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Fair. But I bet I could just like... rip chunks out of the mountain super easy.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Carve a valley with my barehands...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Like diggin' through sand at the beach...
<br><font size=-4><font color=white>*Uchiha, Suzaku has gone AUTOAFK*
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) asks: My idea of being helpful is selfish. I would make sure I'd use ninjutsu to protect the crops and livestock! How could I sleep with a full stomach if there's no food?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah but that's like- obvious stuff! I thought wanted unique examples or something!
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I'm a simple man.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: My way of being helpful will be cutting down anyone who attacks us.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800000>Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) had a delusional smile on his face as he remembered the cheers of the crowds that gathered around him.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Mm, the small stuff is usually glanced over until those things are needed.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Huh I guess that's true.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I guess all the small stuff would probably be good training too right?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Damn right, if you're going to reach your -goal- then you're gonna have to leave no stone unturned.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think it might be literal stones when it comes to doton training.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: Hmm, I see what you did there.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Say, Old Man Tooki, what kinds of stuff did you do when you were 'cleaning up the streets'?
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was full of energy and brimming with taijutsu mastery.
<br><font color=green>*Tooki (The handsome man-Are You Done Yet) says: I was gaining experience left and right, finishing fights fast.
