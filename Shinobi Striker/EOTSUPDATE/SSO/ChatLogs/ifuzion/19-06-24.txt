<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) unwraps his belt from around his middle. His robes stayed tightly around his body, perhaps something else was holding it in place.

The belt was deceivingly long, the students around him would notice. He held on to one end of the fabric while he tossed the other end forward towards Sogeki, the material seemingly stretching as it headed towards it's target.

The belt would begin to wrap around Sogeki, tightening in a second and restraining all movements but speech.

He would release the bind before it became permanent the following turn.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Matsu, the Hyuuga martial artist, unwrapped his deceptive belt from around his waist, Sogeki observed with a keen, calculating gaze. The fabric seemed unnaturally long, hinting at hidden abilities or techniques beyond its mundane appearance. Sogeki remained outwardly composed, though his mind analyzed the unfolding situation with meticulous detail.

As Matsu tossed one end of the belt towards him, Sogeki noted the fluid motion and the controlled extension of the fabric. The belt surged forward, the material stretching unnaturally as it closed the distance between them with surprising speed.

The fabric wrapped around Sogeki swiftly, tightening with a suddenness that restricted his movements but allowed him to speak. He felt the constricting pressure against his body, a calculated move by Matsu to assert control and limit his freedom momentarily.

Maintaining his calm demeanor, Sogeki subtly wiped his palm against his vest, smearing a thin layer of sweat from his skin onto the fabric. It was a small, tactical move—preparing himself mentally and physically for any further developments in the encounter.

While outwardly restrained, Sogeki's focus remained sharp and unwavering. His eagle-like vision scanned the surrounding area, assessing the reactions of the students and bystanders. He remained alert for any sign of aggression or opportunistic movement, his mind calculating potential threats and strategies with cool precision.

Despite the temporary restraint, Sogeki's eyes conveyed a silent warning to those around him—a reminder of his readiness to respond swiftly and decisively to any challenge. His posture remained relaxed yet poised, a testament to his training and experience as a shinobi who thrived in moments of controlled chaos.

As Matsu prepared to release the binding, Sogeki awaited the moment with a measured patience, ready to assess the situation and determine his next course of action. The encounter had tested his resolve and adaptability, reinforcing his reputation as a shinobi who navigated challenges with calculated precision and unwavering focus.</font></font></font>

He looked ready to deliver the Hyuuga's famous open palm blows. He pulled his right back back at the hip level, building momentum. However, instead of an open palm, he curled his fingers forwards resembling a grasping motion.

To those looking at his hand, they would see each finger glow a menacingly purple color in turn - starting with the pinky. In a swift strike, he would slam the fingers into the Hoshigaki's middle.

The blow did not seem to hurt the boy, he could feel something was OFF about him.</font></font></font>

However...

It barely moved the Hoshigaki, simply inching them back half a stepas the shark blinked in confusion. They peered down at their body from under that large straw hat, then back up at the Hyuuga, then back down, and back up once more.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m... Not entirely sure what that did, but it did <b>something</b>.&#34;</font>, they remarked, moving their arms, their legs, rolling their neck - Something was off, but they couldn&#39;t quite figure out what just yet.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) watched as each of the Jounin's fingers glowed with visible chakra, and their breath hitched.

Their brow furrowed for a moment, before widening in shock.

Bracing his abs, and lowering his body as far as he can by pushing his hips back and bending his knees. Pausing and then pushing himself back into the starting position. That was only one repetition. Now it was time to do many more until failure!</font></font></font>

A brief twist of movement could be noted; and she vanished into a blinding blur of immense speed and raw agility. She appeared directly before him, and looked down towards him. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You do, yes,&#34;</font>

A fist was launched directly towards his stomach - she didn&#39;t care about the back-talk but this man has ushered forth something previously, and she had to repay the kind for what he had done. 

   <font color = white>&#34;You threw a rock at my cat,&#34;</font>

She then drew her fist back, and simply moved to let him fall accordingly.

Without hesitation he reacts by headbutt=ing his head in to the fist to take on even greater force of the strike.
(Damage Cap raised to Critical)

Sending himself flying back off the contact and then splashing in to the water. A familiar sensation. Though last time he enjoyed flying higher in the air. For a moment he was under the water and eventually surfaced.

His pair of shirts was missing and he lacked shoes. Quite literally punched right out of his clothing.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh. The PAIN!&#34;</font>
Gripping his chest as many tears began to shed. Now floating on top of the water as he swayed around at its will.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright...&#34;</font>

He would then simply jump into the water, swimming over to the injured boy and grabbing him by his underarms, then proceeding to use a half back stroke to swim back to the edge of the water and pull both himself and the boy out of the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp... Anybody wanna take him to the hospital?&#34;</font>

He didn&#39;t seem too thrilled on the aspect of transporting blast to the hospital so he hoped somebody else could do it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was holding on to a thread of his consciousness.
<font color = white>&#34;A hospital?&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;They&#39;ll put me further in to the system. Can&#39;t have that.&#34;</font>
Grabbing hold of that thread a bit tighter and forcing himself to withstand the crucial pain from the recent assault.

Looking to the one known as...Tatsu? Maybe. He cared little for any names. They were still students and it wasn&#39;t like he shared life or death with them in the field of unknown battle outside of their home.
<font color = white>&#34;You are a good guy. Stay that way.&#34;</font>
Giving him a thumbs up along with a smile that went with it.

<font color = white>&#34;Well... Okay then, no problem.&#34;</font>

He would return the thumbs up and then look around for the boy&#39;s clothes which may have ended up being washed away in the water.

<font color = white>&#34;You might wanna put some clothes on though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Seems like it might be too early for questions.. I&#39;ll come back later. Be a darling Sha-chan, and ask your young friends if they would be interested in the prospect of purchasing designer clothes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
