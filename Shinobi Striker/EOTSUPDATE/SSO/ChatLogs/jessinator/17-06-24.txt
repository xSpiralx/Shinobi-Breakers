     A palm became a stone splitting the rushing river that was the kid&#39;s Brutish Hand. Harmlessly smacking them in the wrist to divert the trajectory of their grab. Those fingers of theirs merely close around empty air. 

In turn? He drives a speedy jab directly for the kid&#39;s sternum.
<font color = white>&#34;Not bad. I can tell you hit decent hard.&#34;</font>
Compliments paid where they were due, while he side steps a tad. Keeping both of his enemies within sight.

A simple skip backwards was all it took to clear the grab. Only to stomp right back into reach, aiming to tear the guy&#39;s Ribbon under his sandal&#39;s tread. Again!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) snickered softly. <font color = white>&#34;Well I did think you could hold out for a little while longer, but I suppose I couldn&#39;t beat him on my own.&#34;</font> with this, the Uchiha took a breath before rushing forward to finally join the fray. Admittedly with her impressively slow speed it&#39;d take her a moment still before she would be able to get into the mix.

But given just how nimble Katora was, winning wasn&#39;t likely an option. She&#39;d take a moment to survey just how many ribbons Chonamu had. She&#39;d now be standing firmly face to face with each of them. But who would she target first?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) never underestimated an enemy. 
      Overestimation was key. Despite not showcasing such thus far, he suspected the Uchiha might be capable of clearing the distance to him in one stride, which would spell trouble if they saved such like a Trump Card. 

Therefore...
     As the latest heavy-weight hammer of a punch came for him? The Fuma Student dared to dash CLOSER! Yes, he darts into their guard, slanting out the way of that devastating STRAIGHT! It doesn&#39;t even clip him as he, quite literally, ran two steps up their torso. 

Chakra Adhesion of the Wall Walking technique made such tactics possible. He used them as a human springboard, pushing off his second step into a full moonsault, gone flying backwards. He landed on his feet and used the momentum to skip himself even farther. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve spent a good amount of time observing while we&#39;ve tired each other out... so I think I&#39;ve earned a breather.&#34;</font>

He points a finger at Katora. <font color = white>&#34;Enjoy victory...One day I&#39;ll beat you  all by myself and you&#39;ll have to treat me to a meal.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (No issues from me)
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Guess I joined in too late, Ah well.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Well even as i originally stated Fuma,Katora is our winnner congrats boy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) pats Reilin's back.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) offered the Akimichi a slight, yet respectful bow of head.
<font color = white>&#34;Deal.&#34;</font> 

One could not see such, given he&#39;s wearing a mask, though hints lingered in his eyes. He&#39;s smiling. 

<font color = white>&#34;I have to say. I expected the team up, but I was hoping I could take out at least one of you. Before the other caught up. We&#39;ve all got a long way to go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) hiuffs a bit  <font color = white>&#34;too much exericse from my eariler fight ....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I wonder what your prize will be.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I'd be willing to split it, once I get it. This was a draw, after all.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: I could've played keep away forever, while you could've given chase forever.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Until exhaustion killed us all.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Granted... I have no idea what your reflexes are like, so maybe I could've blitzed you? Too late to find out now.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Not sure if you can split it, i dont even know what the reward is.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: So you'll have to talk to that blonde hair guy about it.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Well, my plan was to let Chonamu take a bit of damage while he wittled away at your defenses to a point where he and I could take you out in one shot. Then I'd be able to finish him off. But it was poor execution on my part.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I did have it planned out, though. You were just too crafty as well
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. We'll wait for my twin to give us the details.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) took a seat right there in the middle of the arena. 
No, he felt the mood strike to lay down completely.
A worn out sigh left him, while he stared at the clouds above. 

<font color = white>&#34;Good fight, you two. It was as mentally taxing as it was physically demanding.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) yells: You have a twin?!
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: No. But. He's looks just like me, despite that truth.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: We're both wearing masks too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) Takes a series of deep breaths. He&#39;d really pushed him  self hard today a total of four opponets for an obese kid was insane. <font color = white>&#34;Someone say twin??? My sister&#39;s on a self care day....Think she&#39;s getting her Nail&#39;s done.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Two back to back fights, and a free for all in the end.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: I need more money.

She commented to herself with a stretch and a trot off to make sure all was well. Should it be, she would go back into a relaxed state</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Where in the hell....did I leave my brush?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) sniffs, <font color = white>&#34;Still smells like dog piss..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Someone should do something about that
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) asks: heh. You never know with these children old man. Did you need something?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yawns lazily as he joins the crowd of Iwagakure&#39;s kids. As he takes a comfortable seat, the old geezer would begin writing some notes as he planned his next trip to the next village.
<font color = white>&#34;Good morning kids.&#34;</font> he greets the group as he barely manges to recognize their blurry figures despite his aging eyesight <font color = white>&#34;Seems like most of you are still half asleep though..&#34;</font> he sighs as he notices the silence and occasional snoring <font color = white>&#34;I swear.. kids these days live too comfortably.. when I was your age I would be already awake organizing wares.. tsk-tsk!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) turned her gaze to the darker skinned old man to the other old man....A village of past and new.

<font color = white>&#34;Is that so?&#34;</font> She said slowly. She resisted the urge to say more about it.

<font color = white>&#34;In any case merchant. What deals do you have on blades? I have very little Ryo as a down payment&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (from xD sorry was in valorant.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (dw, I am just chillin
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) pockets away his notebook as he turns toward the young teen. Though he struggled in both sight and hearing, the old man would still make an effort to understand.. though failing miserably.

<font color = white>&#34;What deals.. on ladles?&#34;</font> he repeats, wondering how poor the kid must had been to not even have the ryo to buy kitchen wares <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t think this village lacked basic necessities like this.. I can probably get you a ladle for twenty ryo give or take.&#34;</font> he informs, quickly recalling the market price of those utensils.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) comes over and joins for a while, taking a seat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Still smells like piss
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) would cross her arms behind her back and and took afew paces closer as she gave her first offfer. 

<font color = white>&#34;I was thinking 50 ryo as a down payment. with 50% Interest on the final payment. Practically robbing me blind Oji-san.&#34;</font> she said stopping and see if the mask of being senile fell at that. 

Afterall....what merchant let age get in the way of profits?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) yells: 5 ryo for a... ladle!? I just told you it's 20! I am too old for you to scam brat!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) clearly couldn't hear everything this time too</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Some things neva change
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (bro, we are both too old to not know each other since Akihabara is so small
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Wu (The senile old man-Expami) OOCs: (we need to share names :sob:
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) scoffed, he was driving a hard bargin. She was hoping to buy the expensive sake tonight. 

<font color = white>&#34;Very well....100 Ryo down. For a Sword, nothing named mind you. But sufficent to cut down rats or the poor.&#34;</font> even as her words had ended, she had drew closer to the man. Her firey gaze locked to him and not wandering mindlessly up at the clouds or at a book. 

<font color = white>&#34;This deal to get me armed will go down in writing of course. Papiyas Niwa always recalls those who help her.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) raises an eyebrow out of confusion..
<font color = white>&#34;Why are you giving me 100 ryo for a ladle!? I told you it&#39;s 20!&#34;</font> he repeats <font color = white>&#34;Is this some kind of new age Iwagakure&#39;s scam!?&#34;</font> he takes one step back, still unable to correctly hear the young woman in front of him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) squints, <font color = white>&#34; Hey baldie! What er you doing here?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) was now before the old man. She was now clearly furious at this game. <font color = white>&#34;I said nothing about a ladle&#34;</font> she spat out before taking a deep breath. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am offering you all the ryo I have on me as a down payment for a Katana. This is the third and final time I shall repeat myself. Less I am the fool.&#34;</font> She reached out her gloved hand, tensed and clearly ready to slap something should the word ladle be brought up again

<font color = white>&#34;Do we have a deal?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) asks: Deal?
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Red hair is the sign of a harlot...but you wouldn't know anything about hair! "heh"
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: .....

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) finally hears what the woman had to say, though her attitude wasn&#39;t very appreciated.
<font color = white>&#34;Katana? Why didn&#39;t you say that earlier!?&#34;</font> he clicks his tongue <font color = white>&#34;Making me waste my time..&#34;</font> he mumbles to himself, only to inform the rude girl <font color = white>&#34;Lass, you won&#39;t find any blade from Akihabara for quite a while! The supply chain has slowed down and it will affect sales for the next couple of months! So forget katanas!&#34;</font>

He shakes his head, beside, women were better with a ladle in hand rather than a sword.. though he would keep that opinion to himself, he knew that recently some weird movement called womanism was gaining popularity..</font></font></font>

She spun then. <font color = white>&#34;Old dullards here to leer at women. I will be sure to let everyone I meet know to not buy from you or your equally bald friend.&#34;</font> she spat in the direction of the other one who had nothing to say but complaints.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) pulls his heaven bound gaze down to the earth. <font color = white>&#34;Hello, Shuye.&#34;</font>, he greets gentley.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Did you find any good books?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shook his head ever so slightly as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;Nothing on Xing.&#34;</font>
All his time at the library and all he&#39;d come to learn within this particular study was that the village had a severe lack of information surrounding foreign languages.
     Though, he didn&#39;t fault them. Books of the nature seemed to pale in comparison to those focused around Shinobi forefronts needs such as combat, tactical and medical guides. 

    <i><font color = white>&#34;Perhaps they were more important.&#34;</font></i> - he thought, dull eyes seeming to peer into the ethereal realm between both him and Shyue as his mind began to race.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) seemed briefly and subtly surprised, based off the widening and then narrowing of her eyes. She tried to remember if there were any books at home she could give him.

<font color = white>&#34;No luck learning a new language, then. There&#39;s a saying -- Rù xiāng suí sú.&#34;</font> The shift to a harsher, tonal language was jarring. <font color = white>&#34;When entering a village, follow its customs.&#34;</font>

Her people, few as they were, had taken that to heart.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) finds his focus pulled back in once more amongst the girl&#39;s shift into a different, natural tongue only to shift back into the one&#39;s he&#39;d come to know seemlessly.
    <font color = white>&#34;Mm..&#34;</font> - He seems to think for a moment, his eyes drifting toward her feet.

 <font color = white>&#34;Why are you here?&#34;</font>, he questions.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) tucked her hands into her sleeves, letting her almost minty green sleeves hang on either side. <font color = white>&#34;My clan lost their home. My dad says that the entire tribe travelled east until the land ended, and then built sailing ships and continued east until they found land again. Then...&#34;</font> She seemed a little unsure to continue, remembering how some of the other children had spoke about the shogunate, and about the previous kage--

<font color = white>&#34;...I don&#39;t really remember much, since I was so young. But my tribe met the shogun. We moved in here, to Iwagakure. My mom was...&#34;</font> more hesitation. <font color = white>&#34;...a chosen servant of the shogun, and he settled us here. But the duel of fates is cruel, so after my youngest sibling, she was--&#34;</font>

A moment was taken to remeasure her emotions, and settle them <font color = white>&#34;--released from her burden. Wán bì guī zhào.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) ears gave lifeless, near robotic analysis in the face of Shyue's rather obvious deterents from certain parts of her story. Upon her concluding her origin he continued to stare at the ground bellow her for a moment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) Then, back to the ground.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Are you lying?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) quirked a brow.

<font color = white>&#34;Why would I?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm not sure.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) stepped forward.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you want me to be lying?&#34;</font> She questioned.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crouched down, leveling herself with him. She let a moment of silence linger.

<font color = white>&#34;Do you have any questions?&#34;</font> She offered. <font color = white>&#34;If there is no book, at least I can be a primary source.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) blinks for a moment, a dreamy haze overtaking his pupils as he began ot think.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: What is your goal here?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I want to become the greatest medical shinobi to ever live. It's a humble goal.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Why?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: What is your route?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned, returning to the most natural expression she seemed to wear-- a scowl. This one is less directed. Internal. Her joke didn&#39;t seem to land. Finally, she seemed to come up with her answer.

<font color = white>&#34;I have no enemy except death. Therefore, I will deny it any victim, at every opportunity. I will slight it in every way I can. It took something important from me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes widen even so slightly as she spoken. She..

   <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s a beautiful thing.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) would smile from ear to ear; a rare sight. Even her teeth were visible, however briefly before she regathered her composure.

<font color = white>&#34;I have to be strong for my little siblings.&#34;</font> Her dad was -- kind, but broken. Shuye had to at once be a mother and a sister to her siblings, lest they grow up to be idiots and get themselves hurt. It left little time for being young and playful. <font color = white>&#34;So... I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to make friends.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I lost.. I got jumped by the six armed girl and her cousin

<font color = white>&#34;I typically am the one who has to say hello first.&#34;</font> Did that mean you weren&#39;t popular? Shuye wasn&#39;t entirely sure, but it felt like it was true. The difference between being wanted and being tolerated could be subtle at times.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would raise up from her crawling position and placed her hands on her hips...her judo kimono fluttering before its motion..stopped.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) walkd to the center and bowed down respectfully for a few seconds, before standing up and getting into a better fighting stance compared to last time.

Then it was her biggest nightmare.

<i>shhhhaaa...booshhh!</i>

the smoke left the sides...however it seemed to be...vanish a moment later. When they tried to move..they would notice that they would feel..disoriented...a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;perfect...i will begin the lecture now....&#34;</font> 

She paused..

<font color = white>&#34;you see..in combat...there are things called..mm..ailments that might cause your movement to be hindered...in this case..you were hit with light poisen that targets your motor functions..&#34;</font>

There was a breif pause once more before she continued. She then held up her  herbalist badge..mhm..</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) stepped on the green tile completely unaware of what was going to happen.

<font color = white>&#34;Wha...whaaat? I can see..uh...&#34;</font> she looked at Koume with a very dumb-looking face.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;dont worry..the disorienting as you might think feels long will go away quickly as your adrenaline kicks in..to detur..the effects of the poisen&#34;</font>

She paused...as she help up her hand and in a poof of smoke...a cup of juice appeared.

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: for problem solving

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was starting to see things no one else could, the world was shaped at her will and her will was shaped by her world&#39;s.

<font color = white>&#34;...wah...&#34;</font>

Subconciously she managed to grab the cup of juice and take a sip of it - her eyes went back to normal and all the trippy stuff was gone. Fubuki was back to standing on the green tile, or rather she realized she stood on it the whole time.

<font color = white>&#34;Woah...so how does the problem solving work? D-do we constantly get drugged in this game?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She paused for a moment as she reached into her judo cloak and took out a piece of paper to read. Her gaze skimmed through it before she found the passage she was looking for.

<font color = white>&#34;however it only lasts for a short while and....and be cooled with a water source....where that water source may come from..in a village like our own?...im not sure...so be careful of this...mhm...&#34;</font>

==================== katon burn perk ==================
Name: 

Incendiary Flame  

Desc:

 This character has mastered the art of sticky flame. By carefully molding their chakra, they produce fire from a chakra fuel that is adhesive and sticks to their target once they are struck. This makes it very difficult to remove and the fire will continue burning unless the victim employs precious seconds putting out the flames. 

Note:

Those struck by a fire technique continue to burn for petty injury for two turns. The victim may use their offensive action to put it out or use a water source of medium size or above.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) It was frankly amazing that Fubuki somehow didn&#39;t suspect anything when stepping onto the red tile, only when her foot landed on it did she understand the gravity of the situation. A part of her soul began crying for help.

<font color = white>&#34;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!&#34;</font>

Her whole body was surrounded by fire! Her hair and skin got completely ruined and obviously she was burning everywhere. It wasn&#39;t much fire but it was enough to really scare her. While Koume spoke, Fubuki fell to the ground and started rolling around - when she was thrown a wet towel she&#39;d turn into a flaming burrito for a few seconds, rolling with it. Then she fire was put out.

Fubuki slowly stood up and exhaled, she grabbed the other towel and started cleaning herself. <font color = white>&#34;Koume...this is...totally great training, yeah...&#34;</font> she said in pain.

It was then it ended...however they would notice that the effects they suffered were worse that the poisen. But would last the less time than the poisen she used.

<font color = white>&#34;You would notice this is a lightning attack this time...these cost..an effect of electrocution....mm..no..a nervous system..error.i believe its called. It messes with your motor functions to a further degree and also messes with a casters handseal speed..not to meantion your how fast you move across the field...&#34;</font>

She paused as she laughed a bit akwardly..while placing her hands on her hips.

<font color = white>&#34;then theres the fact that you can also..stop a persons movement completely...if i remeber correctly from the stories ive heard...if hit directly with a technique itself.&#34;</font>

=========== more info below of the status aliment below ===========

Name:

Numbing Joltage  

Desc:

This character has developed the ability to sustain an electrical current that courses through the body of their victim if they are unfortunate enough to be struck by a lightning technique. The current is delivered as a numbing jolt of electricity that stuns the victim, slowing their reaction times considerably. 

Note:

Those struck by an electrifying lightning technique lose two steps of speed, agility, hand seal tempo, and tile movement until the end of their next turn.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) Perhaps it was evil, or perhaps it was kind, but at least she wouldn&#39;t see what was coming this time. After all it was much easier to instantly feel pain than to see it about to hit her even if it was for a split second.

Fubuki didn&#39;t have time to react to the lightning which shocked her whole body, spiking up her hair and making her stand up completely. When the shock was over everyone nearby could smell the girl was a bit burnt, right before falling to the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I-I-I-.---I---II....IIII...&#34;</font> the nervous shock had  been so severe she couldn&#39;t even speak, Fubuki was a frozen statue on the floor except for the occassional twitch. However this lasted only a few seconds before she stood up and regained her movement.

<font color = white>&#34;I...I&#39;m alive...&#34;</font> she looked at her hands in amazement. She had no idea training could get so rough.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: I-is that it?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) asks: What's your name even?
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) asks: My name is Kuro, just Kuro. And yours?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would laugh a bit before shaking her head meaning no.

<font color = white>&#34;u-unfortunately not..theres about...one more you might have to suffer through...before we go into..the next section.&#34;</font>

She paused.

<font color = white>&#34;b-but i dont really have a suiton tile..so your lucky mhm!..&#34;</font> With a light wink..she found herself continueing there after. <font color = white>&#34; For suiton..it mostly messes with your movement across the field...if i remeber correctly...same with fuuton....with the case it knocks you back....so your all fine on that front&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: if i had something to add..hmm..it would be to teach you about...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s eyes widened, her soul was ready to die as soon as Koume mentioned there was one more tile to go. But thankfully the game was still in early access and the suiton tile hadn&#39;t been added, so she sighed out of happiness and laid on the floor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m free...from the pain--&#34;</font>

And then the obstacle course turned into the other one.

<font color = white>&#34;...Fuck.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would poof away her previous course and summoned a new one into existance. Upon returning...she looked to the yellow mushroom.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would hold up training shuriken for them to take!

<font color = white>&#34; throw this at the mushroom behind you&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (br question, do shurikens use agility or strength for its speed)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Koume(The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) OOCs: [hmm agility i think..]

<br><font color=green>*Chirithy (The purple-haired boy-Shikai-Demon) says: Hello, everyone!~
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: Sorry, I'm Tanaka.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) grabbed the shuriken and turned around - she saw one of those toads again.

<font color = white>&#34;NOT YOU.&#34;</font>

She immediately threw the shuriken towards the mushroom, hitting it on its big dumb-looking head. Fubuki had a lot of resentment for those things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Oh is she playing the game again?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: I assume only fubuki gets to play
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) walks by the eastern route of the village, moving nearer to Raku.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) asks: Who's that?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Missed all the fun.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) raised her hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Help.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) waved at Yurei.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) says: Nice to meet you Tanaka.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) gives a wide closed-mouth smile to Fubiki.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) waved at Yurei before she got tortured once more on this lesson.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuda, Tanaka (The aqua-eyed teen-12 year old blind girl) says: Yeah, nice to meet you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) continued to stare into the ethers, no telling where his mind had carried him in all his idle <i>'meditation'</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) was ignored--

<font color = white>&#34;See, Raku? Not popular.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) actually smiled at Shuye, it was still early for the author.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) omit</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) didn't wave at Yurei because FUCK him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would hold up a hand to cover her mouth! 

She tried to hide the fact she was giggling at...the resentment she saw. They were off duty..so it should be..f-fine..she hoped.

====================== mushroom! =============

The yellow mushroom found themselves being attacked..and moved forwards to try and attack them before the shuriken hit their body!...however it..the shuriken hit their squishy body before they collaped on the ground to play dead!

<i>ploop!!!</i>
=====================================

<font color = white>&#34; you see...y-you see...a-ahem..you see...the reason why the mushroom couldnt counter you is because of they way the order of attacks work in this world. Perhaps made this way by the shogan himself. &#34;</font> She found herself..pausing breifly..before speaking once more.

<font color = white>&#34;Shurikenjutsu happens..first...and taijutsu happened after it mhm...however it expands to something more...as after a bit of experimentation and a few lost lifes of our iwagakurian shinobi...we have a detailed list..to make it easier for the newer generation&#34;</font>

Reaching into her pocket...she held up a piece of paper for them to read off of.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) smirked when the shuriken had been thrown, and then her expression turned into dread and horror as the mushroom was running at her.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh, I see.&#34;</font> She grabbed the piece of paper and read it for a bit before handing it back. <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, that was nice and uhh...not torture, like earlier.&#34;</font> Fubuki&#39;s body still had burn marks.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Swords will come and go.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: You also want to own a sword?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had been spaced out staring at the water and didn&#39;t realize Shuye approached him. Spacing back in he spins around to continue talking to her without being rude.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, with they&#39;d actually ever come though. They&#39;re like several bajillion ryo...&#34;</font>

He then looks to Fubuki and shrugs,

<font color = white>&#34;I just wanted to buy something shiny to be honest.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. Well, I'm only five hundred ryo short for a katana, thanks to Hana.

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Oh, a friend I met. She gave me money.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Wish my friends would give me money...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: At least you have friends. That is a different sort of wealth.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) ears quirk up at the sound of &#39;buy something shiny&#39;.

With a overdramatic backflip from the arena, she lands next to the red-haired boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Well let me show you my wares!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed.

Her hands came together, a loud clap echoing out, before she withdraws her hands apart towards either side of her. As her hands stretched out, shimmering pink crystals formed, making unique patterns along the way until she&#39;d finally reached as far as she could.
 <font color = white>&#34;Just fifty Ryo and I&#39;ll make a shiny object of your choice!&#34;</font>

Was she attempting to scam children? Yes. Did she care? Absolutely not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) is a little too wise-- or perhaps, more accurately, a little too jaded, to fall for this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) sloooowly turns to face Kitsumi. Clearly not having forgotten how quick she was to pawn the work of repairing the gate and stairs off on literally anyone else. His eyes narrow, staring at her for a moment. However he&#39;s immediately distracted by the crystals. His brain was smooth and the rocks were pretty.

<font color = white>&#34;A shiny object of my choice?! Out of crystal right? That&#39;d be awesome...&#34;</font>

He cups his chin in his hand and begins pondering what to ask for. Eventually snapping his fingers and holding out fifty ryo to the Shingen.

<font color = white>&#34;I want a crystal monkey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hideo, you want money yet you spend it on this?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Just... make him a mirror...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: What's the point of having money if I don't spend it- Shuye are you suggesting I'm a monkey?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But you're always complaining about money, maybe save a little first...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) scowled externally, and smiled internally. Silence and eye contact is the answer.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm not *complaining* about money! I just *want* money. There's a difference!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. I guess then, fair enough.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And I want money so that I can spend it! Spending money makes me feel better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) continued flipping through his book.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What do you want to spend it on though? Just anything?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean, anything that's cool yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Liiiike a crystal monkey!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Should have got a rock-candy monkey.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I don't think she can make rock-candy... But that does sound awesome!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) gave a nod in response before clasping her hands together once again. All the crystals she&#39;d formed turned into nothing but sparkles in the air as her hands met.
 <font color = white>&#34;Of course!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed once again, the prospect of profit clearly warranting more energy out of the normally aloof girl.

As her hands began pulling apart, a Curious George-esque monkey formed within her palms, shimmering against the sunlight. Little by little it came together, its slightly larger than body head forming first, followed by its body and limbs, until finally she added a little curved tail at the end.

Extending her hand out, she offered the piece to the boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now, my crystals are resistant to near everything in such compact form, so breaking it should be hard!... UnlessIdiebutthenwe&#39;reallscrewed.&#34;</font>, she finished with a bright smile.</font></font></font>
