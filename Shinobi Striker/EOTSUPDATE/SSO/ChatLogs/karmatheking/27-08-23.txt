He paused to give her time to give her name, before continueing

<font color = white>&#34;You gave the cloesest to the right answer.&#34;</font>

He nodded to the girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;Chakra is essential to even the most basic technique; it is the moulding of the physical energy present in every cell of the body and the spiritual energy gained from exercise and experience. Most shinobi utilize handsigns to utlize proper techniques and guide your chakra.&#34;</font>

He gave an impromptu lesson on the very very basics.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) climbs out, having been zoned all this time! <font color = white>&#34;Sure. Here I am!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) looked over to his side and then looked down at the smaller child who elbowed him. He&#39;d cock a brow before furrowing both of his brows. 

<font color = white>&#34;Is this the disrespect you show your hokage? To just elbow bump themwhen they are deep in thought?&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) turned to look towards the young girl casually make her way towards the lord Hokage and attempt to elbow bump him. A subtle shifting of himself and the single utilizeation of a handsign would place him betweem the pair in a flash of smoke, preventing her from doing so. 

<font color = white>&#34;Please show proper decorum when addressing and getting close to the lord hokage.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru(The captain-Karma_the_King) OOCs: (ah, you beat me too it, I wasn't gonna let her actually touch you )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) parted with a gentle sigh, the girl just wasn&#39;t getting it...! A hand raised, pressing to her chest respectfully.

<font color = white>&#34;Please forgive her doofy nature, Captain Akitaru. She&#39;s not quite accustomed. As said my name is Kurorama, of the Senju. My goal is to become a valuable asset of the village-- a pillar that strives to keep the Will of Fire burning. And, one day, if I may be so bold, I would wish to hold office as the Hokage.&#34;</font>

Sssspeeeaaaking of, said Kage had just appeared. Oh no, this was quite the audience.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) thinks: Of course one of MY clan would be able to partially answer my question. I expected better, but I'll forgive her for now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would side eye the senju as he wanted to stand inbtween the duo.The girl would burst into laughter.

<font color = white>&#34;Geesh I see you&#39;re going with the dull kage huh?Come on,I know you like to have a bit of fun.&#34;</font>they would nudgethe hokage once more again.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) Huh. Wait. Captain?! Oh-- This guy. This guy must be someone important. Whoops!

She straightened her posture and stood at attention-- wait. He was no longer standing here. He was.. down the road now?! Fast. Well, for now, she just continued standing stiff as a wooden plank, not saying a word! Observing the events play out. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) didn&#39;t even blink, as the girl attempted to once more touch the hokage, he moved swiftly, grabbing her by the shoulder and waist and, almost artisticly, tossing her over the wall into the water. His face remained impartial and stoic, never once betraying emotion. His voice was much the same as he spoke. 

<font color = white>&#34;You will not be warned a third time. Do not attempt to touch the lord Hokage without his express consent.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) nods eight times in the span of one second. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would sigh at the senju as they some how became the voice for the kage.

<font color = white>&#34;Since your hand is there mind giving me a rub?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) whispers faintly.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) showed a smirk as he turned to the two. 

<font color = white>&#34;Ah.. its okay, they are young afterall. Not many know the correct ways of decorum when addressing their superious. It will need to be taught in the academy.&#34;</font> The man slightly tilted his head back as his chin was raised, lowering his gaze onto the young Uchiha more. 

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me child, what is your name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) removed himself from the situation at that point, the lord Hokage now had this handled. His job had been completed in a manner approptiate his station. 

<font color = white>&#34;Of course, Lord Hokage&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) parted with a quiet &#39;Hemm&#39;, and tried to nudge the blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Introduce yourself.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) thinks: I'm surprised Kurorama didn't seem to realize who I was. . .Interesting.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a06d87>Senju, Kumirama (The crimson eyed gambler-Demon_Kitty101) would frown once seeing that the older senju didn&#39;t bless her with an awsome back rub.

<font color = white>&#34;My name is Senju Kumirama,pleasure to meet you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) thinks: One one MINE!?
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) thinks: I'll find her parents and have them scoled. . .How could one of MY clan behave in such a way.
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) thinks: Scolded** 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) had exactly zero refined etiquette skills. Naturally. She&#39;s has yet to even enter the Academy. Addressing individuals of note was beyond her limited skill range. But! She was able to follow helpful instructions, at the very least. 

A nudge and direction was just what she needed!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Hanako. I&#39;m, uh.. planning to join the Academy soon? Your.. <i>Captainship</i>?&#34;</font> She strained the last word together, having zero idea how to work with titles beyond what she&#39;s seen in novels about Lords. Surely that&#39;s how all titles worked, right? Lord equals Lordship! 

<font color = white>&#34;I, uh, look forward to learning!&#34;</font> She folds her hands at her waist and gauged their expression. Searching for any tells that she&#39;s scuffed up this introduction! </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcccc>Kaguya, Koppun (The hokage-Taigodwushu) nodded his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;Interesting, I mistook you for an Uchiha. Your clans seem to have more and more similiar features with every passing generation. Noted. Senju Kumirama, ill be sure to have the Academy Sensei properly train you in your decorum.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Captain, please be sure that this one specifically is made an example of infront of the class. I will not have soldier in Konoha&#39;s army that do not know proper decorum.

He nodded to the girl and the other senju standing beside her, giving them both a chance to say something in response. His head turned to bow towards the Hokage and nod. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll let the teachers know. Thank you for her oppertunity to learn, Lord Hokage.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) didn't let his emotion show this was a test.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) dismissed the notion of family entirely-- in her mind, she hadn&#39;t yet earned the right to address him with familial tone.

<font color = white>&#34;Yes, Commander Senju.&#34;</font>

Not that she usually went first name-basis with people she just met to begin with.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s an honour to finally make acquaintance with you. If you intend to teach at the academy, I&#39;d hope for your guidance.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) let only the slightest hint of a smile creep through upon his face, before it vanished. It was only for a blink, it might even be possiable that she&#39;d missed it, but a single nod of his head is given. 

<font color = white>&#34;I see. I don&#39;t plan to teach, I have other tasks I&#39;ll be handleing, but, if you run into a question you need answered?&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) dipped into a gentle bow at that! It only lasted as long as she spoke, though.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be sure to spend it wisely. I&#39;m certain there are things that only a Senju can assist with.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: But they weren't nothing!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I would suggest, setting it up with jabs. Haymakers like that can be easily telegraphed.

<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Not to mention they are wild, leaving you opened after throwing them out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) shrugged, as the thought of a spar ending due to such a sloppy display made him inwardly cringe. 

<font color = white>&#34;Whom are you? Whom did you defeat?&#34;</font>

A black notebook is produced from seemingly nowhere.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Maybe that's why I got his so much.~
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Jabs are quick, if they land they give your body a sense of range.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) never missed an opportunity to shout her name to the Heavens above.
