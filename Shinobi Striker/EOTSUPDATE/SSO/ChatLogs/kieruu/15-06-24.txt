<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Sogeki entered the arena, the atmosphere seemed to bend slightly to accommodate his presence. His stride was purposeful, each step echoing with a quiet confidence that demanded attention. The onlookers, a mix of curious students and seasoned shinobi, instinctively parted to make way for him, sensing the aura of determination and power that surrounded him.

His cloak billowed behind him, adding to his imposing figure, and his icy gaze swept across the arena, taking in every detail with a keen awareness. The sinister smirk on his face played at the corners of his lips, a subtle promise of impending action and calculated moves.

With a deliberate motion, Sogeki cracked his knuckles one by one, the sound echoing faintly in the silence. It was a gesture of readiness, a physical manifestation of the energy coursing through him. His eyes narrowed slightly, focusing on the challengers gathered in the arena, each one a potential obstacle to overcome.

A low murmur of anticipation rippled through the crowd as they sensed the imminent clash of wills. Some regarded him with apprehension, others with curiosity, but all acknowledged his presence with a mixture of respect and wariness.

Without a word, Sogeki positioned himself at the center of the arena, his stance firm and balanced. He exuded an aura of dominance and readiness, a silent challenge to anyone bold enough to face him. The smirk on his face widened imperceptibly as he awaited the beginning of the tournament, eager to prove his strength and assert his place at the top.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki methodically paces towards Higane, the air thickens with oppressive tension. His every step echoes with quiet menace, each footfall calculated and deliberate. The onlookers, usually boisterous and lively, fall into an uneasy silence as they witness the unfolding scene.

Sogeki's demeanor is chillingly calm, his eyes narrowed into icy slits that seem to pierce through the very soul of anyone who dares to meet his gaze. His presence exudes an aura of impending danger, like a predator stalking its prey with unwavering focus.

The sound of his footsteps reverberates ominously in the arena, setting off a cascade of nervous whispers among the spectators. Some shift uncomfortably, their instincts screaming at them to flee from the palpable threat emanating from Sogeki.

Higane, standing firm in the face of this approaching storm, can feel the weight of Sogeki's gaze bearing down on him like a heavy yoke. A cold sweat breaks out on his brow as he realizes the magnitude of the challenge before him.

With each passing moment, Sogeki closes the distance with a deliberate slowness that only heightens the tension in the air. His movements are fluid yet controlled, like a coiled serpent ready to strike at any moment.

Finally, he stands mere paces away from Higane. Sogeki's lips curl into a menacing smirk, devoid of warmth, a harbinger of impending turmoil and ruthless determination.

The arena falls into an eerie silence, anticipation hanging thick in the air like a suffocating fog. All eyes are fixed on Sogeki and Higane, two forces on a collision course destined to unleash chaos and turmoil upon the arena floor.</font></font></font>

He pivots smoothly, evading Higane&#39;s makeshift senbon with a sidestep that seems almost effortless. The wooden needles whistle past him harmlessly, grazing the air where he had stood just moments before.

A dark glint flashes in Sogeki&#39;s eyes as he retrieves a pair of wooden kunai from his own kit with a fluid motion. His expression remains stoic, but a simmering intensity radiates from him, an unsettling aura that seems to pulse with anticipation.

He takes a deliberate step forward, closing the distance between them with a predator&#39;s grace. The arena around them seems to hold its breath, the tension thickening with each passing second.

Sogeki moves decisively, launching one of the wooden kunai towards Higane. It cuts through the air with precision, a silent declaration of his intent and skill. The blade&#39;s trajectory is aimed to test her reflexes, a challenge laid down in the quiet confrontation unfolding between them.

<i>Woosh!</i> The kunai whistles past her long black hair as she ducks bellow it, entering a low stance and releasing a new set of senbon at her oponent with a swift step backwards. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. three left.&#34;</font> She mumbled as her fingers fidget with her shinobi kit.

Her determination and adaptability are evident as she enters a low stance, preparing her next move with a swift step backwards. He senses her calculating gaze and the tension in the air thickens as she readies her next set of senbon.

Moving with controlled aggression, Sogeki closes the distance between them with deliberate steps. He weaves and sidesteps, evading the incoming senbon with fluid movements that speak of honed skill and instinct. Each step he takes is purposeful, a silent dance of anticipation and readiness.

His focus remains locked on Higane, studying her movements and adjusting his strategy accordingly. Sogeki doesn&#39;t rush into action just yet, opting instead to observe and assess his opponent&#39;s tactics. His expression is unreadable, a mask of calm amidst the flurry of movement and tension surrounding them.

As Higane mutters to herself about her remaining senbon, Sogeki&#39;s smirk returns briefly, a silent acknowledgment of the challenge she presents. He knows this won&#39;t be an easy match, but that only fuels his determination to prove his strength and skill in the unfolding confrontation.

Her strategy of shoot and evade challenges him to adapt and respond with equal precision. The senbon fly towards him, propelled by her practiced technique, but Sogeki remains calm amidst the storm of needles.

He smirks faintly at her taunt, a glint of amusement dancing in his eyes. His steps are measured and deliberate as he continues to close the distance between them. Evading the projectiles with deft movements, he waits patiently, timing his response with calculated precision.

As the last senbon whizzes past him, Sogeki seizes the moment. With a sudden burst of speed and agility, he launches himself towards Higane. His movements are swift and decisive, closing the gap between them in a heartbeat. His hands blur as he prepares to strike, ready to test her defenses and assert his dominance in the arena.

Small beads of sweat form behind the girls nape.. <font color = white>&#34;Ah shit, last two huh..&#34;</font> She whimpered as she launched her second to last set of senbon at Sogeki.

The moment it was released from her flicked wrist, Higane&#39;s eyes narrowed realizing that this would be a direct <i>hit!</i>

His tactical adjustment had cost him footing, and in that moment of vulnerability, he saw Higane&#39;s senbon closing in.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn,&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath, his eyes narrowing with determination. Swiftly drawing one of his remaining sets of senbon from his own kit, he thrust them forward in a calculated clash of wood against wood, intercepting Higane&#39;s projectiles with precision.

The clash echoed through the arena, the sound of wood meeting wood reverberating in the tense silence. Sogeki held his ground, his movements deliberate and controlled as he advanced slowly. His focus intensified, a silent determination radiating from him despite the setback.

With each measured step forward, Sogeki recalibrated his strategy. He needed to close the distance effectively, relying on his remaining weaponry and his own skills to turn the tide in his favor. His eyes locked on Higane, calculating his next move as he prepared to engage with renewed resolve.

<font color = white>&#34;Gah!&#34;</font> Sogeki grunted through clenched teeth, feeling the sting of the senbon piercing his flesh. He quickly pulled it out with a swift motion, blood trickling down his arm. Ignoring the pain, he maintained his steady advance towards Higane.

His gaze locked onto her, his expression hardening with determination. The injury fueled his fighting spirit rather than weakening it. With a determined grunt, Sogeki pushed through the discomfort, his movements fluid and focused.

Closing the gap with unwavering resolve, he pressed forward despite the injury, ready to meet Higane&#39;s next move head-on. His mind raced with strategies, adapting to the evolving dynamics of their confrontation. Sogeki knew that every moment counted now, and he was determined to prove his strength and resilience in the face of adversity.

Let&#39;s do it!&#34;</font> She shouted as the wooden needle flew across the makeshift arena.

The moment the needle is released, Higane gets low to the ground, widening her stance into a peculiar one.. Her right leg trails behind her as her left knee bends ahead her arms extend out in opposite directons.

<font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font> She shoute with vigor.

Was this a bluff?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s relentless advance halts abruptly as he sees Higane&#39;s final set of senbon hurtling towards him. His eyes narrow with determination as he prepares to intercept or evade the incoming projectiles. However, just before he can react, Higane&#39;s voice rings out with unexpected intensity, shouting <font color = white>&#34;Jyuuken!&#34;</font>

Confusion flickers across Sogeki&#39;s face for a moment. He doesn&#39;t recognize the term or understand its significance, but he senses the conviction in Higane&#39;s voice. Ignoring the unfamiliarity, he refocuses on the immediate threat of the senbon heading his way.

With a swift sidestep and a flick of his wrist, Sogeki manages to deflect some of the senbon, but one grazes his shoulder, drawing a sharp intake of breath from him. He winces at the pain but doesn&#39;t falter. His mind races, recalibrating his approach as he continues his determined advance towards Higane.

His strategy remains unchanged: assert dominance, prove his strength, and seize control of the confrontation. The unfamiliar technique Higane mentioned is momentarily set aside in his mind as he readies himself for the next exchange, focused on the immediate challenge before him.

He places hands within his pockets before smirking. He watches his two clansmen spar looking at the form of their Jyuuken as he had yet to really train with the clans Taijutsu style.

'Might as well get a good idea of the foot work...', he thought.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s smile slowly creeps up her face as she snickers outloud.. <font color = white>&#34;Whats wrong?! Not closing in anymore! You&#39;re in range!&#34;</font>

The young girl holds her stance, and remains still. Her resolve steadfast. It could have all ended here.. But Sogeki&#39;s attitude begun to irritate her.. slowly wilting away her patience. <font color = white>&#34;You talk so high and mighty, but you don&#39;t understand what its like to be revered! What it&#39;s truly like to be thought of as an elite...&#34;</font> She stopped herself halfway..

Her teeth audibly grit making a low grinding sound. <font color = white>&#34;The pressure... the damn pressure..&#34;</font> She concluded, as her stance seemed to waiver and almost crumble.. no longer did she look as agile and intimidating.
