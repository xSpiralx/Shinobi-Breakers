<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) nods-- mostly to herself.

     <font color = white>&#34;You made it sound like people don&#39;t really want to talk to you. That and you talk kind of..&#34;</font>

Her free hand idly moves as she searches for the word.

<font color = white>&#34;Proper?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: I don't know... Didn't Najiro just run your pockets?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: he accepted a dice game,so did i
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Don't worry about another Shinobis pockets.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both parties agree to it.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: But i stay with Ryo just so you know.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stretches his hand back and forth, massaging out the pain. <font color = white>&#34;Couldn&#39;t be me... That&#39;s all I&#39;m saying.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (lol the irony of the amount of bullying Asa's taken mixed witht he fact he's currently shoeless
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Aren't you the one being thrown at a lake,got a wegie by a construction worker,and got your hand broken by trying to hit the croutch of said guy
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Did you see that guy?  He was a unit...
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If im you? i might watch my words from now on
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I had a lapse in judgment. Won't happen again.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I was the one thrown in the lake.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: But it seems yall are fine over here so im heading to the cafe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) pursed his lips, looking at Najiro through slitted eyes. <font color = white>&#34;Naji, I&#39;m the biggest hater. I won&#39;t lower my tone because that guy was bricked up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) waves to the group before turning to depart</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) waved as the cabbage reeking individual left.

     <font color = white>&#34;Take care.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Hana and simply say

<font color = white>&#34;More of most people sleep,and i read alot.But anyway,i won&#39;t ask anymore questions,if thats what you want.&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (to react?
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Oh. I need to warn that guy about the shoe eating sharks.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) yells: Bill!!
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Huh
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) caught up to him, the sound of his soles plopping the ground as he did so. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve been trying to tell you all day, but you&#39;ve been busy. That shark guy, what&#39;s his name...&#34;</font> He pondered for a moment, tapping his temply. <font color = white>&#34;Not important. The shark guy eats shoes I think. Watch out for him! Not that I care if he eats YOUR belongings.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I know I had them when we were training Suimen and he was there. Now they're gone.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) blinks, not having expected such a thing from the stern boy as he reached for his pouch.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, thanks for the heads up.&#34;</font>
They said, resting a hand on the shoes he had stolen from the boy as it seemed the blame got shifted to one of the Shark clan.
<font color = white>&#34;When i see them i&#39;ll ask them about your shoes&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stuck his hands behind his head, frowning. <font color = white>&#34;Nah, it&#39;s okay. Shoes come and go. Those were just special. One of a kind, in fact. I can&#39;t fault them for it. Probably thought it was a fish... I&#39;ll get them back someday.&#34;</font>

He pushed a rock with his foot. <font color = white>&#34;If you see them though, let me know. I&#39;ll make sure to go easy on you if we ever spar.&#34;</font> He cracked a small smile. <font color = white>&#34;Maybe when my hand&#39;s better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (intention is to convey appreciation by "going easy"
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) chuckled and wave to the Stern boy as they departed</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) folds her arms across her chest. Her head tilts as she follows the boy&#39;s words. Eventually, she--

     <font color = white>&#34;You say a lot of words..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Indeed!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Learn t'condense 'em!
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: To put it in a simple manner,he hates how i didn't continued the fight and pursuit untill one of us loses.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And sees my actions as being a coward.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Blah blah blah blah blah.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Put simply, screw what other people say - jus' do you, man.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: The Shark has a point.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Jinbeisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do you think i don't know this? Im not bothered by their words,im simply dissapointed by their behavior
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I will call you Jinby.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) walked up to the still-gathered group and overheard the end of the conversation. He frowned, his brow furrowing. <font color = white>&#34;You have a bad opinion of me for wanting you to do better? Hm...&#34;</font> Asa shrugged, putting his hands in his pockets. <font color = white>&#34;So be it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Jinbei or Jinby, I don't care which!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I like Jinby better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, raising a finger as she blurts out--

     <font color = white>&#34;Beisame!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Beisame.. Sure.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Kfhfhfh... Beisame has a ring to it.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its the fact how you acted.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And what you faced as consequences today.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: I am who I am.
<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) says: Do you take me to be ashamed of what happened today? Embarrasses, maybe, Not ashamed. Every defeat is a lesson.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (embarrassed*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) I thought Jinby was pretty good...
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his chin. Repeating the name to himself multiple times. A multitude of names he would need to grow attached too.
     <font color = white>&#34;Jus&#39; call me whatever y&#39;like - so long as it&#39;s respectful - and I&#39;ll respond to it!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: So far 'Beisame' is in th'lead.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, you've got to include the 'same' part or thats just ignoring your family.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: hm..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Mhm, mhm. The 'Same' part is the most important bit.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Right! Exactly like I prefer 'Beisame', actually takes that factor into equation.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: And...why that part is so nessecary?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Wh-..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I think Jinby is the best.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (Shizuma is hoshigaki too ya know XD
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) turns, her brow narrowing at the boy&#39;s question. Her hand gestures towards Beisame-- mostly pointing towards the various visible shark features on his face.

     <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t tell?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (that hoshigaki from boruto
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Listen. Calling a Hoshigaki a name without 'same' is like calling a Senju a name without 'rama' , it's a bad omen.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: It'll ruin your karma.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will look at them both and say
<font color = white>&#34;Zama is also a name in their clan.Surprized nobody knows this&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: 'Rama is more relevant, though.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) nods, sagely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It's just the 'ama' part, isn't it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) nods in turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (*zuma
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm..
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Ame and Ama.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Im still going to call him, Jinby. Got it, sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Sharky feels like a slur, almost.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: It isn't?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm no rubber-ducky nor fuzzy plaything.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,what do you want to be your nickname
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I feel like they get a pass on account of the fact they're like... Small...
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I'd be pretty upset if someone called me 'Sharky'.. Kind of down plays the whole family.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: If it was anyone else it'd feel racially charged, but in this instance it feels like childlike innocence.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Oh shut your yapping, blondie.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmm, you may be right, cous'.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Sharky doesn't mind me calling him, Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: ....
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: okay..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Now it's gettin' weird.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Do your, Sharky?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: *you
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I don't feel th'need to repeat myself.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: i will go for a quick run across the village.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm not talking to you, Jinby.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm talking to Sharky.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: Keep up.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: So - my cousin?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: A.K.A., someone from my clan.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) dismissively waved her hand. Oddly enough, the comment didn&#39;t really have the same sting to it.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s just asking for one of them to get mad at you..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..just this group here.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: What does your clan have to do with knowing your name?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Or nickname rather? Nicknames are fun!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: What is this even about.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Nicknames for Hoshigaki.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I gave Jinby a nickname and someone said something about it being Ra-sh-a-ly charged.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I dont think they like me calling Sharky, Sharky....
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: But Sharky doesn't mind.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Uh-huh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....Anyway.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Well if they don't like it why not respect their wishes?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I care less for it anymore.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: Who tells a little girl her nicknames are racist?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: thats a boy
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..Is it?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: It?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yuki clan have very feminine males.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) steps forward. Her hand comes to her chin as she glances over them.

    <font color = white>&#34;I.. can&#39;t really tell.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: If it means anything.....I don't know any of you people names either.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Same, t'be fair.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Najiro. You need glasses my little shinobi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) loses their childlike innocense and glares at the profound blonde.

<font color = white>&#34;Who are you calling it, you hag!?&#34;</font>, they exclaim, their face puffing and arms crossing across their small body.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: That's a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Both of them are sisters i think
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: How dare you misgender me cabbage breathe!
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (OMIT)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) pointed at the two Yuki's</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ....thats definatly a boy
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Oh with the exception of cabage breath over there.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Amehara(The cold child-RashanTNS) OOCs: (inserts 2024 lesson on gender pronouns into naruto game)
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Both are boys infact.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello Bill.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And My name is Najiro,Rose.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Hello, Perfume lady.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) gave Bill the senju nod of approval.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Ah Najiro.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Little Girl tell Najiro to get his eyes checked.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: Mind carrying my bags?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) asks: Little girl?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;H-Hag?&#34;</font>

The insult causes a visible recoil from the girl. Her entire aura shrinks as she recalls the second conversation she had with this group. There was no way she--

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m not old! We&#39;re probably all the same age!&#34;</font> she shouts in protest.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Do it yourself
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm simply Jinbeisame, or as th'lady beside me called me, 'Beisame.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: They are not heavy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) points up at the older profound blonde. Their small frame still slightly dwarfed by the older child.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m 10. Your at least like...Like...16! You&#39;re ancient for a shinobi!&#34;</font>, he exclaims.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: And i'm Hannah Montana.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Who?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says:  Hey...can you tell him that you are a boy
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Everyone belives you are a girl.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) asks: Hannah's a Boy?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Who is even Hannah?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Points at that Cold child</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I'm a boy..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) walked forward and stood beside the two students.
<font color = white>&#34;Aye, Hana, you are too old to get into it here with this kid, especially on the new bridge.&#34;</font>
He tucked away his touch and placed a hand on top of the cold child&#39;s head.
<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be talking like that to people older than you, kid.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he would make his way over to stand next to the Cold child. Before looking towards the others. <font color = white>&#34;I can tell, But that might also be because...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hana,in their defense
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You do look...mature.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Not a hag but...that early puberty hit you hard.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) feels a hand grasp the top of his head. Quickly, he scurries to the side to remove the unrequested touch and stands next to his cousin.

<font color = white>&#34;You mind your business too grandpa.&#34;</font>, he said, before turning his attention to the others who seemed to be debating over his gender.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t even look like a girl. I&#39;m clearly a boy!&#34;</font>, he says.</font></font></font>

     <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only <i>thirteen</i>, smooth-bits! Don&#39;t get mad at me because you&#39;re stuck between a boy and a girl!&#34;</font>

She leans forward, an almost-visible spark of tension between the two shinobi. That was, well, until the cabbage-reeker stepped between them.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would move to stand next to his cousin. To be fair he himself looked far girlier than the other. But he wore traditional masculine clothes. That&#39;s probably what made him not be mistaken for a girl so often. He looks towards the other. <font color = white>&#34;Things could be far worse.&#34;</font>  He remarks with a little laugh, <font color = white>&#34;The real question is does our clan have any Girls, or will all the Hyuuga be too scared to check.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Like a Gatcha game.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) squinted their eyes at the cold child, a thick vein appearing on their forehead at the kid&#39;s words.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m only 13, you brat!&#34;</font>
Their hand shot into their pouch as they quickly lost their temper, not knowing why they tried to be the voice of reason when they had such a short fuse.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) brow twitched as the kid started making faces at them, and the veins on their forehead grew larger.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: To be honest, we should settle this with a game of 200, I'll hold the funds, too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) stops making faces and glares at Bill. The child-like jokes and aura instantly dissipating into an icy chill. His eyes would lock onto the cabbage haired elder child.

<font color = white>&#34;If you touch me, you&#39;ll regret it.&#34;</font>, he says, in a cold monotonous tone. His child-like immature visage being replaced with something much colder...Much more...sinister.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: ....
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) rubbed his hands together.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) locked eyes with the cold child as their aura shifted around them, and they felt a slight chill wash over them as they saw a rather severe look in the child&#39;s eyes.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh, ya.&#34;</font>
They moved their hand forward, disregarding the sudden shift in the air as he touched the cold child&#39;s forehead and flicked them with a finger.
<font color = white>&#34;Then make me.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) stands still, the air around them seemingly thickening at the intensity radiating from this child. He would watch keenly, the boys hand seemingly moving in slow motion. However, he would not even need to react as the girl with the enchanted aura grabbed the cabbage boys hand.

<font color = white>&#34;You even move like an old man. You couldn&#39;t hit me with a strike that slow if you tried&#34;</font>, he said coldly, still having not moved an inch from where he stood.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) With one more insult, she probably would have done what the cabbage-perfumed boy was doing.

For both of their sake, it was a good thing that he went before she could. Now, she just remained back to watch that scene unfold.

<font color = white>&#34;Knock it out, cabbage kid!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well...see ya later
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shifted their arm slightly, avoiding Rose&#39;s hand as he stared at the cold child. He placed his hands behind his head and sighed.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I think she saved you...At that speed you'd be lucky to hit a tiger-turtle while its sleeping!

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) asks: What is that you both gain from this convo?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) So much for letting things play out on their own.

Another insult tossed in the girl&#39;s direction immediately causes her to kiss her teeth. She rushes forward, the once-dying flame of anger relit within her spirit. It takes only a few strides for her to close the gap between herself and the androgynous youth. In that instant the gap is closed, her right hand curls into a fist.

     <font color = white>&#34;Shut... <b>UP!</b>&#34;</font>

Said fist is brought upward from the fiery blondes side. It rockets forward with accuracy and prowess unexpected of a girl of her stature and demeanor; danger lurking within just mere contact. All of that aggression is channeled into a mighty, organ rattling haymaker to the cold youth&#39;s stomach.

</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) is mid insult when a lightning fast strike barrels toward their stomach. His senses pick up in the shift of the girl before she moves, however his small body is not trained enough for his reflexes to allow him to react. 

In an instant, he feels his stomach collapse in on itself, as a hand is buried into his abdomen. They feel themselves sent reeling backwards, their small hands grasping their stomach, as they fall to their knees.

<font color = white>&#34;Owww! How...How could you?! You evil, hag!&#34;</font>, he coughs and sputters attemping to catch his breathe. He would feebly get to his feet, spreading his legs in a battle stance. His cold intensity quickly returning, as he rushes the girl, his fist clenched as he attempts to punch her in her hag face.

<font color = white>&#34;Take this!&#34;</font>, he yells, as his fist surges towards her face at a speed that would only be impressive to a beginner academy shinobi.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) In that moment where her fist pushes into the cold youth's midsection, there's almost a euphoric feeling for the inflictor of pain. A sense of self-inflicted justice nearly erases that rage in just that one strike-- a proper punishment for an act that <i>surely</i> would lead to change.

It even reflects in her face; a pursed lip relaxes into an almost shit-eating grin.

<i>'Hag'</i>..

A shame that such 'happiness' is cut short by yet <i>another</i> insult upon her, this time paired with a strike at her person. She steps back, the gap in their height providing her an easy advantage to avoid its returned strike. All it takes is a simple lean to avoid that inexperienced strike.

The one that responds is nothing of the sort.

As fist fades past her face, her body drops down to <i>its</i> height. Her other hand curls up now and, yes again, poises to send yet another thunderous blow to his gut.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) grunts as he exerts his full force behind his strike, yet his fist is met with the cold emotionless embrace of empty space. This girl...She was no ordinary academy student, yet the young Yuki's pride would not let him give up as he quickl began formulating his next plan.

That would be in vain though, as in the same instant as his fist missed her face, he would be met by the thunderous impact of another fist to his midsection. The sickening sound of crunching bones, shattering ribs, and youthful screaming erupting into the air.

His cold eyes would roll to the back of his head, as he crumbled to the ground holding his stomach before lurching over face down. His mind would go blank as he met the cold embrace of oblivion..Or rather unconciousness.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) squints.

<font color = white>&#34;Oooh..Is he okay?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko(The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) OOCs: (mb got food. sec.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) Another devastating shot to its core. Another feeling of relaxation. That scream it releases doesn&#39;t even register in the girl&#39;s head. Her fist relaxes, the palm catching the unconcious student as they fall forward. There comes only the slightest push-- a nudge to cause him to fall backwards rather than onto her.

A sigh of true relief exits her. With that situation handled, she turns back towards Beisame. Her stance relaxes back to its casual, laid back demeanor. There wasn&#39;t exactly a need to be hostile anymore.

     <font color = white>&#34;Can you believe that thing? How crazy!&#34;</font> She suggests, her finger pointing down towards their unconcious state.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) side eyes the profound blonde. It was noted not to mess with her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) let out a small but audible chuckle as he looked at the unconcious Yuki. Then back towards the profound blonde. His shoulders shifting as he shrugged, beginning to speak.
    <font color = white>&#34;My thoughts exact, I&#39;m glad it was settled though. Y&#39;have fun?&#34;</font>, he muttered. 

His gaze unwavering as if he had front-row seats to a boxing match. Even if in reality, this was a <i>squash match</i>, as they do in wrestling federations. Some form of pity was shared for the cold child. However, it was ultimately shrugged off - the <b>did</b> call his cousin <i>&#39;Sharky&#39;</i> after all.

She pauses, her pointing finger instead coming up to her cheek where she lightly taps. There wasn&#39;t any particular word for what she felt doing that. &#39;Fun&#39; almost felt too simple. Anything extra would be doing too much. Unable to come up with a solution, she merely shrugged in response.

    <font color = white>&#34;I feel he may be th&#39;type. Though, y&#39;can&#39;t help it I guess. Jus&#39; hope they don&#39;t try to jump you. Then again - I could join fighting &#39;em at that point.&#34;</font>, he spoke, beginning to chuckle a bit.

Fun via combat was something that didn&#39;t <i>fancy</i> him per se. But there wwas definitely monetary value when it comes to <b>combat</b> and the likes. Something this kid had an eye for.

Was she joking? Or was this the start of her peeping era.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) scoffed at the very notion.

     <font color = white>&#34;If <i>it</i> decides <i>it</i> wants to jump me, that&#39;ll be the day I make <i>its</i> face a permanent part of the bridge.&#34;</font> she responds.

Even with that threat and notion, she can&#39;t help but try and shrug it off again.

<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean, I've been asleep this whole time, so. I can't blame you.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Did I miss anything?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hey excuse me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice before busting out into a fit of laughter. Whilst it may have been quite a small topic to laugh at - it was quite funny to him before he began to speak to his cousin.
     <font color = white>&#34;Nawl, other than some scuffling and such. Was entertaining for the most part. But now it&#39;s my turn to do that standing-and-sleeping routine. Oh, right.&#34;</font>
    After speaking he turned to lean to whisper back, his voice carrying his previous joyful tune. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I need to make 1000 ryo.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's like.. Eight or nine construction shifts.

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ..I don't think all of us combined have that kind of cash to throw around.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: What do you need it for? Maybe I can pitch in if its important.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Potentially jutsus and weapons.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: But mainly jutsus probably.

<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Juts-- Anyway! If you're ever looking for me, just call out for 'Hana'. I'll answer. That or someone who knows me will.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s eyes seem to scrutinize the two males indiscriminetly. <font color = white>&#34;Sweet, cool names, I&#39;m Higane.&#34;</font> She paused, clicking her lips before continuing.

<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh jeez.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: What jutsu are you even interested in, Daigen.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: So.. Not Hee-Gaahh--Naay... but Hiii--Gaa--Nee?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm. Well Katon for one along with shurikenjutsu perhaps.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh... maybe I come up with a nickname instead-- Oh sweet, that sounds cool.. You have an affinity for that? I have no elemental affinity according to the chakra papers.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: No one from my clan really does, its weird. Maybe we're aliens.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, I don't think *everything* has a certain affinity for chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Like goats! You think every goat would utilize a different element? That'd be too complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I feel as though it'd be easy to guess my affinity.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Hmm..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) laxly pointed a finger towards the male&#39;s gills.

<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I guess a shinobi's work is never done.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) flexes his muscles, his opened robes displaying his chest and abdomen. The clearly older man with pupil-less eyes seemed to be smiling brightly.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) reeled his head back, placing his palms against his belly, and let out a loud guffaw.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I beat up that puppet so hard!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would hold his chin thinking on it, <font color = white>&#34;I always imagined you&#39;d have the same kind of dark hair of the hyuuga. You must have seen something so terrifying it dyed your hair white.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I actually used to be bed-ridden as a child! You could say I saw myself dying daily! So I must always keep training!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hoooh, interesting, I must say.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Maybe that's why my hair is also white, I might've been sickly
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: We gotta train that sickness out of you!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: I'd say I'm preeetty buff for right now, but I plan to get even stronger!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to be unwrapping his belt from around his middle.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Oh so you think you're buff huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: WELL TRAINING BEGINS NOW!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: N.. not as buff as yo--.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) asks: Eh?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) launches his belt at the boy. The belt was deceivingly long, reaching all the way from where Matsu stood to where the shark-ish boy was caught off guard.

The belt wrapped around the boy's body and restricted all movement unless he was somehow able to dodge the attack.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oi, oi! Don't- Don't whap my cousin with a belt, just because OUR clan head isn't here doesn't mean tha-
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oh man...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) drops the skill immediately after.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (you can RP the few seconds of the wrap)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Because I am not sealing a genin)
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Oh that seems like a jutsu I might want to look into.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink as he would see the other launch a spare bolt of cloth from their clothing. Watching the belt wrap around them. He would huh quietly, <font color = white>&#34;That is some quick clothe right there.&#34;</font>&#34; </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) The eyes of the boy flashed open as the cloth came and immediately wrapped around him. The life of this twelve year old breezed through his mind. All. Twelve. Years. By the time he had finished reliving every moment - the cloth  had returned back to its owner, seemingly. 

        Whilst others would be wary or on edge - Jinbeisame was.. surprisngly wholehearted. His arms pumped as he relives on that moment that played on him momentarily. 

     <i><font color = white>&#34;That was soooo~ cool..! I want that technique, man! Though, I doubt I&#39;ll ever try and learn it for now..&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) wraps the belt back around himself, nodding all the while. When his robes are once more fully secured around his waste, he folds his arms one over the other and puffs out his muscular chest.

<font color = white>&#34;You should never assume you are not in danger at every possible moment! You should always strive to be the strongest, like me!&#34;</font> He would then look around to the nearby students, hoping to have impressed them.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I am a master at many arts!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Once you all graduate I shall pass on some of my secrets!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: You should see what I can do to people who can use elemental ninjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: What kind of arts interest you all?
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I am interested in Elemental ninjitsu, as well as throwing weapons.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Though I am following a clan herritage.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I can demonstrate a shurinkenjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oh, right. I forgot to fill out that form.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: ... Later, I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: A clan huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Which do you come from?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) took a glance back at the soft-featured boy, then at the Hyuuga. Then, back at the boy. And back at the Hyuuga. Once more, at the boy. And then, at the Hyuuga. 

<font color = white>&#34;... Really?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Yes!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would blink up at him, with a short bow from them. <font color = white>&#34;I am from the Yuki Clan, I believe Saigosame is making a note on my appearance being rather... Typical for my clan.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Man.. Y'got lucky, I could'a for sure broke out of that, maybe..
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Though, I do plan on tailoring up some fine things for myself to wear. Maybe something in red? Blue would be very stereotypical.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean- I'm not one to judge, I'm blue. But the hair, the pale, fair skin, the soft jawline and the big, doe-like eyes were a bit of a giveaway.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) was standing there, perfectly still. The next moment, he had appeared infront of the half-shark boy. A trail of kicked up dirt could be spotted the base of the two spots he travelled between.

He looked down from his superior height and gave a sickly sweet smile, <font color = white>&#34;Want to try a harder one?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) answered dead fast.

<font color = white>&#34;N-.&#34;</font>

<b><i>He already closed the damned distance.</b></i></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) began to lift a finger to cast a sign, but stopped. <font color = white>&#34;Hm... Perhaps you&#39;re not brave enough!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Sup.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) placed his hands along his waist, his chest poking out. Whether it be a sense of bravado, or simply not wanting to look like a coward in front of the crowd, he shook his head.

<font color = white>&#34;Give it y-your best shot, bwahaha..ha..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Going to judge you forever Saigosame.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: there will be a day, when you are a tall gruff shark man.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: and you say outloud, 'I love fish sticks'
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: and I will stare wordlessly at you infront of your genin squadron.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Eh? I mean. I don't know, maybe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) pushed his head back and gaffawed once more. <font color = white>&#34;Attaboy!&#34;</font> He exclaimed, raising only one hand before forcing his chakra to the student before him.

At once, the ground around both of them seemed to be decorated in black markings- connecting the two of them. The boy would feel immense pressure on himself, glueing him to the spot and stopping any limb movement save for his mouth.

(B+ Power)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) simply stopped walking down the bridge as she watched the scene unfold, the girl blinked, deciding to simply shrug upon the sight of the death delievering Matsu was just practicing.

<font color = white>&#34;Welp, he&#39;s dead.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) Any sense of affirmation was quickly absorbed. Being praised for his courageous spirit - or pute stupidity, you choose - Jinbeisame stood still, and stood proud. Well, it wasn&#39;t like he had <i>much choice</i>.

Given the time to perform their next feat, the half-shark was frozen in place. Completely unmoving. Whilst his mouth retained its former motor functions - leaving him the ability to grunt whilst trying to regain his posture.

<font color = white>&#34;Th&#39;hell.. Is.. This..?! I&#39;m <b><i>frozen</b></i> of all things?! This is so disorientating but so.. coool~..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) released the sealing barrier and then slapped the boy HARD on the back. <font color = white>&#34;You did great! What&#39;s your name kiddo?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (i say hard but str is my dump)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) watches from the side as he watches the sealing jutsu. A little Oooo leaving him. He leans to the side a little as he begins to think on that. Sealing people in place.... freeezing them in place. Perfectly perserved.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stumbled forward, his face shining with a new light before looking up towards the figure. The thumb of the boy jabbing at himself.
            <i><font color = white>&#34;Why, I am Jinbeisame of the Hoshigaki Clan! Though, like my sleeping blonde friend, y&#39;can call me &#39;Beisame!&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Hoshigaki? Wow! I couldn't tell!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) did not seem to be sarcastic.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) nodded proudly.

<font color = white>&#34;Right?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Got t'be the hair, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Or something about the eyes!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Ah! Maybe, maybe!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Anyways! Someone here mentioned shurinkenjutsu!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Would you like to see a technique you could realistic learn after graduation, or perhaps something a bit more advanced?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: No takers it seems!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Oooh.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: SHow me.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) asks: Alright! Mika, would you like realistic or advanced?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) tilts her head, she brings her hand up to her cheek, scratching it gently. <font color = white>&#34;Realistic.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) would nod as he leans over thinking on that, <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d be fine with seeing both realistic, and advanced....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: Aye why not both?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) removes the upper part of his robes, taking his arms out of the sleeves and letting the cloth fall down below his waste. His body was muscular as one would expect, but around the chest and ribs, several back markings decorated his skin. He pressed his hand against one near his armpit, and a puff of smoke was produced.

When the smoke cleared, he was holding a set of three shurinkens, he flipped them like one would a coin across his knuckles. <font color = white>&#34;Pretty standard run-of-the-mill throwing stars no?&#34;</font> He asked, smiling brightly. <font color = white>&#34;Well see if you can dodge this!&#34;</font>

He winked as he threw the high-speed shurinkens at Mikazuki!

The girl would have time to react before they seemingly missed her and went around her- though she would see the trick coming up if she had superior eyesight. A second of peace later, he pulled back his arm, ensaring the girl in wires.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki(The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) OOCs: (what speed this is coming in?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Matsu(The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) OOCs: (Uh for sake of roleplay, C+ if no sight, or E if sight)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) blinks, the girl widened her eyes as she witnessed Matsu summon ninja tools out of a seal in his body, she tilted her head a tad bit, the girl saw the Shuriken coming her way, the speed of the projectiles clearly made her surprised. Plaid eyes scan across the objects as she quickly goes inwards, advancing against the thrown weapons, she dashed forth in order to no longer be a standing target, so the trajectory of the projectiles would shift.

Though shrolled forward quickly in an attempt of dodging the weapons. <font color = white>&#34;Ugh!&#34;</font>

She immediately got up after the weapons passed away, though- As she got up and looked past the shuriken going forth in their normal trajectory, she&#39;d feel a strange, tangling wire wrapping about her torso.

Her arms were glued together right after quite immediately and she&#39;d find her arms restricted-

<font color = white>&#34;HEH?! OH WHERE DID THAT COME FROM?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) watches the other whip a flurry of shurriken out! He would watch as they would pull at the wires. He even didn&#39;t see them initially. An impressed, &#39;Ooooo&#39; leaving the boy as he watches them weave and change trajectories! Wrapping about the girl suddenly. <font color = white>&#34;Very neat!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) released his grip on the wires, releasing the young Hyuuga from the imprisonment. When the wires fell to the ground at her feet, Matsu slowly pulled them along with the shurinken back towards him, coiling it.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s Ayatsuito, really handy when people move around too much for you to hit em.&#34;</font>He then produced a small scroll and placed the weapons in the center. A flash of smoke appeared, and the weapons were now gone- leaving behind only the scroll with a different pattern written on it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Putting them back on my torso is a pain, but I wanted to show off a bit!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I'll have to restock that later!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: Ha, certainly showing off.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) says: I'm going to need a lot of senbon the more I think about it..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: They get expensive fast!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I have something planned for you all in a couple months!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: I'll get Botan and Shion to help me show you all what a real battle is like!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) puffed his chest out, <font color = white>&#34;I wager I can take on BOTH of them on at the same time!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) spun as the wire was pulled like in a cartoon, on her own axis. She stopped on a perfect straight position as she was forth and glared Matsu like nothing has happened.

<font color = white>&#34;...Ooh.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) stretched out, <font color = white>&#34;Well I should go hit the sack! I have an early mission tomorrow! But I will be around and about a bit later in the day!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Huh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Maybe later Bill.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: Surrreee ya weren mad yo ya face just went red cause its hot ya know?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) A bead of sweat falls from his brow. Whilst one eye kept staring at the altercation northbound. The other instantly drifted over towards the pocket which contained her coins.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) hopped toward the crowd, almost skipping. A suspiciously good mood, considering he was wedgied, robbed and thrown into the water recently.

They said, moving the torch closer to their face, their eyes filled with curiosity. They were trying to familiarize themselves with the feeling of the heat, inhaling and exhaling in a crude attempt to train their Katon affinity.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki stands amidst the bustling activity of his peers, a subtle awareness prickling at the edge of his senses. He feels the weight of someone's gaze upon him, a piercing stare trying to draw his attention. Keeping his arms folded across his chest, he remains outwardly composed, his expression unreadable.

His gaze drifts off into the distance, not directly meeting the source of the glare but aware of its presence. The atmosphere around him buzzes with energy, conversations blending into a low hum that he tunes out effortlessly. Sogeki's mind wanders briefly, contemplating the day's events and the tasks ahead.

Then, a movement catches his eye—a flicker of motion on the edge of the training ground. It's an interaction he hasn't seen before, unfolding with intrigue and curiosity. Intrigued, Sogeki's focus shifts, his analytical mind now fully engaged as he observes with a keen interest, temporarily forgetting the lingering sensation of someone's scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki's gaze sharpened as he recognized the familiar aura—sharp, unyielding, like a blade slicing through the air. It was the stern bastard from a few days ago, the one who dared to challenge him openly. Without shifting his stance, Sogeki turned his attention towards the source of the voice, his eyes fixing on the shark-like boy.

Their eyes locked in a silent duel, each assessing the other with unspoken intensity. Sogeki's stare was icy, piercing, as if daring the other to meet his gaze head-on. He conveyed a silent challenge through his unwavering glare, a message of defiance and readiness to engage if provoked.

Despite the tension, Sogeki remained composed, arms folded across his chest, exuding an air of quiet confidence. He waited, patient yet vigilant, observing how the sharkboy would react under his unwavering scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And for your knowledge,i read medical books,but at other times a different sorts of ones aswell
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the veteran,the commander, as they spoke, and he wondered what fate they had just doomed his peer to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stared blankly at Sogeki. He pushed his glasses up, the sunlight glinting off the lenses dramatically. He pointed, positioning his body sideways. <font color = white>&#34;You act like a robot. I&#39;d fight you now but alas...&#34;</font> He tilted is head down sadly, <font color = white>&#34;I am without shoes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was being chased?! This was no good. His rolling wasn&#39;t taking him far.
<font color = white>&#34;New plan.&#34;</font>

He was going to do the most unstoppable means of escape. Springing out of his ball form and then going completely still. Like a...like uhh...-like a STATUE!!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) The squint didn&#39;t leave Sogeki&#39;s face. The embedding threat that stands before him.. it rocks Sogeki&#39;s core. Naturally, he&#39;s shaking in his boots.. But he refuses to dishonor the Satetsu name by back down.

Sogeki stands strong-- and steps forward even stronger.

The aggressive lad accepts his fate.
  <font color = white>&#34;Ready to accept my consequences. I simply allow for at least a two on one opportunity. I wish for my father to recognize my body after this.. Commander.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Satetsu, Sogeki(The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) OOCs: (by backing*)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) inched a bit forward.. still confused by what was developing infront of her, before asking. <font color = white>&#34;Help with what...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) approaches Sogeki and settles a large hand on their shoulder, his figure towering them easily. <font color = white>&#34;My soldiers do <i>not</i> yield. But I admire such personality.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The hunt will be retracted. Tell me your name.

The weight of the veteran&#39;s hand on his shoulder is both comforting and imposing, a reminder of the authority he carries. Sogeki meets the veteran&#39;s gaze with a defiant glare, the flames of determination burning fiercely in his eyes despite the fear that churns within him.

He stands his ground, unwilling to show weakness despite the overwhelming presence of the veteran. Sogeki knows the importance of respect in the shinobi world, especially when facing someone of higher rank. Yet, beneath the surface, his resolve remains unbroken, a testament to his unwavering spirit amidst the intimidating atmosphere.

<font color = white>&#34;..of the Satetsu. But soon everyone will call me the Kraken Slayer.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If my soldier says they will obtain a title then that it is how it will be.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Do you understand?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stared in complete astonishment. Beginning to wonder if this boy named <i>Blast</i> was sent here by some cosmic entity.. Though - sleep or not.. Still or not! 

                         <b><i>HE HAD A JOB TO DO.</b></i>

Manipulating his body in such a dramatic fashion as if he was a <i>snake</i>. His presence looming over behind him. It was time. <b><i>Fifty damned Ryo was at stake!</b></i>
      <i><font color = white>&#34;Pin him down as I~...!&#34;</font></i>

The half-shark would grasp the top of his briefs, wasting no time before hopping over his body soon after. Delivering a <i>vicious</i> <b><i>WEDGIE</b></i>! Certainly giving Asa some flashbacks of his very own from the day prior. Landing over the boy he would stand proud. A grin sprayed over his face.

<b><i>The job.. was done.</b></i></font></font></font>

Sogeki thinks for a moment, then shrugs. He eases into the comfort of the topic.
  <font color = white>&#34;I do.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;But not without cause. Even if it&#39;s frowned upon by the public.. if it needs to be done. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

That is his S-rank mission afterall.

The study each of them and gift them tasks and an environment that will benefit their growth.

<font color = white>&#34;Fine,&#34;</font> he starts, squeezing the boy&#39;s shoulder, <font color = white>&#34;Kraken Slayer must be earned.&#34;</font>

A punch occurs, far too fast to be seen by anyone around. It plants into Sogeki&#39;s stomach with cratering force.

His hand falls from the boy&#39;s shoulder, leaving them to relish in the impacts recoil.

<font color = white>&#34;Now. Why do I see someone giving wedgies?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) didn&#39;t care anymore. His face, having been pasted full of horror, stayed facing the ground. His tone speaking as if he was already dead.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) side-eyes the Hoshigaki whom had fallen victim to the bad example set by the laborer the day before.

    Whilst everyone was looking towards the Hoshigaki Nahoko stole a moment to check up on her hair in the reflection of the monument north o fher.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;..ok.&#34;</font>
Then he waddles over at impecable speed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s body jerks forward as the veteran&#39;s fist slams into his stomach with brutal force. The impact sends a shockwave of pain through him, causing him to grit his teeth and stagger backward. His hands instinctively clutch at his abdomen, trying to alleviate the intense ache that spreads from the point of impact.

Despite the pain, Sogeki locks eyes with the crimson-haired veteran, his gaze unwavering. His pride refuses to let him show weakness or back down, even in the face of such a harsh lesson. He takes a deep breath, swallowing his pride along with the pain, and straightens up slowly, though the discomfort is evident on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand,&#34;</font> Sogeki manages to say through clenched teeth, his voice strained but defiant. He exhales sharply, willing himself to remain composed despite the throbbing pain in his gut. His eyes remain fixed on the veteran, a silent acknowledgment of the respect he holds for the commander&#39;s authority.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: One of you will be punished for unorderly conduct.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look at Higane.

<font color = white>&#34;You are a scared cat,aren&#39;t you&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The other will be punched in the stomach by Sogeki.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) Walked quickly over to the scene about to happen. Someone other than him getting abused by their elder? A sight to behold.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Drainage of your chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: ..I shall take th'brunt of both punishments, if possible.. I am th'cause.. I'll accept th'just rights..
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Silence.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Pick one of the three.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: And here I thought shinobi were supposed to take jobs for money...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) stood there silently.

Then he broke the silence.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m confused. Do we still have to be silent?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) regretably shakes her head. <i>How far we have fallen.</i></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: That'd be hard y'know. Since we have to verbally choose.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Shh...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: If you had like a piece of paper I could point to pick.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: He hasn't noticed I was somewhat involved.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) remained otherwise idle as the Hoshigaki made his way through the gathering of shinobi. The actual act wasn&#39;t her end goal here. Unfortunately...

     <font color = white>&#34;Oh.. That&#39;s..&#34;</font>

When he walked back over, she observed his demeanor and that call he made-- She, too, widened her eyes with shock. Not one ounce of her wanted to imagine what that felt like. 

Before she could offer a hand or deliver his justice..

He was gone.

<i>It seems her point had been made.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) asks: Haginane over there also assisted his assault. Is that why we have three options?

<font color = white>&#34;And a oop!&#34;</font> She jolted in a muffled tone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers: Sounds right. I was just tryin' to teach Beisame something but..

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: She so is. How dare she.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Don't you get why she is raising her tone.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: How dare he even speak at such volumes to you. He thinks you're too stupid to say someones name correctly.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) says: I hope he doesn't hurt her too bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) claps his hands together. <font color = white>&#34;Enough. I&#39;ve decided. All three are to be hunted.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: After the punch of course.

    His arm sliding out of his sleeve as his upper body laid bare. Turning southbound to face Sogeki. The student granted the privilege of hunting and punching him. This was perfectly fine to him.

The neck of his cracked as he readied himself. His right hand raising itself, motioning in a &#39;<i>come on, then</i>&#39; gesture. Thus he spoke finally.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Hunt me? Fine then, let&#39;s do it. Punch me? Do it..</b>&#34;</font>, his finger pointed in Najiro&#39;s direction, his face grinning widely as he continued.
     <font color = white>&#34;<b>This is what it means t&#39;follow orders!!! I want you to hunt me with all yer might.. It&#39;s yer order, Najiro. Whether it&#39;s right or wrong - you commit to it!!!</b>&#34;</font>

His blue-scaled hand beated his chest as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;<b>Let&#39;s not hold th&#39;Commander up. Deliver yer blow.</b>&#34;</font>, he spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;..for the Commander,&#34;</font> Sogeki whispers.

The impact of his action is felt heavily in the tense silence that follows, hanging in the air as a testament to the Commander&#39;s authority and the consequences of crossing it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) thought about it. Questions. Questions are important. Questions get answers. Questions like 'How hard is he going to punch Haginini? Is the commander a man or woman? Where are my shoes?'</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) took the hit full-on. His face grimacing for a moment. <i>Just one moment.</i> Before it morphed back into it&#39;s previous position. His teeth being gritted before his posture straightened up. 

        Moving along to the side, letting the next recipient take their turn in receiving the punch from the fellow student, Sogeki.
