He looked ready to deliver the Hyuuga's famous open palm blows. He pulled his right back back at the hip level, building momentum. However, instead of an open palm, he curled his fingers forwards resembling a grasping motion.

To those looking at his hand, they would see each finger glow a menacingly purple color in turn - starting with the pinky. In a swift strike, he would slam the fingers into the Hoshigaki's middle.

The blow did not seem to hurt the boy, he could feel something was OFF about him.</font></font></font>

However...

It barely moved the Hoshigaki, simply inching them back half a stepas the shark blinked in confusion. They peered down at their body from under that large straw hat, then back up at the Hyuuga, then back down, and back up once more.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m... Not entirely sure what that did, but it did <b>something</b>.&#34;</font>, they remarked, moving their arms, their legs, rolling their neck - Something was off, but they couldn&#39;t quite figure out what just yet.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) offered a sharp nod, throwing their hands together in a rather slow weaving of seals, intending to utilize the Bunshin technique. However...

<font color = white>&#34;... Nothing&#39;s happening. I&#39;m <b>positive</b> I weaved them correctly... It&#39;s...&#34;</font>

Their brow furrowed for a moment, before widening in shock.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s like I can&#39;t... Mold my chakra. Something&#39;s like... I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just different.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (either Speed to avoid jutsu, or build to clash jutsu, or interrupt handseals)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (ah yeah
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (my advise is if you go for shurrikenjutsu to interrupt have speed enough to evade
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (shunshin that is, 
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Shanin(The black haired teen-Toopher2) OOCs: (My advise is everyone builds for making big booms and being able to rp flexing your chakra on people.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (but if you have plenty of chakra, just build to clash)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (probably might get bodied my first 70 fights
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (tbh, here's my advice
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (no matter your build
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (buy 2 ranks in shurikenjutsu
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (My advise is to always have just enough shurriken jutsu, 2 ranks yeah
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (it's only 7 points, it gives you +3 inventory slots, and you can throw two tools per round instead of one
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (it's value
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (Even if you're not a shurriken build, you always want to spend resources to win, and shurriken throwing is a damage resource)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (though i swear it used to be cheaper
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (forcing people to evade or take damage is sometimes enough to tip a fight)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (though tbh you could spend 9 points and get +6 instead of +3
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (but that's on you
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (Also NEVER be well rounded)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (well rounded builds are senju exclusive)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (that is the senju shtick after all)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (the combat system is going to take a while to learn

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame(The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) OOCs: (also hashirama path is a genjutsu
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (My most Solid of solid advise, is to pick a main Damage stat, the stats being Strength, agility, control, Endurance speed and Stamina are defensive stats)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yuki, Aoi(The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) OOCs: (pick one of agility, strength, or speed. And lean on it as your main damage stat. Strenght for tai and weapons, agility for throwing and 'certain' weapons, and control for jutsu
