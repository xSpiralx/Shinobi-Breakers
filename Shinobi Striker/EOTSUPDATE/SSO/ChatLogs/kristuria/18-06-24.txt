She sloppily lunges to the right to narrowly avoid the kick, though it leaves her to fall to the ground with a thud.
   <font color = white>&#34;Shit..&#34;</font>

Luckily, her ally had her back! A well-timed set of shuriken would steal their target&#39;s attention, enough to where she can scramble back to her feet--.

Despite the distance, the pressure of the Commander&#39;s presence weighs heavily on Sogeki&#39;s shoulders, causing him to tense involuntarily. His arms remain folded across his chest, a facade of calm amidst the chaos unfolding around him.

Three brash Genin, emboldened by misguided courage or sheer recklessness, launch an audacious attack on the Commander during what was supposed to be a solemn and structured <font color = white>&#34;hunt.&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s eyes narrow slightly as he observes from the shadows, his expression a mix of disbelief and cautious curiosity. He knows the consequences of such a brazen act—consequences that could potentially disrupt the fragile balance of their world.

Despite the chaos and the surge of conflicting emotions within him, Sogeki remains rooted in place. His mind races, calculating the possible outcomes of this reckless action, yet he remains steadfast, his decision clear. He watches silently, waiting to see how the Commander will respond to this unforeseen challenge, knowing full well that the repercussions could shape their futures in ways they couldn&#39;t yet comprehend.</font></font></font>

It was at this time, when her train of thought was ceasing to exist, and she was fully starting to rely on raw instinct.

<i>Fight or Flight, Endorphins, Norepinephrine, all released by her parasympathetic nervous system</i>

Then suddenly... <i>It all ceased</i>

The jarring sensation of raw energy smacking straight into her scrambled her very thoughts. Was it because she was point blank range? or perhaps because the energy was more focused on her? 

Nonetheless, she seemed to take it worse than the rest of the students.. Her Byakugan shut itself off, the small bed of capilleries and veins simply retracting as her eyes went dull and blank.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Yes, Commander..&#34;</font>, he spoke as his gaze shifted towards the crimson-haired veteran. Should the hunt continue another or not, was ultimately undecided as of now. Nor did it matter much, to him at least. The only slight of this was that.. 
    He was just beginning to have some fun with this.

He squints and makes a decision after brief thought.

<font color = white>&#34;My soldiers are to stand aside and cease their hunt. I have much to make clear.&#34;</font>

A pivot occurs, one last glance given to the Hyuuga before he settles both hands behind his back. He needs not battle.
Only war will call him to stir his chakra so.

<font color = white>&#34;I am second only to the Kage.&#34;</font> A glance given to the Hyuuga jonin. Hopefully a level of understanding is made with that statement alone. <font color = white>&#34;I am your Commander. If you think my forge is too hot then you may exit and never return. Left aside to become coal. Or you can stay and be melted into the <i>sharpest</i> blade.&#34;</font>

He moves towards Nahoko and settles a hand on her shoulder.

<font color = white>&#34;To disrespect me will result in discipline. Nothing else. As I said before, I <b>will</b> lay my life down for my soldiers. I will do it without thought because I am <b>YOUR</b> commander!&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Without much thought, Sogeki lifts his fist.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Akito (The bright boy-TimesofNeed) would finally hop off the bench, before slowly making his way closer and closer towards the commotion and the yelling from the Commander. His interest was piqued, exactly...what was the problem here? He couldn't even tell....but, he was down to listen to this voicetrous shinobi that seemed like he had seen some shit. The bright boy would remain silent, just observing things for now...and seeing if this were all to go anywhere....or not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) looked down at his unconcious fellow Hyuuga, a member of his own bloodline. Anger built up inside him, he could not hold it back. The happy-go-lucky attitude he adopted normally shattered as he let out a hissing breath of, <font color = white>&#34;I swear to fucking god...&#34;</font>

Then out of nowhere, the Hyuuga liften his hand up to hold a sign. He held it up for a solid second, trying to will the victim to react before he did what he was itching to do.

The next second, the unconcious Hyuuga would be forced awake by an activation of his curse mark, <font color = white>&#34;What the fuck are you thinking?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) crossed his arms and furrowed his brow. <i><font color = white>&#34;<b>Our</b> commander?&#34;</font></i> he thought.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) falls to the floor after being released, in a muffled <i>thud</i>. She lands on her knees slumped over. The young Hyuuga is not fully unconcious but seems to be in a dazed like state.

She lays there slumped over, arms limp at her side..

Unable to <i>react, think, feel or speak</i>

<i>Until....</i>

A jolting headache, one that she has previously experienced before. It sears the back of her eyes like pressing a blazing iron onto the skin of cattle. Suddenly she is forced out of her daze like state by the sheer pain.

Akin to breaking a Genjutsu, Higane could only hold her head with both hands in pain. A curling scream echo&#39;s out of her throat in a ghastly fashion..

<font color = white>&#34;<i>Gyaaaaaaaaah!!!!!</i>&#34;</font> Once again her eyes opened, tears slowly bubbling out of them.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) It was a momentous day for the Hozuki. Earlier this afternoon, she was thinking of who she was going to nab shoes from. Now, all she could think of was the gap in skill between herself and her peers, and the invigorating Commander that led them all. She clutches the bottom of her baggy hoodie and her chest swells with pride as he gives a speech that rouses those listening.

Determined to better herself by and means, she quietly, yet resolutely thrusts her fist up as high as it would go.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) isn&#39;t going to allow that to happen. No. He can&#39;t.

He isn&#39;t fast enough to close the distance-- he knows that..

But what he can do is possibly aid in a distraction.
  <font color = white>&#34;..oi, oi..&#34;</font>

Sogeki pushes off the monument, digs into his leg holster, and extracts a set of wooden shuriken. In just a moments notice, the wooden shuriken are sent flying for the attacking Hyuuga&#39;s temple.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) The commander&#39;s words echoed the weight of their voice, stopping the hunt as all turned to the commander in response to their booming voice, and even he felt captivated.
<font color = white>&#34;ARGH!&#34;</font>
They raised their torch into the air, chakra flooding into their lungs as they roared out a replay, and their torch burned brightly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) glanced at the commander and clicked to his tongue, <font color = white>&#34;Either way he might be the second in command, but he&#39;s not the second only to the hokage in terms of strenght.

     The boy plucked his kunai up, considering the hunt, <i>over?</i> Who knows, it was still undecided and for now, he simply wanted to be done with this - or should the Commander command it - continue having his fun.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>I&#39;m with you, Commander..</b>&#34;</font>, he spoke. Not caring for the transgressions of the past, the half shark was simply continuing on in the now.</font></font></font>

Noticing that there was people on the Commanders side he felt that he wasn&#39;t needed, and would only be a hinderance for them. <font color = white>&#34;well looks like some stuff is about to indeed happen.&#34;</font>

<i>Swoosh, thud... thud...</i>

The set of wooden Shuriken succesfully imbed themselves into Higane's right shoulder, left leg and right arm.

Not a single sound exits her mouth.

Before making his way to the Central Point of the Village and finally, heading up the staircase, right to the Academy. Once there, he would turn around and look at both Atkin and Shanin.

<font color = white>&#34;This is where our Academy is located. I hope you both remember our little arrangement and keep it in mind. I look forward to checking up on your progress of training soon. Don&#39;t let me down Atkin, Shanin, alright?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Not strong enough. Not yet. You're too kind, Reilin. Thanks.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) yells: Yes!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Taijutsu, fuuinjutsu, shurikenjutsu...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'm trying not to just be a carbon-copy of Choko-sensei, but...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Isn't fuuinjutsu pretty hard and time consuming to learn?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I am not sure I could invest in that. More respect to you.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: It's just formula, mostly.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: A different kind of learning.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Fuuinjutsu confused me. I don't think I'll ever use it...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Are you planning on getting by with just rocks?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Yep! No better way to do it.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: Why throw shuriken when I can throw rocks?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Good point...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: What's the coolest earth jutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Whichever one I make myself!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) asks: Does it include throwing more rocks?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Hmm...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I have decided.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I'm making the two most forbidden jutsus ever.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: -Maybe.- ... But, if it can be something even cooler than just throwing 'em... heh.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Pocket Sand.  Pocket Salt.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: Ack! Why would you wanna throw salt!?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Have you never got salt in your eye before?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Hard to fight in that condition.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Just throw it in your enemy's eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: No... but that sounds crazier than sand.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) yells: That sounds effective. AND you have six hands!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Six hands to throw six hands full of it!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: o-oh?..i dont mind at all...mhm...i just want you to come back to us safely Shuye....a-and..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: doton..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) stamped his feet on the ground and surfaced to full stature as Katora did his speedy getaway. A sore sternum was a low cost for the glory of a confidence boost from the analytical combatant before him.

  A beige-colored haze is tossed into his face with guile, too much sand for lashes to stop. A dirty trick prime for use by academy students with nothing else to improvise with.

  <font color = white>&#34;Ah. .!&#34;</font> It catches him off guard, but his eyes were already somewhat small and inset, so the skill had an awkward outcome. Yurei would shake his head in a blurry way to clear his vision, spitting.
 He had respect for the tactic, afterall, no rules for fairplay set in the beginning.

  <font color = white>&#34;That was pretty good, throwin&#39; weapons move faster than any person can. That was fun, we should do it again sometime.&#34;</font> The youngster laughed out as both hands were placed behind his neck.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) asks: me?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I won't be taking any risks.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: You can use a rock-like-doton?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Yea you.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mhm, i definately do!..or well i have no reason to not like her...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: I mean like umm....LIKE like.
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: and define rock..like doton..
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: Huh? Who doesn't like-like Shuye?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: Oh wow.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) asks: Also! You said you could do something that's like Doton?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) looks differently at Shuye.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Agreed. We should. Some time after graduation, maybe. 
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Until then? I'll be refining my tactics. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned toward Venturo with a quirked brow, then turned back toward Kohana with a scowl.

<font color = white>&#34;...&#34;</font>

The silence could be heard.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: like..i can..lower to the ground and change the landscape....with judo moves
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fuma, Katora(The blond lad-Iodized Salt) OOCs: [didn't have disc open and saw that announcement late, rip shuriken]

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: and a little bit of crumple..mhm
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) is just there, like usual, smiling.
He understood <i>everything</i> going on. Absolutely.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;Well, this has been... interesting,&#34;</font> she said, glancing between Venturo and Shuye. <font color = white>&#34;So, uh, Venturo, what&#39;s the story behind this pebble?&#34;</font> She held it up with a curious look, hoping to steer the conversation into safer waters. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m guessing there&#39;s more to it than just being pretty, right?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) asks: pebble?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) says: He gave me this swirling pebble and said I look like it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would say as she breifly stopped talking nonsense for a moment and...as she focused more in on her writting.

Occasionally spinning her quill..hmm</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: He gave me a pebble as well.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I think he gives all the girls pebbles.
<br><font color=green>*Sakujak, Kaji (The beige haired youth-Lackluster and Dreadful - Pup) says: Pebble...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) knows that Kohana has no idea what she just signed herself on to. Story time? About rocks?
He inhales deeply.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I was out on one of my usual walks, thinking about what it was I was going to do today. Then, about ten minutes away from my house, I accidentally tripped over an ant hill that was the size of my pinkie toe... but in my stumbling...&#34;</font>
Again, there is this shining glint in his eye as he goes on. His body seems to almost be buzzing with excitement.

<font color = white>&#34;I saw something move underneath a nearby rock pile! So I got to digging and shuffling around... and there it was..&#34;</font>
As if he had the rock given in his hands, he brings the two of his hands infront of him, reliving the moment from this morning again. 

<font color = white>&#34;Blue and shiny! Just like your eyes. Mhm. It was destiny that you got that rock as a gift!&#34;</font>

Perking his head back up to what the kimono wearing individual had been saying about judo chops, he waves a hand over her way.
<font color = white>&#34;You gotta show me how you can do that sometime! That sounds so cool!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Wao, pebbles.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: I gotta find one for you, Tsu.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Heh.  Thanks.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Wow, what a stroy.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: Every day is an adventure, Shuye... Every one.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Never forget it!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Hoshino, Kohana (The thoughtful, composed girl-MoreLife) Kohana couldn&#39;t quite make sense of Venturo&#39;s story. To her, it was just a rock. However, her curiosity got the better of her, and she couldn&#39;t help but ask one thing.

<font color = white>&#34;Venturo, do you -only- give these rocks to girls?&#34;</font> she asked, a mischievous tone in her voice. <font color = white>&#34;Are you, perhaps, what they call a serial... romance seeker? If so, I believe we have therapists for that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
