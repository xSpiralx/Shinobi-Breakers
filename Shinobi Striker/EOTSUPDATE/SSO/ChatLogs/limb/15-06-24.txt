<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) wafts his hand about his nose, not much liking the smell of cabbage. Thankfully the smell didn’t really stick.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello young....student. What is all of this commotion....&#34;</font> he trails off, looking at the gathered many before continuing. But as if it were a new statement. <font color = white>&#34;About.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uzumaki, Nakagawa (The short red-headed boy-Godlike2909) glanced toward the commanding man, giving him a once over before he lowered down onto the ground, taking a seat.

<font color = white>&#34;Some kind of tournament is happening or something&#34;</font> He said as he raised and lowered his shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked flinched a bit as the commanding man waved his hand, and they felt self-conscious about their smell for a moment.
<font color = white>&#34;Uh, We are organizing a tournament amongst us students.
Miss Botan is going to oversee it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) Walks up to the group after hearing about a tournament and smiles.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh the kids are working on a little tourny, isnt that just fun.&#34;</font>

He continued to watch them to see how it woud progress.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) itches his chin for a moment, before loooking between the group.

<font color = white>&#34;Miss Botan also going to be providing a reward?&#34;</font> He looks over to the Jonin, who would know this wasn’t a spectator from within the village. But one sent by the Shogun for the youth</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Mhm...i wonder if i can get wooden shurikens
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) spots the figure and offers a head nod. If he was luck it would be enough to lure him over to his side of the crowd. Should the jounin warp to his position a few words would be exchanged as they whispered to one another. Maintain a sense of privacy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) folds his arms while side-eyeing the jonin next to him. They reeked of something.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) walks off to the side, half listening to what's going on behind him, while also just observing the body of water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) shook their head.
<font color = white>&#34;They didn&#39;t offer one, so we were just going to try to pull whatever resources we had for the top three.&#34;</font>
They looked at the ground for a minute as so many high-ranking people appeared out of nowhere.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) kept herself still in the distance, their eyes seem to perk over towards the crowd with curiosity, the scroll carrier in the distance particularly catching up their attention, eyes press gently in a squeeze, only to widden again. They've managed to catch up the youngling's attention for the time being itseems.

A ceaseless, unblinking stare.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) noticing the boy nod to him he quickly walked around the group and made his way clumsily towards him. Not cool or interesting in the least. No teleporting or cool moves used. just akward <font color = white>&#34;excuse me, pardon me, sliding by&#34;</font> words as he made his way through the crowd. He would stop by the boy and smile. <font color = white>&#34;Need something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers: Mhm, yes indeed. I noticed your uniform is different from the chuunin - what rank might you be sir?
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says:  We have nine people so if everyone pitched in it should be a nice little reward...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) would pass the scroll to the commanding man showing them all the names</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mitaki, Totsu (The unassuming boy-Soft boi 903) says: I don't have any ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I am a jonin a rank above Chunin its nice to see so many new faces around here feels like this year is going to be an interesting one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) had paid close attention to the jounin as he drew closer to the cluster of children from the north. His posture, demeanor and tone seemed far too mature to be a chuunin. 

<font color = white>&#34;I am Kryu&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You tell me..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) squints her eyes from afar, nothing escapes the young girls vision.. Let alone a big celebrity like Shion.

<font color = white>&#34;Holy crap! It&#39;s Master Shion! He&#39;s like famous you know!?&#34;</font> She shouted over the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And their mother being a hoe
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers: Well How shall I address you sir?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Masaki (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) reads through the scroll swiftly, with something tucked between the parchment now

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I can watch then 500 ryo goes to the victor, 250 to the runner-up&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) asks: A tournament? Now?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) He would present himself with a respecful standing expression and look at the young boy. <font color = white>&#34;You can call me-&#34;</font> He would hear the girl blurt out and he would stop looking respectful and start trying  to hide himself in his kimono.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Shion Aikawa nice to meet you.&#34;</font> He would say quickly trying to make his presense evaporate without success.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: At any case...if they are given wooden weapons can i get wooden throwable ones.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) Looked to Higange Hyuuga as they shouted over the crowd for a moment before the commanding man spoke.
<font color = white>&#34;Huh...Of course, you can watch!&#34;</font> They yelled in excitement as it seemed they now had a prize.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: I'm Higane! Of the Hyuuga family, my brother is a big fan of yours!
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) yells: Miss Botan!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Haji (The black-haired boy-Wizio) says: Pathetic.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) ran up to the Chuunin with a scroll in his hands.
<font color = white>&#34;We did.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers: My pleasure Aikawa, Shion. Would you happen to have a kunai to assist me with my training... or even a bokken?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Masaki(The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (Someone drop me a single ryo pls rq u will get it back)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) takes a deep breath and sighs.

<font color = white>&#34;Is he now. I am honoured. Uhm Higane was it. Could you lower your voice a little.&#34;</font>

He looked around hoping people would continue what they were doing. He gave her a polite yet akward smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Ah, you located a listing?
<br><font color=green>*Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) says: I unfortunatly did not bring any weapons with me on my walk around the village.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) took a moment to obtain said scroll before she moved to unroll it, and thus begin to examine it. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Nicely done and in a quick fashion,&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It took a lot of work but we have Nine People for the Tournament.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: It seems to make it even, we need one more.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#008000>Kusahara (The androgenously built boy.-Dende654) takes a deep breath as he floats back from his meditation, trying to pay full attention to what's going on around him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Unless one wishes to have two matches.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) had totally forgetten all formalities after seeing such a famous individual roaming the streets. <font color = white>&#34;And a.. oop!&#34;</font> She blurped out covering her mouth instinctively.

A deep, slow and controlled bow was returned towards the much older man. <font color = white>&#34;I apologize..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I got a question
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: We even got someone to offer up some prize money.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Can we get practice weapons for this tournament?
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm? If you require weapons? I would advise they be made, till we are able to hand them out.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: 500 ryo for the winner and 250 ryo for the runner up.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Ah, good work.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I need throwable ones.
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers: Well Shion-sama, please be sure to keep me in mind. I will be needing one to assist with my progression as a masterful weaponist.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Rocks.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Use the wooden practice sets, thats my plan at least.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: One must learn to turn everything into a weapon.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) they turned around to point to the commanding man who was offering the money but they were gone</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Had hit the guy once more.He will see the nearby shuriken coming for him,instead of dodging,he decided to clash it with his own and continue moving forward.

For now he will await for anything to happen,afterall,He had the advandage of  closing up with their opponent

(clashing my shuriken with yours,moving 1 title cause i used a action besides the movement?)</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) The shuriken were clashed which was unfortunate! It caused the boy to rush towards and fling a punch towards his fellow shinobi.

<font color = white>&#34;Gaaah here&#39;s all or nothing!&#34;</font>

(E str, E agi?)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would dodge the attack afterwhich went for a punch of his own.It was weak,equally weak to his opponent,but it seemed the kid had a idea,of what to do,that is.

(2/4 dodges used,attacking with E str,and E agi)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (since is close quarters your max dodges is back to 4.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (No I did but peep)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (When I attacked with shuriken you used your attack to counter my shuriken therfore u did not attack me)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (Thus resetting your dodge bc you clashed and resetting mine bc you did not attack me)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (true,so what...you 3/4 or..1/4
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (We're both 1/4 currently)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Sotoru, Daigen(The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) OOCs: (It makes you stay on the offensive)

This type of taijutsu training would only serve to better the boy and his skills.
