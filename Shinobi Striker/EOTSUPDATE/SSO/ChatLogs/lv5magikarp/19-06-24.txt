<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) says: However, you'll need to wait until after graduation...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: D'we have any teachers in Taijutsu or Kenjutsu?
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) asks: Could i not learn under you if i promise to not use your teachings until then?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Nope!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Don't think so, Beisame, which is really annoying..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked to Sogeki as they prepared to wintness the power of the Fuuninjutsu</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) says: Oh. Oi, Cuz.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) unwraps his belt from around his middle. His robes stayed tightly around his body, perhaps something else was holding it in place.

The belt was deceivingly long, the students around him would notice. He held on to one end of the fabric while he tossed the other end forward towards Sogeki, the material seemingly stretching as it headed towards it's target.

The belt would begin to wrap around Sogeki, tightening in a second and restraining all movements but speech.

He would release the bind before it became permanent the following turn.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Hana was looking for you, you speak to her yet or nah?
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.

<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Good, good. Kick his ass good for me, that dude is annoying as hell. Rude to me all the time. I've already told Hana I'd pay her a hundred if he comes out of that fight with a hospital-worthy injury.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Yeah, I got faith in you both. I just wanna see that uppity little dick get his ass kicked.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) whispers: Thinks he's better than everyone, tch...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) As Matsu, the Hyuuga martial artist, unwrapped his deceptive belt from around his waist, Sogeki observed with a keen, calculating gaze. The fabric seemed unnaturally long, hinting at hidden abilities or techniques beyond its mundane appearance. Sogeki remained outwardly composed, though his mind analyzed the unfolding situation with meticulous detail.

As Matsu tossed one end of the belt towards him, Sogeki noted the fluid motion and the controlled extension of the fabric. The belt surged forward, the material stretching unnaturally as it closed the distance between them with surprising speed.

The fabric wrapped around Sogeki swiftly, tightening with a suddenness that restricted his movements but allowed him to speak. He felt the constricting pressure against his body, a calculated move by Matsu to assert control and limit his freedom momentarily.

Maintaining his calm demeanor, Sogeki subtly wiped his palm against his vest, smearing a thin layer of sweat from his skin onto the fabric. It was a small, tactical move—preparing himself mentally and physically for any further developments in the encounter.

While outwardly restrained, Sogeki's focus remained sharp and unwavering. His eagle-like vision scanned the surrounding area, assessing the reactions of the students and bystanders. He remained alert for any sign of aggression or opportunistic movement, his mind calculating potential threats and strategies with cool precision.

Despite the temporary restraint, Sogeki's eyes conveyed a silent warning to those around him—a reminder of his readiness to respond swiftly and decisively to any challenge. His posture remained relaxed yet poised, a testament to his training and experience as a shinobi who thrived in moments of controlled chaos.

As Matsu prepared to release the binding, Sogeki awaited the moment with a measured patience, ready to assess the situation and determine his next course of action. The encounter had tested his resolve and adaptability, reinforcing his reputation as a shinobi who navigated challenges with calculated precision and unwavering focus.</font></font></font>

He looked ready to deliver the Hyuuga's famous open palm blows. He pulled his right back back at the hip level, building momentum. However, instead of an open palm, he curled his fingers forwards resembling a grasping motion.

To those looking at his hand, they would see each finger glow a menacingly purple color in turn - starting with the pinky. In a swift strike, he would slam the fingers into the Hoshigaki's middle.

The blow did not seem to hurt the boy, he could feel something was OFF about him.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) stood statue-still as the Hyuuga approached, though as the Jounin shifted into a combative stance they instinctively tensed up, reacting to absorb the brunt of whatever blow was to strike upon their form. However...

It barely moved the Hoshigaki, simply inching them back half a stepas the shark blinked in confusion. They peered down at their body from under that large straw hat, then back up at the Hyuuga, then back down, and back up once more.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m... Not entirely sure what that did, but it did <b>something</b>.&#34;</font>, they remarked, moving their arms, their legs, rolling their neck - Something was off, but they couldn&#39;t quite figure out what just yet. Perhaps if they were better-trained, they would be able to figure it out, but for now... Just confusion.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) watched as each of the Jounin's fingers glowed with visible chakra, and their breath hitched.
The amount of chakra needed to make it visible was massive, so seeing such a feat in person was incredible and served to cement the jounin's power in their mind.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like youngster-Dilithium) offered a sharp nod, throwing their hands together in a rather slow weaving of seals, intending to utilize the Bunshin technique. However...

<font color = white>&#34;... Nothing&#39;s happening. I&#39;m <b>positive</b> I weaved them correctly... It&#39;s...&#34;</font>

Their brow furrowed for a moment, before widening in shock.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s like I can&#39;t... Mold my chakra. Something&#39;s like... I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just different.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
