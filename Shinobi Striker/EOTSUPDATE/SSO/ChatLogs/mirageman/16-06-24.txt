<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) naturally expected to not have her own ice cream melted. I mean, what kind of jerk would get their friend&#39;s ice cream before their own? Still, as Shuye took the cone, she can&#39;t help but inspect it warily. As if...

There might be a pebble in there, for some reason. If there&#39;s no indication of any oddities, she&#39;d go for a taste. A few licks leading up to a bite of the top, then a bite of the crispy waffle cone.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s ok. Do you need a napkin? Half of your icecream is on the floor.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) remained silent for a further moment and then some. How limitless is chakra even? It&#39;s not like--well, he does have a reference, though not to an explicit degree. He digs, locking his fingers together to assess the recesses of this specimen.

There&#39;s no end, none that he can familiarize, nor does it feel seperate, like before. That&#39;s where the caution came from, he concludes--his eyebrows rise up, attempting to claw his senses out of the bottomless pit he so foolishly tossed himself into.
<font color = white>&#34;Hehn-Zhaung...&#34;</font> Bottomless indeed. Finally, his eyes return out to the world about him...

He bows once again, a silent thanks for a selfimposed anxiety--he hasn&#39;t touched the surface of Mugen&#39;s strength, though he can now recognize the presence of one.
His knees give in and he stumbles into his younger sister, bumping her forward.
<font color = white>&#34;Ahi--!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) finally takes a lick out of his. It would be cruel for him to play that kind of prank on a new friend, so... while not today, one day... she just may find something like that in something he gives her. He&#39;s pretty content now that he can enjoy his ice cream as well, despite the great sacrifice he made in order to get to this point.

<font color = white>&#34;A napkin would be-&#34;</font>

But then... an accident?!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) finds himself shoved and rocks side to side in a stiff manner.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) attempts to follow Raku&#39;s vision, a gaze that might lead him right to the person he was talking about.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks over the slit eye&#39;d one&#39;s shoulder. <font color = white>&#34;Mm.&#34;</font>, he hums pointing to the iron vessel.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) got bumped into from behind. Shuye was not a very big or sturdy looking girl, so she's stumbling forward directly into the boy. It could be a disaster of calamitous proportions. Two ice creams? One of them almost melted? She yelped, lifting her ice cream hand high to protect it. Her other hand waved forward, trying to grab at anything.

Would it be his scarf? His arm? Nothing? Even if Shuye fell all the way to the ground, the ice cream would be preserved if she could help it!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (My fault og)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) watches the entire, series of events unfold, that boy was a strange one indeed. He would have to keep his eye on him.

<font color = white>&#34;He was..&#34;</font>?,the man said to nobody inparticular, before squinting at the razor lashed boy.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I think that's technically right...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes a step forward.
  <font color = white>&#34;So not real long then.&#34;</font> His eyes smile at the man.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) would've loved it if Fortune actually did favor him, even a little bit. With that sequence of events though it's unfortunate enough that the rest of his ice cream wound up getting pushed further into his face as a result of the light flailing... and with it, Shuye may find some chocolate ice cream on her hand as well, a result of the melting.

Double the pain for Venturo, though... he's got an ice cream face.

Shuye otherwise is likely more fine, aside from the bits of ice cream on her hand from her coming into contact with him so suddenly.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: . . .

She&#39;d pressed it right into his face to stop her fall. It took a second to register, and then she pulled her hand bakc and looked at it-- then looked at his stunned face. It was almost funny. She looked behind her, just in time to gather that her brother must have fallen backwards for some reason. She then looked back at her victim--

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m-- I did not do that on purpose. He-- something bumped into me.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) was a lot of things, but an evil and accusatory individual, he could not be... and fortunately, he was pretty okay! What was ice cream about to do anyways, kill him? Still, there was a tinge of sadness this scenario provides. He can no longer fully enjoy his ice cream with his friend.

He couldn&#39;t let that bother him though, and Shuye is met with a smile anyways.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, it&#39;s okay!&#34;</font> he cheers.
He&#39;s hurt.
<font color = white>&#34;I can just get another one... after I wash my face.&#34;</font>

It&#39;s not looking good for him at all. Marshmallow, chocolate ice cream, and tiny bits of nougat stick to his face as he speaks. His reputation would forever be tarnished!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) slowly looks down at his hand then toward the skies lost within blue.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) still fell, though quickly recovered due to the elder's assistance. He pulled himself forward, dusting himself off slightly while regaining some composure in his spirit. He turned around to what seemed to be a commotion he caused, though rather, something more interesting caught his eye.

Sweets, on an unidentified individual's hand. A tunnel vision wrapped around his golded hues as they dissolved to a stained darkness. Independent of any formula or focus, the boy lumbered over toward Shuye's hand before he was close enough to smell the chocolate. Melted chocolate with marshmallow? Well, the marshmallow flavoring wouldn't do him wrong, the boy is very much lactose intolerant--and Shuye should know that.

He creeps in for a bit--a lick. A lick of the white and brown display.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) rolls his shoulders about a little, looking up to the sky above it shines down upon him handsomely.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hold my ice cream, I&#39;ve got nap--&#34;</font> she began, before being interrupted by a prowling child. Shuye is much taller than him, but with both arms holding sweets he cannot have, she&#39;s force to awkwardly fight him off without being able to use either hand. 

<font color = white>&#34;Aht! Aht! No! Grab him, Venturo!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) honed in on his sister's chocolated hand--fortunately for the duo, once Meixun recognizes a sweet target, he won't acknowledge anything else. So Venturo's stickiness is null and void to any subdual required.

Unfortunately.... He's fickle and persistent when he's acquired a target.

Stretching his arms out to climb his sibling, the boy chooses to override the two-toned hair's attempts to stop him by.... Simply bulldozing past the boy, latching onto Shuye and slithering his legs around hers like an Italian 64bit Plumber climbing a png model of a Tree.</font></font></font>

   They, while recently focusing on the fine rubble below him to showcase contemplation, now slowly shifts toward the rubble nearest of his brother.

<font color = white>&#34;Catch!

Wikth her ice cream now out of her hands, she&#39;s left with no choice.

A sudden lunge forward would send all three of them spiraling into the water, preventing her lactose intolerant brother from ruining his own day for a moment of bliss.</font></font></font>

                    Instinctively, his hands raise and..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) hasn't ever seen something like that before in his life. Who let this kid get so nimble to begin with? Even worse how they were approximately the same size... where was your gusto, Venturo? Much like a tool, he is used as a buffer, and soon, it seemed he'd be sent on a ride into some watery depths. It's at some point in this whole exchange that he just accepts his fate for what it is, looking beyond the 'fourth wall' (AKA, at the three on the platform across from them) with a face that clearly asks where it all went wrong.

Into the pool, they go!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) noticed that his brother wasn&#39;t looking and moved in a race against time to grab the waffle cone.
  Taking a small bite of the food for him as a tax for saving the snack.
   <font color = white>&#34;Just making sure it&#39;s not poison.&#34;</font> Yurei said, before passing it to it&#39;s intended recipient.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) hands reach out and the cone taps against his palms. What most would&#39;ve though would be a dramatic explosion of ice cream, instead, is just the thud of the desert&#39;s edible container which plummets toward the earth inveitably breaking upon contact.

   - Or atleast that what would&#39;ve happened. 
Instead, Yurei swoops in to save the day and he slowly opens his eyes.
     <font color = white>&#34;...Thanks.&#34;</font>, he mutters with a sigh. His line of sight shifting toward the water bound group.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) attempted to scale across his sister like she were a tree, though it seems his endeavors were dutifly halted by Venturo&#39;s tool demeanor. The cretin stretched an arm amateurishly out to the slit-eyed youth, clawing at the male in an attempt to reach some form of sweetness... Only for him to be retched away by a moving Shuye!

Moments pass before Meixun renders himself conscious once again, soaked, and on top of his sister, who was in turn on top of the two-toned boy. He scratches his hair slightly, wondering why exactly he&#39;s in a body of water when he can&#39;t swim.
<font color = white>&#34;YeJii...&#34;</font> He poked his sister slightly, legs tightening up in anxiety on not knowing how deep the pool exactly was..

His voice grew harsher, though more out of worry than indignance.
<font color = white>&#34;YeJiiiiii...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) twists over to the razor-lashed boy and seems. .well, perplexed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) glances through the area as she contemplates what she should do.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Is that your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) splashed into the water, unaware of the danger that her ice cream had faced so readily-- or how it had been heroicly saved by a third party. For now, she had water shooting up her nose. She blinked the water away from her eyes and pressed her palm into the stoney walls of the moat of the arena, smearing the sweet, melted mixture until it was lost in the water around them. She didn&#39;t try to hold on to her brother, since he was so thoroughly latched on it was impossible for him to fall off.

And then, being the largest of the three, Shuye reached out to grasp at Venturo and pull him toward the wall. She&#39;d half hoist, half push him out without a word. <font color = white>&#34;Get up-- and pull us...&#34;</font> She mumbled, out of breath over the whine of her brother&#39;s voice. If Venturo complied, she&#39;d use him to help her climb out. There was probably a ninja technique that made this trivial that they all knew, being academy students, but she was a little too flustered to remember.

She almost missed Mugen&#39;s nicknaming, if his voice wasn&#39;t so boisterous and deep compared to everyone elses around here. <font color = white>&#34;Do not call me that.&#34;</font> Shuye said, perhaps a bit too sharply when speaking to an adult, but her patience was thin from her brother&#39;s antics.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: We'll when i asked ye' to tell my your name, i got no response so i took it upon myself to name you.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks at the back of his brothers head.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) seemed a little dense as a lad. . .

He&#39;s moreso thankful that he&#39;d been given the opportunity to get some of the ice cream muck off of himself, though it wouldn&#39;t be perfect given how brief the splashing was.

As he&#39;s moved toward the wall, he surely gives nod and understands absolutely what needs to be done.

Like some sort of cartoon character, he... lifts himself onto the water, using the exact technique that was taught to them in class to get onto its surface proper, all while taking hold of Shuye&#39;s forearm to assist with pulling her up too.

<font color = white>&#34;One, two...&#34;</font>

And then, a harder pull. <font color = white>&#34;Three..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Dad asked for everyone's names and people weren't paying attention so he gave them new ones and then they got mad about it.

You know you can&#39;t have any! Stick to rice candy.&#34;</font> She chastised him, before wringing out her kimono a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Zhu, Shuye. Not Candy Brain.&#34;</font> She announced to the taller Mugen, before turning toward the boy who held her icecream. She can see some is missing, but for all she knew that happened in flight. She moved closer, a hand offered.

<font color = white>&#34;Thanks for catching that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah he didn't actually eat rocks. Just a call back to earlier today...

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks down to her hand and then mindfully resists the urge to take another bite of the icecream.
  <font color = white>&#34;Are you wanting to give me more ice cream?&#34;</font> The treat is slowly risen to his face to take a lick, if even allowed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) had no desire to actually eat rocks. However, money was now on the line... He raises a hand towards the not-related red-head and calls out,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept her soaked hand outstretched.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a jolt of pain ripple through his skull, though he was too comfortable piggybacking on his sister to recognize the pain.

Wait, rice candy?! Oh.
<font color = white>&#34;Oh........Sorry.&#34;</font> He muffled into her back before raising his head to meet her still placed elbow. The pain... Oh wait she hit him.

<font color = white>&#34;Owh....&#34;</font> His delayed reaction caused him to roll off of her back and onto the ground below.</font></font></font>

With a sigh he turns back the woman and nods. Reaching out and taking the pebble from her. Staring down at it in his hand for a quiet second before tilting his hand back. The hand comes up and tosses the rock into his mouth.

A loud clacking can be heard as he repeatedly tries to bite it. After a final defiant bite, he spits it back into his hand.

<font color = white>&#34;Pthoo, nope, not possible. Worth a shot though.&#34;</font>

His free hand reaches out toward her. Beckoning her to give him his well earned ryo...</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) took her cone. There&#39;s a slight nod of approval that he didn&#39;t pilfer further from the gift she had received earlier. And all things considered, it was still not as melty as the icecream Venturo had brought for himself and ruined. She&#39;d first go for another bite of the ice cream, her teeth flashing as she chewed the coldest bits and fought off brain freeze.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s green, though.&#34;</font> She replied, playing coy while watching the pair of ice-cream safeguarding brothers with her vermillion colored eyes. She &#39;accidentally&#39; stepped on her own brother&#39;s shoulder with her sandals, too, since he was still on the ground behind her.</font></font></font>

The women reached into her lavish clothing and....produced ink and paper. She quickly writ out a letter of debt naming herself (Papiyas of clan Niwa) required to retun the sum of five ryo to the almost stone crusher of Iwa. 

It was an IOU. She passed over the paper as if it was natural. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) stares down at the IOU blankly for a long time. He was not a smart boy. Tucking the pebble into his pocket; he takes the paper in both hands and holds it up to his eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;This... doesn&#39;t look like ryo...&#34;</font>

The paper is slowly lowered. Allowing Hideo to glare at the woman from behind the IOU.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) looks towards the young man being pressed on behind Shuye with a small tilt of his head. His luck had ran dry long ago by appearances.

  <font color = white>&#34;Not what I was talking about.&#34;</font> He clarified quickly without thinking. He was instead reliving a moment in the past, pondering on how it would have felt to instead eat the entirety of the treat she had lost.

  He wasn&#39;t going to spend what little he had on ice cream.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: You're stepping on him.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Throwing a mountain huh..ive never tired it.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) the women&#39;s gaze blazed a moment. There are downsides to dealing with commoners. <font color = white>&#34;That is a letter of debt. Surely your parents have taken on debt before yes?&#34;</font> 

She held her tongue a moment....<font color = white>&#34;That is to say only a fool carries wealth on their person. A sure way to get robbed dont you think?&#34;</font> She pointed a digit at the paper. 

<font color = white>&#34;That paper will legally bind me to pay you. I would reccommendd you not lose it.&#34;</font> She smiled then at the youth <font color = white>&#34;That is unless you would rather take issue with my lack of coin now? Spilled blood to wash debts aside?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept her foot where it was, thinking about how to respond--

<font color = white>&#34;Oh.&#34;</font> 

She moved her foot then, and looked down at her brother. <font color = white>&#34;Why are you still on the floor? I didn&#39;t hit you that hard.&#34;</font> She mumbled, before turning her attention on the boys, and deciding upon a nonsequitor.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Shuye.&#34;</font> They&#39;d probably heard. <font color = white>&#34;But I missed who you guys are, other than something about -- mugen?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) got up without a second word, she must be satisfied now--right? Yeah, right.
He wrings out the girl's sleeves while she converses, just to soften any hard feelings left behind of course.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) looks between the paper, and over his shoulder toward his father. Despite the boys passion for getting money his family was actually really well off. But he had no idea if they had ever messed with debts at all.

Finally looking back to the woman he sighs. Stuffing the IOU into his pocket as he mumbles,

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sure you&#39;re good for it...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Hello Shuye.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) smiles thrice given the shape of his eyes. It feels as though all he&#39;s been talking about of late was his name.

  <font color = white>&#34;Mugen, Yurei. A-and my brother. He&#39;s here too.&#34;</font> The juxtaposition of him and his sibling felt congruent in energy, yet their looks differed slightly. . .
As if only having one same parent.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) face twitched. No matter.....<font color = white>&#34;You will get your ryo I assure you. I would not so easily burn a comrades trust when I will rely on them one day to see my ambitions soar.&#34;</font> 

She went to go and sit at the water&#39;s edge, tucking a single leg under her and letting the other dangle off the edge as she placed her chin in her palm and sighed. 

<font color = white>&#34;Still a match of wrestling would soothe this boredom I am sure. Has anyone seen the sumo battle before? What a sight.&#34;</font> She day dreamed aloud.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Hm... The sibling characters differ in appearance, YeJii.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I 'unno... I don't think most people present would be good at that.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) steps forward sub-consciously as the word &#39;Brother&#39; had been announced. No matter how aloof he&#39;d found himself in the situation he eventually pulled his focus toward the two infront of him by the simple redirection of his gaze.
 
   <font color = white>&#34;Mugen, Raku.&#34;</font>, he calls out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: It is not about being good at it. But the mere act of trying that sets us mortals apart. As you have shown already, daring a feat the rest of us feared.  
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hehe, well, that's just how I am. Destined for greatnesss...
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: I will keep an eye on your rise. Persons of action shall rule this world

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) let her brother wring out the lingering water in the fabric. She was hiding it pretty well, but it was cold out here in wet clothes. She started to shiver and took another bite of her ice cream, nearly done with it now as it was mostly a waffle cone with a little bit of matcha instead of the other way around now. She reached a hand over to her brother and gently palmed his head reassuringly. Compared to her and Meixun, they didn&#39;t look as similar as they ought to. She turned her head toward the six armed albino girl and tucked her chin slightly, acknowledging her greeting and returning it non verbally.

Shuye didn&#39;t piece it together, though.

<font color = white>&#34;So what kind of ninja are you going to be?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: But you eat rocks..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks upward toward the sky. In constrast to his brother the question seemed to push him into a daydream indusive train of thought.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) flicked the last of the waffle cone into her mouth, the crunching of it into dust as loud as any spoken word.

Handseals are weaved, until the girl transformed into a spitting image of the slit-eyed youth as she slowlyl manuevered towards the tree. That way if it charged her, it&#39;d gore the wood, and not a person.

During his contemplations, he used those sharp eyes of his to search the creature for any labels, either seared on by Brand, or hanging off it by tag, that might suggest who the cow belonged to.

<font color = white>&#34;Huh.  I wonder...  Reilin...  I want steak or hamburger dinner...&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt a rise of bloodlust in the bull's eyes, it was on a rampage; following silently behind his sibling and fellow youth, Meixun arrives to seeing his sister transform right in front of him!

Oh, that's what he's fell behind on knowing--the basics. Well, no matter, there's some things you just have to have a knack for before you can begin. What he can do in the meantime... Is dig.

He positions himself directly behind Shuye's disguised form, and... Sits down, legs and arms crossed he sits on the grassy terrain. His eyes lid to a shut, forcing himself the embue the surrounding motions for a time. Even if there isn't any spike in chakra on the animal, he could atleast anticipate the severity of the being's strike.

That is, if he's able to annouce it in a timely manner for those targeted to react.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) As several people being to act, the instinctual beast does what he must do. He sees everyone around him as a threat to his position as the head breeding bull back at Ram Ranch.

With that he explodes forth towards the slit eye'd kid with incredible speed, not even noticing the replica formed by the girl alongside him. His intention was to ram his head directly into the kid's mid-section, but at the last moment he saw the copy that had been made and pulled up. This resulted in him simply plowing through the kid and luckily not trampling him.

The bull then examines the area for his next target.

(Light injury to Yurei, having bull roll for next target.)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) steps back. He didn&#39;t see the need to get too close to the beast as is. Still, seeing such a rage filled animal charge down his kin and them jump into action was rather interesting.

   <font color = white>&#34;Be careful, brother. It seems dangerous.&#34;</font>, he obviously stated.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was keeping its attention entirely on how the bull maneuvered, since it was an animal--obviously its signature wasn't to fluctuate as explicitly as a human's. Though the location bias helped exponentially. Meixun's brow furrows slightly, recognizing that it was attacking Yurei's signature. Meaning that it would be vulnerable to any sort of sudden attack by those who were willing to do so.

Despite his lack of direct interaction with the current situation... Meixun is wearing red... Crimson red.

A crimson red silk shirt, still glistening from the time he was partially submerged in the water--if the bull desired to attack anything red? Well.
But Meixun isn't aware of this mythos just yet, primarily due to his sensory form, he continues to mark the animal's movements, waiting for a moment of opportunity to arise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Massive Bull (The restored one-Kristuria) In this moment the bull was drawn to the clones produced by the transformed girl. They...spoke to him in an unnatural way that beckoned him to them.

A sharp turn is made and an explosion of strength ensues as the raging beast charges directly towards the clone of the girl.

Upon reaching the clone the bull simply runs <u></u>right through it<u></u> and slams into the mountain with tremendous force just as the attempt to mount the animal was made. The impending shockwave forcefully dismounts Yure.

The bull; however, at this point is jarred by his collision with the mountain and takes no further action this turn.</font></font></font>

  It was something further beyond. The environment sustained damage, people ran, but by the looks of it the bull had been clocked by it&#39;s own explosive power.

 Hearing the words of his brother, he clenched the green blades of grass and took a stand.
  <font color = white>&#34;Feelin&#39; dizzy?&#34;</font>

  Yurei would run forwards to drive home a flying drop kick to the bull&#39;s face, just like he&#39;d read about in books.</font></font></font>

He was not going to give that creature a chance to charge him. He remained within the tree&#39;s canopy, watching the others do with the bull as they pleased. It seems no one had the means to secure it, so violence was probably the only option. Its owner should have kept a tighter leash on their livestock. They have no right to complain. Not after their lack of precautions set this dangerous creature loose on the population&#39;s common folks.

From his spot in the tree, the Marksman pitched a palm-sized stone or two at the bull&#39;s crown, looking to disorient it further. He&#39;s skilled enough to avoid hitting anyone other than his target. Especially with the Bull sitting stationary. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) had managed to lure the beast! She perfectly executed her plan, and the resounding thud and crash of stone and horn particulate that echoed through the park from its impact filled her with a sense of pride. However, Shuye knew that this was now beyond her abilities. She'd given what she could.

She tucked her hands into her kimono like a character on the victory screen as Yurei -- and potentially others-- went to deliver the knock out blow.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) felt the animal's chakra wane significantly, indicating the animal was properly bested. The boy comitted the feeling to memory--should something similar occur with someone of more active circumstances. Regardless of his participation; he felt his pocket become a slight bit fatter once the group was rewarded.

Staring at the boon, he walked over to his sister, handing her the majority. What does he need money for? He can't do much with it, that's Shuye's job anyhow.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) checked over her brother to make sure he was not hurt-- and, oh yeah, dispelled the illusion. Being a boy was weird. She received his gift, and nodded.

<font color = white>&#34;Exicting, dìdì?&#34;</font> She asked him. She touched her pocket to pull a rice candy, only to remember that their spill in the water would have surely ruined it. Oops.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) goes to hit the ground for cover, but is far too late. The kick landing square into his chest and plummeting him into the ground by surprise.

He had been daydreaming. <font color = white>&#34;Ahh! Watch it!&#34;</font> He manages to cry out before he eats dirt</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) already was munching on the soggy balls of sweetness before she even gave tijme to consider handing it to him. He nodded softly, pulling the connective stick from his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;.............&#34;</font> He was very obviously speaking, though atop of his already whispy voice and the fact that his mouth was full, it was unintelligible.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) takes hold of the cash loosely offered to him. He then falls into thought.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) lands on the ground and then stomps in around the boy&#39;s body to get closer to them.
  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry, I think I got caught up with the bull.&#34;</font> He said sincerely, aiming to help them up with a hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail red-eyed boy-Jessinator) grits through his teeth, but couldn’t hold no ill-will towards his fellow peer. His thin arm reaches up to take hold so he can be hoisted back up.

Afterwards he dusts himself off and bows towards the other. <font color = white>&#34;Ehhh...no harm done, really. Thanks for the lift up. I’m Kenzo of the Uchiha&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) nods his head, he&#39;d just kicked down a member of a more noble clan than his own. Yurei took account of it, although it didn&#39;t seem to alter his reactions any.

  <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Mugen, Yurei. Since that&#39;s handled I&#39;m gonna head back towards the north-eastern side of the village.&#34;</font> He stated before muttering something softly to himself.

  <font color = white>&#34;<i>What a way to meet someone. . .</i>&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Mm. A careless Rancher came by and paid us for all the trouble they caused.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) waves after Yurei, debating on passing along what just happened to him. But they seemed to actually be sorry, a true and honest mistake.

  <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t go taking any notes from me then.&#34;</font> He said with a light smile of his eyes.
  <font color = white>&#34;You can be my friend, and my brother Raku&#39;s if he takes to you.&#34;</font> Yurei followed with a nod towards direction of the taciturn one.

<br><font color=green>*Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) asks: Yeah?

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font color=red>*Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) increases their chakra by Full - 9 / 9.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes now laid on the razor-lashed one.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b6936f>Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) rubbed her nose a few times, looking at the rest of the group that'd gathered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) suddenly felt embarassed, her usually quiet brother quite loud and speaking in a tongue most of these people had never heard before. It was harsh, tonal. She looked to her brother, and the word she uttered is only one; easy to understand.

<font color = white>&#34;Mugen?&#34;</font>

She then turned toward Raku. <font color = white>&#34;--It&#39;s how we talk at home.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiyoru (The short bashful girl-DcNite) says: You're right, that wasn't easy to explain at all.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) nodded in confirmation, though Shuye's divided attention forced the boy to follow suit. He didn't get the memo that others were attempting to understand what the duo was saying--only choosing to glare as per usual, wondering if there was something he said which meant something different in their language.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) rubbed his face.
  <font color = white>&#34;Still not sure how to feel about that.&#34;</font> He suffered with feeling tied to that red-headed man in some purposeless way.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) shakes his head and rubs his eyes, bringing himself temporarily back to life. He shuffles in his position and heads next to the six armed boy.

Without saying too much, he waves</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) gaze lingers on the Zhu&#39;s for a prolonged moment before he looks to his brother. <font color = white>&#34;You missed the bull earlier.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Mama is still somewhere YeJii! I feel her spirit circumstantially!
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Yeah, yeah, don't rub it in. I missed twice.
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) whispers: I don't think that means what you think it means.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm.. You should read more books.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I've learned a lot in the schools library.
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: . . . You are using the stronger tongue... Why?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Eh. I don't wanna hang around here anymore
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I'll go there now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) eyes narrow ever so slightly indicating he&#39;d gained some form of contentment from his brother&#39;s words.
   <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll meet you. I&#39;ll be studying Chinese.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: --
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: We can head back.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) cocked his head at Shuye's reaction, whatever Raku said--it's not what they call themselves, so he wasn't at all familiar with the term.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) moved off from the area and towards the library.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: How're things you all?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: 'Kay I guess.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Fine.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Hi.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Think Raku's still asleep.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Is anyone training today?
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Nay right now, clearly.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'm more a book reader than a trainer.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Books are a good way of training the mind.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Likewise.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) was in fact, reading right in this moment, holding a book in one hand, and scribbling notes on a little pad with the other. All while sitting dangerously on the edge of the moat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I'm done with my meat-cutting for the day, I was hopin' to get into somethin' less dull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) walked up behind the white-haired person, peeping in to see what they were reading without invading their personal space.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: Are you the son of a butcher?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn&#39;t appear to care much for the approaching youth, and simply continued to study. It quickly became apparent she was was reading about everyone&#39;s favourite topic of treatment methods for various kinds of fungal infections. In this particular instance, stomach infections, and all the not-so-pleasant symptoms, and how to quell them.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Fraid ah ain&#39; known t&#39;be much fun.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) shook his head, medical studies were an interesting topic. He began to see different roots praised for their antifungal properties and ailments which could be caused by an infectious encounter with them.
 Truth be told, he had no real idea what he was looking at, but caught the gist.

   Turning around to face north he speaks out while sitting on the ground.
<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s like a general goods man, has his hands in different things. Some of the meat will go to our home, some will be sold.&#34;</font> Yurei describes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) didn't look particularly happy with the topic, but what could she do. Hunkering down, and learning it was a simple requirement if she wanted to excel, even if studying definitely wasn't a fun occasion for her.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) crossed her arms. She thought about whether to keep asking him things about it, but instead shared about herself--

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m a vegetarian.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: So what you eat plants?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Well, not just plants. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: ...Actually, yes, just plants. I guess fruit are technically from plants. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) wrinkled her nose as the dust storm rolled on in, and called it a day for studying.

<font color = white>&#34;...Oughta get a pair o&#39; goggles.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: .... so dujsty.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: I get it, does it get boring?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Ugh, my eyes.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Not to me! You can use a lot of different toppings.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) looked distant--

<font color = white>&#34;You don&#39;t want to know what too much meat does to you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) shields himself from the raging dust and begins to make his way off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) returns, equipped with a straw hat on his head and another in hand. In a swift motion he'd look to offer the other to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes the hat and then places it on top of his head to wall the dust from his face.
  <font color = white>&#34;Thanks, Raku, what a surprise.&#34;</font> He stated with a smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) nods and parts his lips to speak once more.
  <font color = white>&#34;I spoke to a higher-up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Did they give you orders to get us hats?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: They said we may have the power to surpass the Shogun.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: The Mugen clan is that strong?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I'm not sure..
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Are we a clan?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Kind of, but kind of not.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: To be able to surpass the Shogun, you'd have to be stronger than strong.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Why would you even want to do that? 
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: i kinda like the idea of peace area to meet other people in the future.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Not real sure.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I feel like the Shogun is one-hundred years old.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I was told that even he can bleed.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: And just as energy recycles, so does power.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I don't think I want power, Yurei.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) nuzzled his mouth lower into the collar of his hoodie as the dust storm raged across the village. Just another day in Iwagakure.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: M'gonna be back'n a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Don't really get it myself. Maybe they were talkin' about the village, or themselves.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) kneaded some chakra in his mouth before opening his lips and depositing a golden coin-shaped object. He began flicking it between all thirty fingers.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: It storms quite a bit...it's really annoying. I can't see shit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) shot a quick glance at his peers talking before shrugging and returning to his coin.

<font color = white>&#34;We have to be comfortable in it. If we&#39;re used to it, our enemies will have quite a hard time attacking us here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What if they wear goggles?
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Doubt they could even make it through the front door.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Thank god it's over...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hello, hello.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) head flicks upward as the sandstorm subsides. <font color = white>&#34;Mm..&#34;</font>, he hums to himself as he&#39;d became lost in thought.

   <font color = white>&#34;Library.&#34;</font>, is all he says to his brother.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How's it goin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) uses a line of twine to rope the straw hat to his backside before heading west after a while.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Ooh.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hmm, I myself will be using Katon, shurikenjutsu and well I haven't thought of anything else just yet
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: Shurikenjutsu sounds like a great place to start.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I just wants swords, man.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Using kenjutsu would be a lot of fun but I can't really spread myself too thin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Yeah, fair enough. I dunno how much I'll use ranged weapons anyways. I prefer to get close to my enemies.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Well that's good to know, if we ever go on any missions together that is.
<br><font color=green>*Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) says: Damn kdis
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Eh?

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, must be nose blind.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Sticks her tongue out at the old man.

I am not a man or a guy, I am frankly surpised someone as old as you is still alive..&#34;</font> She groaned, before turning her attention to her brother. The girl moved over towards his side. <font color = white>&#34;Hey nii-san.&#34;</font> She said standing before him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Wha'cha doin' here, Gramps?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: He's probably here to visit a tailor.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) watches with amusement as his younger sister roasts the strange old man. As she approaches, he reaches out and moves to lightly karate chop her. Tapping her head with his hand as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Hey Himeki. Who&#39;s the old guy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Narusari, Yuu (The old merchant-MyG) mumbles, <font color = white>&#34;Damn snot nosed brats,&#34;</font> to himself before closing his eyes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) Blinked a few times as she shifted her attention towards him. She had gently grabbed his hand.

<font color = white>&#34;What ya doing? And I have no idea, he seems rude.&#34;</font> She had said before saying.

<font color = white>&#34;Another game of 200?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Himeki(The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) OOCs: (And buying my first core)

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Rest well, Gramps.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm, if you need anything mister let us know.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I'm not doing anything yet. Pretty quiet morning so far. Did dad give you more money to bet with? Cause I was serious yesterday! Tired of playing two-hundred and betting with cool rocks...

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: No
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Hey, Kaido. How're you doin'?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) flicked the sticky coin he had produced across his fingers once more, taking in the situation quietly with a wandering violet gaze. A dark eyebrow would be raised at the grumpy old merchant.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) nods at Rellin and lets out a huge sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhh I&#39;m doing pretty good you know. Getting better, going to be the greatest in my specialization one day heh. How are you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) begins counting his ryo over, becoming increasingly proud of his earnings.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) finally removes his hand from atop her head and stuffs it into his pocket. Sighing as he says,

<font color = white>&#34;Then we&#39;re not gonna play two-hundred. Rolling dice just to roll dice isn&#39;t fun...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: yI need to make some money, who's got some?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: *I*
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I'll give you 100 ryo if you give me 200 ryo.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Momochi, Subject One (The deployed pawn-Guest-3114561765) eyes panned between the collective. Silently observing his soon to be peers as the intereact with one another and form indepenent fractions. At this moment all he required was some form of indication of who was in charge. He wasn't sure if the village had an active chuunin nor Jounin.

But it was probably wise to keep a close eye on every's attire. Maybe there he'd be able to parse out the officials from the crowd.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances at the light purple haired girl.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re not even pretty enough to talk to, go make me a sandwhich.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) twirled her hair around her index finger idly while she conversed. <font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s good to hear. I think I&#39;ll be the best in mine as well. Make sure you don&#39;t fall behind.&#34;</font> she said with a light chuckle.

<font color = white>&#34;Care to share what your specialization will be, or are you one of the people who like to keep secrets?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll keep it a secret for now!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) raised an eyebrow at the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Why would I do anything for you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Man, secrets are lame. Isn't she supposed to be your wife or whatever too? That's gonna be a tough marriage...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) glances back at the girl.

<font color = white>&#34;Why wouldn&#39;t you? You&#39;ve got two hands and I forgot to do the dishes at home. Chop chop!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: I'll tell you in private later Rellin!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Eh, pay me 100 ryo and I'll do it.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Happy wife happy life.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I was just saying that before, you're not pretty enough to pay.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: You should be happy I'm even talking to you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Really? I think she's pretty pretty.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Then marry her.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Nah, I gotta get rich and famous first. Maybe later.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: How are you going to get famous?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Throwing mountains at people.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) gave a thumbs up at Hideo before looking at the other boy before.

<font color = white>&#34;If you&#39;re not gonna pay me, I won&#39;t do anything for you, simple as.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) quickly returns the thumbs up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Darn, I coulda had a maid..
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) asks: ...Anyone even got cash 'sides what we earned from the race?
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Why would you want an ugly maid? Get your priorities straight before you get cash.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I'll through you at people.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) shaked her head.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She totally did...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Yeah. Is that supposed to be a good amount?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Ayyo, lemme hold wo hunnid ryo.

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrm.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: How far away am I from a sword? That's all I care about.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: Kinda want to play again
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) says: For double the money
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I missed the games.

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: 'Bout, like, two-thousand-somethin'.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Fuck. Well, I'll get there one day.
<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Fer a small one.

<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I just had the strong urge to rob someone.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: But that would be wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Very wrong.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah man robbing people is messed up.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Unless it's like, part of a mission. Then it's pretty cool.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) perks up from the scroll he was lazily perusing through.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) says: MM that reminds me... I meant to go shopping earlier.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) flicked the synthetic golden coin behind him.

<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Sounded like someone was crunching on dry ramen just now.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Himeki (The-little-red-afro-girl-AngelofDeath642) asks: Sorry anyone want to play 200?

<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I think my luck needs recharging for a few years.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) reached into one of her pouches, and withdrew... A protein bar? The unhealthy honey, and chocolate-brand.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Nyaka (The blonde haired trickster-HandsForAll) witnessed a plethora of individuals filing into the academy. Streamers hung from the burgundy walls. Exhilarated, the trickster leaped onto a sizable black crate, flailing both hands into the sky with an electrifying smile. A Velcro harness was easily distinguishable around his hips, with a blue and red streamer attached to it.

Pointing at an overhead light, he turned it on.

<font color = white>&#34;LET THE FUN BEGIN!&#34;</font> The trickster declared, his voice projecting throughout the entire academy. Hoping the dramatic scene kept onlookers quiet, an explanation was provided.

<font color = white>&#34;Today, all the people present will indulge in a fun game I call-&#34;</font>

The trickster didn&#39;t anticipate a name for this proposed activity. Terror filled his eyes as humiliation loomed. To make a good first impression, the trickster&#39;s brain kicked into overdrive. With confidence, mediocre names could be made superb!

Snapping at the crowd, he announced, 
<font color = white>&#34;NINJA VELCRO BELT!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ninja Velcro Belt is a simple game where two streamers are attached to the belts. In battle, a single blow can be crippling or debilitating. Evading and securing your own deadly attacks are the most important skills to learn as a ninja. Skills mean nothing without the capacity to execute them!&#34;</font> The trickster explained.

<font color = white>&#34;Lose both streamers? You&#39;re dead... figuratively.&#34;</font>

To give a representation, the proctor of Ninja Velcro Belt grabbed both streamers and yanked them off with a little force, going cross-eyed as if signifying a blood-curdled final breath.

<font color = white>&#34;The rules of engagement are simple: you are not to cause harm to any participant, and you are not allowed to regain your lives. Other than that...?&#34;</font>

Both streamers that were previously tethered to the trickster free-fell as he clasped his hands together with a lit-up expression, making one final statement and remark.

<font color = white>&#34;IT&#39;S A TOTAL FREE-FOR-ALL!&#34;</font>

With that, Iwagakure&#39;s trickster hopped off the black crate, opening it to reveal sets of black Velcro belts and streamers ready for attachment.

(This game follows normal combat rules, securing a strike is equivalent to dealing a SINGULAR step of injury.  All participants have a injury cap of two.)
(Battles will occur all over the academy, to join a ongoing battle one must wait three turns, then start five tiles away from any participating member of the encounter.)
(Loss of a streamer persists through battles..)
(Battles are capped at four participants, when one falls a spectator who&#39;s waited the required time may hop in.)
(Spectators of battles who&#39;re waiting to join the encounter, are liable to being attacked by other players.)
(This game is strictly CQC, no throwing tools)
(Questions will be answered at any time by the protector)
(Last but not least, try to keep RP&#39;s short and sweet.. Have fun!)</font></font></font>

It was unusual, something he wasn&#39;t used to, but truthfully it did sound a little fun. It was a raw test of agility and not much else.

  <font color = white>&#34;Seems like it&#39;ll be based mostly on chance if you make it to the end. I&#39;m game for a little flag tag.&#34;</font> He leans off the wall.</font></font></font>

Grabbing a belt and affixing the little streamers to the velcro spots on the belt.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright! I&#39;m gonna win- Wait how do we win this game? Do we collect a bunch of flags?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Another game to play, honestly she was currently not a fan of these kinds of games...    Or well, games in general after the one earlier thus she was currently trying to decide to she should take part in this or not.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm...  Choices.&#34;</font>

She whispered to herself softly.  Though she would find herself having a question.

<font color = white>&#34;Um.  If we capture other peoples flags.  Do they count towards our life or just shows we eliminated people?&#34;</font>

This was important.  If it counted towards one&#39;s life, then those who were agile would win.  If it didn&#39;t then those who formed groups and ganged up on others would win...</font></font></font>

The trickster's repetitve instruction echoed throughout the halls, surrounded by the voice of his comradery--essentially, it seemed to be a battle royale of sorts.

A crabby voice caught his attention, recognizing that as his sister-- waved and pointed toward the collection of connecitve belts assigned. Seeing as everyone was taking one, he assumed it was only right for him to grab onto one as well. He bowed to the trickster, took himself a belt, made his way further into the building--shooting a leer at the new Kunoichi in between Cho'Kuome and Mugen. No time to recognize her signature at the moment...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) began to walk forward with belt in hand.

For some inexplainable reason he felt weird jumping someone in a bathroom. But it was, technically, in the name of the game! So he got over it pretty quickly. He wasn&#39;t sure if the prize was money or not but winning in of itself was pretty cool.

<font color = white>&#34;Technically he never said it&#39;d disqualify us- Just to not do it intentionally!&#34;</font>

He calls out as he steps forward and around the side of Yurei. Reaching out, he tries to swipe for one of the flags around the boys waist.

[1/4]
  Directly afterwards, he would grab the belt off the chubby boy completely making his pants fall from his waist in a quick unrecoverable fashion.

  <font color = white>&#34;Why don&#39;tcha sit this one out, big guy. You aren&#39;t makin&#39; it.&#34;</font> He said with a smile.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Damn, that was pretty cool...&#34;</font>

He unknowingly mutters a stream of consciousness to his opponent. Eyes darting to Gosu as he watches his comrade get taken out so quickly. It seemed neither of them were really made for this sort of event...

<font color = white>&#34;Raaah! I still have to try! To push past my limits!&#34;</font>

He quickly pushes himself back up to his feet. Mimicking Yurei&#39;s earlier movement by leaping forward as soon as he was grounded. Snatching one of his opponent&#39;s flags in response!

Triumphantly waving it through the air he retorts,

<font color = white>&#34;I mean- This is kinda fun, yeah! Winning doesn&#39;t really matter to me when money isn&#39;t on the line!&#34;</font>

Looking at the flag... He ponders if he can just attach it to his own belt and restore his missing one... Eventually shaking his head and simply backing up toward the door. Streamer secured, time to flee!

Throwing himself to the right in an attempt to avoid the attack. Only to basically slam himself into the wall.

Taking a deep breath in an attempt to recover, he continues fleeing! This wasn&#39;t a fight he would win... He needed to try and get someone else involved...

Completely ignoring the fact that Kusa had slipped into the bathroom a little bit ago. He wasn&#39;t especially observant.

Before looking over his shoulder and grinning at Yurei.

He raises his foot up against the door frame of the bathroom and kicks off it! Leaping backwards! In a completely mundane way though. Just enough effort to evade the swipe for a final time... He was surely done for after this...

There nothing more that the red head could do but put his hands up.<font color = white>&#34;Shit.. what ya gonna do..?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-ah it finished
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) asks: or not?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Seems like a party.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) said as she looked up from her clipboard. She was...working on administrative notes!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shirogane, Kusanari (The nonchalant green eyed boy-Arkus789) says: Not yet Koume sensei..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) followed him outside of the bathroom door, yanking him backwards by the belt in order to reel him back in like a fish that had pulled the bait too far out.
  <font color = white>&#34;Where you think you&#39;re goin&#39;, nincompoop?&#34;</font>

There was an aura of focus around him, as if this was just an excellent game that he enjoyed so thoroughly that his state had been altered. Kicking off Hideo&#39;s back, Yurei would aim to secure the very last streamer.

  <font color = white>&#34;N&#39; that&#39;s that.&#34;</font> He said with closed eyes and a sharp smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) flops onto the ground with a chuckle. At least he secured a single streamer... That&#39;s a win in his book. Given that money wasn&#39;t on the line-

<font color = white>&#34;Man- How many times do I gotta say my name&#39;s Hideo...&#34;</font>

He mumbles before climbing back to his feet and dusting himself off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Utsuwa, Hideo.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Maybe we can be friends too.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Hey- Oh you got it right.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Oh for sure man! You're pretty strong.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: I read.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) holds up his pants, a frown on his face</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I just kinda stumble around lookin' for stuff to do. We'll figure out stuff to do together later!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Gosu, you know if we're supposed to wait in the lobby now or what?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Not sure
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) memorizes the plump youth's name as well, trying not to hold the fact that he aimed to hurt him against him.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) asks: Who's left?
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: seems so
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Huh, guess we'll head back and figure it out from there!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Good luck Yurei.
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) says: Mhm, thanks.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) held their ribbon in hand. Torn as the one he primarily chopped through. A moment&#39;s taken to secure that one from the ground as well. And then? He tied them to his belt. 

After which, he bids them a respectful yet slight bow of head.
<font color = white>&#34;Impressive? Please. I&#39;m still learning. We&#39;ve both got a long way to go, but I look forward to where we&#39;ll end up. But thank you nonetheless.&#34;</font>

She was of refined attitude, he determined, which was a pretty fair measure of one&#39;s future value. So says his outlook. Only the foolish and vain would make a big deal out of something like this little class. 

<font color = white>&#34;I look forward to the drink too. Just don&#39;t poison me or something. My Father would piss on my grave if he found out I didn&#39;t listen to his warnings about Kunoichi tactics.&#34;</font>

A soft little chuckle muffled from beneath his mask. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Tsuchigumo, Okuno (The boy with many arms-T0r1x) rounded the front row of desk and continued his pursuit after identifying the real girl. A smile graced his lips as Tsuneko made the first strike.

<i>Yes! Now we have her!</i> he thought, adrenaline filling his body. The flag was his!

Okuno swiped several arms at Himeki, trying to take her flag.

(E+ striking agi)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Tsuchigumo, Okuno(The boy with many arms-T0r1x) OOCs: (i have to head soon anyways probably)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) would slap Himeki&#39;s hand away as she moves to grab at her flag once more!

<font color = white>&#34;Boo!&#34;</font>

She states to try and spook her once more as she noticed her cousin closing in on himeki from behind!

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry about this though...&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) takes some time to scan the room to view everyone's streamers.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Yurei(The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) OOCs: (everyone can just state oocly how many)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i got 2 tho im fiighting meixun rn)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chonamu(The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) OOCs: (I got two)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) [1/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) couldn't have made it any more convenient if he attempted it himself. Suddenly, having his hair pulled gave him the staunch opportunity to...

Hug Fubuki. No, really--an embrace... In the middle of their fight. 
Both of Meixun's hands were locking fingers while behind Fubuki's back tightly, his legs followed suit and before long, he was being backpacked--or frontpacked--by the elder teen. The child's facade of a simple hug dissolved by the time his legs wapped around hers--it's archaic, juvenile more accurately, but it was a grapple nonetheless. The best way to circumvent a stalemate? Make it stale.

In reality he was pitting strength against strength, seeing how much time it took before he was snatched off of her and back into the fray of battle. Also, it'd give him time to recognize any... 
Final stands should things get iffy in the process..

[Grapple, I still dk entirely how the priority goes or if it reqs breaking Def to succeed so fuck it we ball]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (dw, fuck it we ball is also my strategy)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (i just realized, do our defensive returns reset after this lol)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (thas what I'm guessing lol)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (oh god is there a cooldown to this)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (i rly think I gotta break DT in order for it to succeed, if not I jus force a disengage ig)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (oh yeah we can also just disengage and run from every fight...this event might've not been as well planned perhaps lol)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (depends rly, iss supposed to be ffa so even if I run or you run someone else could grip you)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (or me)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (yeah i suppose)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) &#39;s hand reached out towards his belt until her arm couldn&#39;t extend anymore. She couldn&#39;t move her arm - most of her body in fact couldn&#39;t be moved. Fubuki needed a moment to realize she was getting hugged by the kid - thankfully it was a grapple technically so she didn&#39;t even need to be embarrassed about it. It was basically impossible to break out of so yet neither of them could reach for the other&#39;s streamer, so it was some sort of stalemate. She sighed, and spoke as he latched on to her. 

<font color = white>&#34;As much as I like fighting you, there&#39;s no way we&#39;ll ever end our fight properly. Especially with how many people surround us. You wanna go after anyone else, together?&#34;</font>

Of course she struggled so eventually Meixun would be forced to stop grappling her.

[Grappled so I can&#39;t do anything this turn]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) [2/3]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Mn....&#34;</font> The boy shuffled himself to the teen&#39;s side, gaining a better view of the surroundings. Someone was arriving soon--very soon, if they came in by now then they&#39;d more than likely take sides with the currently present Chonamu. A top of things, if they decided to work together.... Given that they both move rather similarly, it could prove to be advantageous in strategizing...

He stretches his neck toward the girl&#39;s ear for a whisper, continuing to hold his grasp.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) lowered herself so the boy would be closer to her ear - she whispered back.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) As the two shinobi in training formulated thier plan. Chonamu's Loud heavy breathing would seemingly stop as he could be seen  bouncing up and down he was primed to strike.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Akimichi, Chonamu(The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) OOCs: ( Me rn )

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Mhm!&#34;</font> The boy eagerly replied, flipping over the girl, placing himself behind.
A moment of time passes before he finally discovers who the new arrival turns out to be:

It&#39;s Yurei, the other Mugen sibling; from what he could gather from sensing the slit eye&#39;d boy&#39;s battle with the rogue bull--he also works with Taijutsu, unknown to what degree however.
An Akimichi and a Taijutsu specialist, however this event will unfurl, it&#39;s best to assume nothing will come swimmingly.
He steels himself, taking action to dash first at Chonamu, regardless of how Yurei acts: he sticks to the plan.
