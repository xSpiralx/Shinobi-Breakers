<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Sakuya (The praying girl-MoreLife) Sakuya sat in the back of the academy classroom, her eyes attentively scanning the blackboard. The teacher was explaining the intricacies of chakra control, doodling concentric circles and arrows to represent flow and balance. Most of her classmates looked like they were on the verge of snoozing, but Sakuya was intrigued.

As the teacher droned on, a paper airplane glided through the air and landed on her desk. She unfolded the paper discreetly, reading the hastily scribbled message: <font color = white>&#34;This is so boring! Wanna sneak out and practice some real jutsu?&#34;</font>

A small smile curled on Sakuya&#39;s lips. She glanced at the sender, her eyes meeting the mischievous gaze of her classmate, Kaito. He was a skilled ninja for his age, but always in search of shortcuts.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: So kicks are stronger than punches, right?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Because we walk around all day on our legs.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: But if we walked on our hands then our punches would be strong.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: So I do both!

<font color = white>&#34;But, doesn&#39;t that mean... overall, your kicks would still be weaker? You don&#39;t give them one-hundred percent of your effort, as you usually would! But there&#39;s a trick to this...&#34;</font> There was?</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stares at Hajime with widened eyes, but, thankfully, doesn&#39;t lean any closer. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s be friends!

<font color = white>&#34;Uchiha, Yuuto. I&#39;m sure you heard Batsu&#39;s name as well. Seems like it&#39;ll be three of us on the academy this year, I thought there would be at least four.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) would cross both arms ahead of herself as she watched the intense youth talking down upon the bright one. There was a growing smile of amusement which tugged at the corners of her lips.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I don&#39;t know about you calling to everyone,&#34;</font> she directs to the redhead, <font color = white>&#34;I know I&#39;m above academy standards. I already know how to perform stuff,&#34;</font> she bragged.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Oh! 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: A match already?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I want to learn as many jutsu as possible, but I don't want to slack in other areas either.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) wipes an imaginary tear from her eye.

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I guess I'll start out as a generalist.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: A generalist.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Very cool! 
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: I'm gonna be a medical ninja!
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: What about you?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Really?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: I bet I have really good chakra control.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Are you sure you want to try that?
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You don't hear that often.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Sakuya Senju (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya rises from the wooden park bench, feeling the muscles in her back and arms unfurl like blossoms greeting the morning sun. She stretches her arms high above her head, her fingers reaching toward the overcast sky, as if trying to touch the clouds. 

"I should make friends now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: No, I'm just kidding.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: HA HA HA.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) extends her hand with a blaring smile. <font color = white>&#34;Shake on it!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I was gonna say..You don't look that impressive.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: What!
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Look at me!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Ah, right. I'll add that in. I forgot medical shinobi were a thing, SINCE I NEVER NEEDED TO SEE THEM.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Kohaku Uchiha (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) smiled seems he was the youngest here, although he was more dressed in incredibly formal attire.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Uchiha, Kohaku- I feel out of place being so young, So Yuuto and Batsu, both kin... I bet we will pass with flying colors then.&#34;</font> He held himself with a standard about him, confident but not one to hide the fact he was still rather shy. if one couldn&#39;t be true to themselves then how could one call themselves an Uchiha? 

He&#39;d whip out a fan from his sleeve shaped like the symbol of their clan to cool himself, <font color = white>&#34;I just hope everyone shows promise this year, in and out of the clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) squints and tries to examine Might Try. He looks rather...Plain.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) nods firmly a couple of times, as his gaze focuses upon Hinoue before he reaches for Shishorama's hand, attempting a firm squeeze..!

Alas, he did not possess Senju strength. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: There you go, it should be there now.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) was the living embodiment of masculinity, power, and excellent taste in fashion.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You....are kind of weird.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#95ff95>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) took out a marker and quickly added 'Medical Nin" Into the options of specs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Guhhhhh...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) sagged, defeated and deflated. He took a breath through his wide, flared nostrils, then turned and looked over his shoulder as intensely and confidently as possible, flashing a cheeky grin and batting his thickly lashed eyes while smirking devilishly. A thumbs up rocketed towards Raihara.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: Thanks for your support!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8ed6b2>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The kit with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) pauses for a moment, does she not notice him...? This lady&#39;s a Shinobi, no? If so, then she should be able to realize her precious weapon is about to be swiped away from her at any given moment! Shun&#39;Ichi hesitates, turning over toward his sister once again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, that girl&#39;s a Shininijobi or whatever, right?&#34;</font> He aims to clarify, since Sakuya&#39;s been outside longer than he has, perhaps she was present whenever Komo demonstrated some sense of skill.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: Never needed one? You're tha strong?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn&#39;t seem to care about the formal attire of his cousin, not even their young age. It should be pretty standard for Uchiha&#39;s to have some geniuses every now and then, and he was curious as to what Kohaku was capable of.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh trust me, I spotted quite a few promising... if not interesting, people already.&#34;</font> If both Kohaku and Batsu followed his gaze, they would see him glancing at Might, Try and then at both Hajime and Shishorama talking near the police officer.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) eyes did not change from his normal blank, bored expression. Was this some kind of prank? His cold black eyes merely looked at Try, unblinking.

<font color = white>&#34;Support? Uh...Are you feeling okay?&#34;</font>, he asked.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) yells: OH YEAH!
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) asks: ou're not that strong are you?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) asks: Never better Raihara. Why?
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) says: Yes, legends of the village would say I have a hard ass head.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Cuz today starts our shinobi adventure! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) delicately shakes his hand with the appropriate amount of strength. She took great care not to actually harm her future comrades and classmates. It was her duty to protect those weaker than her, and she&#39;d uphold that belief until the bitter end.

<font color = white>&#34;When I win, I&#39;ll treat you to some food after.~&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: No reason...Nevermind it.
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) says: It looks like it.
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: We should meet some of the other students.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc0000>Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) Kohaku didn&#39;t look much younger than Batsu, wondering just what he meant by feeling out of place. It felt natural for the Uchiha himself to finally become apart of the academy after the years of waiting. He&#39;d nod toward his clan member though, a head nod that usually gestures a greeting.

The statement about passing though the academy would resonate with him though, he&#39;d already expected the academy to be something he could easily maintain as his parents had made him study for as long as he could remember.

<font color = white>&#34;Pleasure to meet you Kohaku and yes... We will indeed exceed in this years academy.&#34;</font> he said, smirking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hatake, Raihara (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: But there are so many.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd individual-Seventh) asks: Do you want to have a hard ass head too? Or you just wanting to give it?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) clicked her tongue, and idly produced a book from within her garment. Adding a pen to the mix, she began to scribble down on a seemingly blank page. Mysteries upon mysteries were written, surely.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Well, I can introduce you to a few.

He simply figured that despite being part of the Senju, she was a girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;No way. I don&#39;t accept hand outs.&#34;</font> 

Despite Hinoue&#39;s clear reluctance, he steps forth and raises a fist towards her, to seek a fist bump. Defiant eyes lock onto her own. </font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;If anyone wants to play an unfair game for my amusement, I&#39;ll be hosting one!&#34;</font> Since it wasn&#39;t an offer that would get many to play on its own, she makes sure to add, <font color = white>&#34;-with a trivial amount of money as a prize, of course.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) Her statement seemed to have fallen on deaf ears as the optimistic one rapidly approached with a fist held out, intent on connecting some type of gesture that was evidently foreign to her with the confusion crawling across her visage. So, what could she do except from taking an offensive stance?!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, you&#39;re trying to fight me right now?&#34;</font>

Legs set further apart, bending ever so slightly at the knees as all digits furl upon both hands - only for the index and middle to extend in an untrained stance. Unique to her lineage.</font></font></font>

Far from impressed with her polished combat stance that had been handed down across generations, he seems shocked, apalled even. He leans back a tad, as if now -he- were the one who could catch something from her.

He turns to face Kyoko on that note, and takes a step away from the Hyuuga, turning his back towards her.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll play.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: I must sit out of this one, I did not gain my fancy clothing by gambling.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, milk-eyes, what&#39;s the game like?&#34;</font> He initiated.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: I doubt it's gambling. She's an officer of the law!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) feels a twinge in her heart, forced to recoil at the girl&#39;s statement. Somehow, she made it sound a lot worse than it actually was..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would nod, this was a fine day- Though they weren&#39;t nobles he&#39;d hope for the two to fair well in the academy, it&#39;s not that he looked down on them. It was simply instilled at a young age he was to protect them, simply because the nobles were born with strong traits and nothing more. Mental conditioning was strong in this one, though he wasn&#39;t ruled by it.

<font color = white>&#34;I do, too... Just don&#39;t push yourselves too much, hard work is fine until you pull a muscle. It happens to everyone eventually.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Kurorama (The gloomy eccentric-MakeshiftWalrus) says: There's always something to lose. Dignity. Pride. Reputation. Though losing these aren't exclusive to gambling I suppose.

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The handsome devil-Dancing Dead) says: Kohaku's right.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#663300>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) looms around the late bloomer with a bright smile. <font color = white>&#34;Your name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Still, he managed to conjure up a sheepish grin in return, refusing to let rudeness take over. <font color = white>&#34;Kaoru.&#34;</font> He replied, giving a brief introduction..</font></font></font>

  She pulled out an attachment, a small spade like object that she wiggled into place on the top of her staff. The tool now resembles a hoe.

<font color = white>&#34;Welcome to Konoha&#39;s academy course. Ya&#39;ll be training to be shinobi that defends the lands of Fire, we shinobi are the heartline of this nation - Just like farmers.&#34;</font>

 Komo tosses her hoe hard towards the dirt behind the students, piercing and parting the dirt with force.

<font color = white>&#34;Instead of feeding mouths, we shinobi solves and prevent those farmer&#39;s problems from interrupting them making harvest.&#34;</font>

A hand extended facing the handed tool, as it suddenly came back to her grasp. <font color = white>&#34;To do that, we practice and master the use of all life force Chakra. Before we git to all that...&#34;</font>

The woman places the hoe back to her rear, facing the memorial.

<font color = white>&#34;This memorial is what we call tribute, tribute to all the shinobi that has succeeded their limits for their nation, some giving up their lives for you to even breathe and be born.

His focus then shifted to the Tribute memorial... and he became a little more serious, even though the situation between Shishorama and the other Hyuuga was anything but that in his eyes.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) || An eyebrow arched slightly as he grappled with a sense of unworthiness, like he hadn't quite earned the privilege to speak up confidently or respond to the Chuunin's question. 

For the present, he opted to be an observer and follow instructions without much fuss. But he knew deep down that this wasn't a stance he intended to maintain forever.

He held fast to the belief that everything will fall into place when the time's right. So long as he does his part and does it well.</font></font></font>

Too easy, Shishorama was probably the most simple person here when it came to being very predictable... The Uchiha would watch as more and more stepped up, a group pooling over time.

Wondering if he should also step up, but he wondered what the Headmaster really meant by elements... What was involved? Most whom stepped up were more durable or stronger from looking by a glance.

<font color = white>&#34;Beat up... a mountain..?&#34;</font> That was an odd phrase, though in a way training was training no matter how odd.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hm...&#34;</font> She mumbled.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I will get my brother.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pinched his chin as he thought it over. They were not just tasked with climbing to the top but also to see to it that all the others present made it, as well.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;We must climb.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Runs up to the mountain and limbers up for a moment getting ready. Wasting no time he jumps up upon the side of the mountain and grabs onto the rocks. A quick glance was given to those who stepped up as well, some girl with white hair and a kid who's name was...Try? That didn't matter, now was not the time to get distracted.

focusing back onto the rock he'd start his climb, his first real moment of the academy. determined not to make a fool of himself the young man doesn't focus on being fast or first, but on consistency. Maybe he wouldn't get to the top first, but he was damn sure going to get there.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) pointed at the mountain.

- <font color = white>&#34;All I have to do is beat it up, right?&#34;</font>

Momoko instead moved back and walked to the nearest lake, kneeling close to it, getting a handfull of water and splashing it across her face. She got up, dusted herself off, took her sandals off, set them aside, and looked right back up at the TALL mountain.

Momoko held her fists back, and started to accumulate momentum. . .

Beginning to utilize the infamous Super Peel Out, Trademarked, catching up with speed and boosting at high-mach towards the Mountain! Her hand shot back,

dramatically reaching out towards the rock, with a blitz effect covering up her POV, flames erupting out of her fingertips, GRIPPING on one rock-hard surface!

Momoko started to punch the mountain&#39;s walls, beginning to climb at a ridiculously fast pace, surpassin-

no, wait, she hasn&#39;t even gotten one meter above the ground. Momoko is scratching the surface at comically high speeds and going nowhere, because physics decided they&#39;d specifically fuck her over.

She looks like a feral cat trying to get over some curtains.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kikku, Rango(The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) OOCs: (...Right, I forgot about that. Swords are less than C iirc, since the ken tree buffs em to C

He moved over to his sister, <font color = white>&#34;Time to make up for having me miss my chance last time.&#34;</font> He hinted, eyeing the woman&#39;s blade once again.

&#39;<i>If I can stomach the shock from touching her blade.... I can probably...&#34; The boy&#39;s mute-red hues kept a close gaze, calculating his chances.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) looked at her brother.

<font color = white>&#34;You will throw me up. Then, I will catch you from the top.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hatake, Towa (The ashen haired girl-ZenchuZaaRachu) would instead watch for a short while. She wore glasses and held books close to her chest. And darted her eyes across the field upon seeing most of her peers climbing the rock.

She decided to give it an attempt, definately soon.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Okay, listen up Sakuya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) didn't want to use his strength to get a stick but climbing was another thing entirely. He thought that he might as well go ahead and see what he can do when it comes to climbing. He was pretty strong and agile, but beyond that, he lacked in almost every other aspect.

Patting his hands together, he was a bit confused of how to go about it at first, and figured he would just jump for the first big rock he could see. Easily managing to make use of his upper body strength to pull himself up... only to dangle for a few moments trying to find a proper foothold for his feet... well that was a bit embarassing.

Still, he found a spot after a few tries and afterwards, it was bit like smooth sailing till halfway up.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Alright! 
<br><font color=teal>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) whispers: ...You look like you might need assistance, if you wish.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Interesting tactics.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) asks: Who wants a boost up?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Mm. Probably.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (i now remember we can't walk over walls unless we got suimen

<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We'll get everyone to the top, alright! 
<br><font color=teal>*Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) draws a long, slow blink before peering up the mountain side. Its large and dangerous crevice would surely be the death of them if one person slipped or failed to grab the right place.

<font color = white>&#34;You should throw me instead and I will catch you.&#34;</font> He doesn&#39;t want to slip and fall to his doom. She was prone to sweat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: Good thinking Try.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: Listeeeen.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Thanks!
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Climbing mountain is a difficult task for most, but Konohagakure Shinobi aren't the average beings. Conquer this and you'll be one step away from earning your bands.
<br><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: I want the girl's blade, you try an' distract her while I "climb" the mountain. But, I'm gonna climb the tree instead.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) narrowed her gaze momentarily, before assuming a careful stance. Her arms are read to grab at his own, and her legs are bent to roll her frame downward to catapult him upward.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay.&#34;</font> The girl replied, bidding him to get a running start.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) gave up trying to climb using her hands.

Momoko walked away and instead approached the closest tree - aggressively kicking the base of it.

A conveniently large-sized tree branch fell off, stabbing the floor beneath her. She is NOT using her brains nor is she trying to use teamwork at all, she's just bashing her face first into it and hoping it works.

And by that, she's now going to use the stick as a trampoline, aligning it just right. She read it in comics, certainly, it can work.

Momoko jumped towards the wall, kicked off it, and dived straight into the stick.  . .

<i>tic</i>.

Only for it to snap like a twig, anticlimatically resulting in nothing happening.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) locked his fingers together with his palms facing upwards and turned his back to the cliff. He didn't need to be the first one up to the next stage of the mountain; this wasn't a race. This was a group effort, and every group needed an anchor! He scanned those gathered for who might take the launch.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) shrugged, that was as good a plan as any he supposed, so he hopped onto the cheerful lad&#39;s back. All they had to do was... get over the mountain by any means.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Kohaku of the Uchiha by the way, I hope you&#39;re good at climbing... I am not.&#34;</font> The boy affirmed, knowing his strength lies with using his chakra.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Climbing rocks isn't so hard if you plan it out before you start.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Push with your legs, don't use your arms to try to pull yourself up.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: And use your core to keep your body close to the cliff!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) began pushing his sister over between the mountain and Komo.

<font color = white>&#34;C&#39;mooon, you owe me anyway, just help me out witth this okay?&#34;</font> He begs, taking another glance at the Chuunin in hopes she doesn&#39;t walk off.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) || Climb up that mountain? It looks more like a plateau. How in the world is he going to do this? And more importantly- How is he going to get the others up there as well? 

He watched as everyone grappled with their own approaches, attempting various methods to conquer the vertical terrain. And then, as if a puzzle piece snapping into place, an idea took shape in his mind. He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, the cogs of his mind whirring.

<font color = white>&#34;Hmmm. . .&#34;</font> He mused aloud. A lightbulb flickered above his head as an idea finally kicked in, he projected his voice even louder.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, folks!&#34;</font> His tone raised, hoping that everyone would heed his words.

<font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s take turns giving each other a boost, and then use the human chain we create to pull up the stragglers. We&#39;ll make it together that way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: But I don't have any chains.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is glad this was so readily accepted. The pale student moves himself back, as close to the water as he can manage without risk of slipping and falling in before suddenly charging forward.

With the running start he will draw closer to his sister before anticipating where she holds the flats of her palm, awaiting the leverage to send him skyward with a press of the foot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With utmost confidence, Shishorama stands tall and unwavering before the formidable mountain. She flexes her fingers, producing a satisfying crackling sound, and rotates her neck to loosen any tension before taking a determined step forward. Despite being presented with a daunting task, she took it upon herself to undergo it. 

Shisho charges towards the towering rock formation. As she approaches, she reaches out to touch its rugged surface, feeling the rough texture under her fingertips. Though the task seems daunting, with nothing but her own strength and unwavering resolve, she sets out to climb it, determined to conquer the daunting challenge.

With a steady pace and an unwavering smile, she ascends the mountain, pushing herself to her natural limits. The sweat on her face and the strain in her muscles are clear signs of the effort she is putting into the climb. Nevertheless, she refuses to be defeated by the physical toll and makes her way to the top.

<font color = white>&#34;ARGGHHHHH!&#34;</font> The intense young woman <b>ROARS</b> at the top of her lungs once the pinnacle had been reached, claiming her victory among the students that remained at the bottom of the rocky formation. 

<font color = white>&#34;HERE STANDS, SENJU SHISHORAMA! SUCCESSOR OF THE WILL OF FFIIIIIIRRREEEEE!!!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) , with his hands still linked together to provide a boost and his back to the cliff face turned and looked to the late bloomer. <font color = white>&#34;Great idea! I&#39;ll boost you up first, then you can help pull them up.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) asks: What do you need me to do?
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: Alright, that's one- There's two.
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) asks: Anyone else want in?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I can push or I can go up and pull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) struck with perfect timing, suggesting that these acrobatic feats were practiced often-- or else, the pair shared some instinctual link, giving them the sort of frame-perfect coordination required to achieve this. Either way, in one graceful, fluid motion the girl rolled and the boy was boosted, propelled by both palms and feet high into the air; he'd be able to make it up for sure.

The dancer, for her part, is quick to get off the ground and brush the dirt from her clothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: In>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) stared at the bloodly samurai that just snapped a branch from the tree. She points to the ground before speaking.

<font color = white>&#34;If ya&#39;ll get hurt or something, just use nature&#39;s bandaid. Rub some dirt on it.&#34;</font>

She said, as she examined the other groups. Some were trying to work together, not a bad plan. Probably the most easiest way to complete a task, however it depends on the core strengths of the members for it to be a success.
  Komo would step her way around the groups of academy students, plugging her ears when she made her way by the Intense Senju, watching him head to the top of the mountain.

  Clan strength was truly something else...

She watched as others adopted the samurai&#39;s tactics, using their surroundings to climb such a object.

<font color = white>&#34;Resourceful.&#34;</font>

</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: Either role works, just that I'll be counting on the physically strongest to reel in the rest.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) Although the Uchiha hand't found a good spot to continue to climbing, he managed to see one just out of reach. He had an idea of what to do and wanting to show himself capable, he tried to get to it straight away...but... there was some hesitation as he would need to jump and be airborne for a moment, if he missed, he was screwed.

The fall wasn't THAT great though, so with his heart speeding up, he took a deep breath and made a leap, hands shooting forward eagerly, almost desperately for the crevice that would allow him to continue on.

Afterwards, he had to take a few deep breaths to calm down and continued on! Now he wasn't as a fraid as before, and just as he was about to reach the top, he heard Shishorama's screams of excitement.

He was just a bit too late for it. Well, next time!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) looked up towards the cliffside with a gulp.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow.&#34;</font> he says softly, tugging at his collar. They&#39;d look around to the others, looking for reactions perhaps. He had hoped to see others as worried as he was, hoping to not seem TOO out of place with his fear of heights.

<font color = white>&#34;O-okay!&#34;</font> he said, marching towards the mountain now. He studied the rock&#39;s face with intensity, planning his way before actually even trying. They saw nooks and crannies that would potentially fit his hands and feet. After awhile of putting together a strategy, he&#39;d move!

One hand stretched up first, his foot following after as it placed itself in a crack along the rocks. Not even ten feet up he&#39;d look down, eyes becoming wide as he saw the ground below.

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh...&#34;</font> he sighed, looking back up now. contiuing the climb with a slow pace. He wouldn&#39;t rush it, just knowing he only had to reach the top and wasn&#39;t asked to do so with haste. Finally, he would grasp a hand on the top of the cliff, pulling himself up to the top shakily. 

<font color = white>&#34;I-I did it!&#34;</font> he&#39;d roar, looking down the cliffside before fainting, falling on his backside from the fear it had induced!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I can pull then.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll go up first.
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I can pull.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Climbing climbing climbing this was turning out to be easier than expected, but then again what kid didn&#39;t like to climb on things? Despite this being labeled as official training it was nothing new to the young kid. He had spent many days in the past running around the village and climbing to places he probably shouldn&#39;t have.

Reaching out with his hand and pushing up with his legs, a boundless stamina allowed the kid to continue up the mountain with little trouble, it was only about passing the halfway point did he hear Shishorama yell out....damn she had beaten him. Oh well, it didn&#39;t matter. 

Reaching the top of the first track he looks back and only now realizes how high up they really were....perhaps this was a bit different from the school yard. Regardless he yells down 

<font color = white>&#34;Right I&#39;ll help anyone else up &#34;</font> he offers to the ones below.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) says: I like pulling things.
<br><font color=green>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) says: . . .She clocked out again.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: More and more of you are getting to the top... Maybe this mountain isn't tall enough.
<br><font color=red>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) increases their stamina and chakra to full.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Yea my bad. I was focusing on giant robot fights.
<br><font color=green>*Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: Now... how do I jump that high...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) is launched and that, folks, was all that she wrote. His slight frame coupled with quantum mechanics and some other shit leads to him getting to a pretty solid place on the mountain. Yet, with a particularly large rock he will have to cling to in order to hold on.

His arm is over the base of it and all of his strength is used to keep himself there. Thus, he turns, <font color = white>&#34;Jump now.&#34;</font> Otherwise it will be for nothing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#884250>Kikku, Rango (The cheerful lad-AGhostlyKnight) gives a beaming smile and turns towards the mountain, not entirely paying attention to formalities <font color = white>&#34;That crevasse will make a decent spot!&#34;</font> he states excitedly, not wanting to expend too much energy for when he comes to collect others.
 He beings to climb using the crack, leisurely climbing as he hums a tune..  Untill he starts to stagger a bit quickly checking up on the Uchiha on his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Make sure to hold on as tight as ya can!&#34;</font> He shouts and before long.. with a few near stumbles, but a generally calm climb, the two make it up beside the others at the top.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: I was asleep.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Oh, good idea!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: It's my duty to help them up!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) starts to climb down... well, that oughta be easier than climbing up, surely... right?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) says: Hurry.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Half the task is getting up there, the second one is getting the rest of the class there too.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) says: You heard Sensei, if one fails we all fail.
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) yells: ...!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clapped her hands, the noise a resounding acknowledgement of his words. She's got a target to leap to and intends to make it there. A quick look around found her a branch, and the little eleven year old wielded it with impossible strength as she took a step back and then ran forward. Her pole finds the sandy ground of the river bank and lets her careen forward. Deftly, she jumped from it, and one small arm found itself reaching.

She grabbed at his wrist, thudding into the mountain harshly. 

That should have hurt, but she didn't make a sound. Moments later, she's found herself some footholds, and they've got a signfiicant headstart on the mountain.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) put his plan into motion. Leaning his back against the wall and adopting a squatting stance, he formed his hands into a makeshift platform, ready to serve as a human springboard. This would give the more physically capable members, the Samurai and the Youth a chance to utilize their strength not just to gain height, but also to secure a grip on a ledge, providing a sturdy foundation for their climb.

If the pieces fell into place as hoped, the Samurai and the Youth would lift him up next, a sequence that would repeat as they ascended. His own role came next  using his position as a link, connecting the chain formed by the others. Depending on their willingness and ability, either the Youth or the Samurai could be the anchor and hook.

He acknowledged that not everyone would be on the same wavelength as him, so he proceeded with those who were on the same page. His personal charisma might influence some, but he understood its limits.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Yuuto(The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) OOCs: (does anyone know if there's a doc with the combat rules
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: so we got to get up there...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Just hold up a moment, we'll be right down there to help ya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;--&#34;</font>

Shun&#39;Ichi shot his sister a scathing glare, mouthing inaudibly an <i>I&#39;ll do it myself</i> in her general direction before taking a glance to the mountain.

Three problems would arise, well--two and a half problems. First, there&#39;s no chance he&#39;s proficient enough to climb the mountain with these heavy clothes, and he doesn&#39;t have spares to replace them with--so no chance in a quick change.
Second: Komo&#39;s sword being flowed with some sort of chakra, being completely unaware of how chakra functions, the punk&#39;s simply going to have to go through with counteracting that... Somehow. 
He spits in his hands, rubbing the saliva together in order to produce an adequate amount of friction for the rough mountain walls to feel less abrase. In any case, the half problem comes to what Komo&#39;ll do if he&#39;s successful.

Assuming he&#39;ll even get close to grabbing her blade from the top of the mountain.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright, climbing, that&#39;s easy... Yeah...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We're starting a chain.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We'll boost up and pull others up.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: You guys can be the next level up.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Oh! Nice idea.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: Those who lack strength can get the most help.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: The stronger ones can come up after!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) says: Get on the chain you three on the back.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) clumsily rushes down the cliff face. After reaching the half-way point, she slips on a rock and tumbles down a flight. With a loud oof, the girl splatters against the stone ground. Bleeding from her skull as she was, she eagerly hopped to her fellow students and extended a steady hand to whoever might be needing assistance!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll help you! I&#39;ll help all of you!&#34;</font> She beams proudly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) sat down and thinks. It was ethier let someone carry him up there or just fail.<font color = white>&#34;Uh  guess I sit here and wait..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll hang out in the middle until we get everyone up.

<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: That second ledge will be a little bit harder.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993a33>Senju, Matsurama  (The solemn youngster-Dozinz) Leans down now and lays flat upon the mountain to steady himself as much as possible. Taking off his coat he quickly ties it to a nearby rock to anchor himself. Once all the set he leans over to the two white haired students below him.

<font color = white>&#34;Alright just get to me and I&#39;ll help pull you up&#34;</font> he calls down to them. It was a good idea Try had to help others out, and he could see even now the others were coming down to help as well. The class just might make it to the top.
</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We can go together.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: Fine...
<br><font color=green>*Kaoru (The late bloomer-SonikkuX) says: We should dig up some dirt and push it against the cliffside for slightly higher ground to start with.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Remember! It's not a race but a team effort!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b02f2f>Fikset, Momoko (The bloodhungry samurai-GokentoHardcore) Momoko dusted her hands off, took a few steps back, and hopped once - The momentum of her fall being used to start a jog, and soon a sprint, running straight up into the Bloomer's trampoline -

Getting leverage to LEAP up high into the next 'floor'.

Her hand reached out to the Overconfident Kid, trying to hold and hang to him!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) get's lifted up and followed the busy browed guy.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4a6969>Kaguya, Kamiseito (The pale, red-eyed acrobat-Autumn Hound) doesn't allow her to thud at all, in actuality. When she's snatched onto his extended hand, gripping him by the wrist the boy seems to swing with all of his momentuous strength (which wasn't much) and hurls the pale haired girl higher.

Oh baby, it was ice climbers time.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) pulled his scarf off from around his neck and tied it around his waist. He offered the other end to the chill young boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Are you sure?
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: I'll go up and you can come up behind me.
<br><font color=green>*Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) says: Right..
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) says: We've got someone at the bottom boosting people up and someone at the top to take our hands.
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: We'll get there together! Yos!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) continued her observation of the students making their way to the top, some finally realizing the second part of this lesson. However, this exercise could be a little tough for the first day; but many of them already proved her wronng.
She held her staff close as some even got a few scratches along the way.

Komo's eyes were like an eagle, peering at every situation that could happen. Her thumb rubbing against the hilt of her staff - Red staining her thumb print as well as the hilt's steel end.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Uchiha, Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) was kneeling by the edge together with Shishorama, just waiting for the first person that would be sent that way. The moment the first one came, he immediately reached out to firmly grab the hand of that samurai and pull them up on the second floor. <font color = white>&#34;Alright, now let&#39;s boost you up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99ffcc>Makoto (The chill young boy-Interd123) holded the tie. This was going to be ethier fine or a rough day.<font color = white>&#34;Damm be careful man...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) opened an eyem,

<font color = white>&#34;O-oh okay...&#34;</font> he gulped, looking back down the cliffside before trying to climb back down. He aimmed to join the student made totem pole, trying to allow the others an express route up the cliffside along the others.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t let me fall!&#34;</font> he says, gripping onto the stone&#39;s face.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) could hardly deal with Laro&#39;s raw offensive speed. As hardy and braggadocious as she was, she had little practice in the real art of battle, and lacked the capability to back up her talk with skill alone. Indeed, she was outclassed in every regard!

Still, she just barely manages a block and swings at Laro&#39;s chin!

<font color = white>&#34;Ah, this is close! I don&#39;t think I can beat you yet!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (1/1)

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Shishorama wanted a jumpstart on the academy, so she's having people train with her.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) would once again attempt to evade the attack, this time ducking under attack. He'd quickly answer right back with a hit of his own, trying to once again hit at her body.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) is hit squarely in the gut. The girl&#39;s eyes bug out as the pain spreads through her abdomen. Strangely enough, her smile only grows. As his fist smashes into her body, could feel her sturdy frame harden as if preparing for the blow. She was well on her way to developing a tough physique, unfortunately she just wasn&#39;t there yet.

<font color = white>&#34;That was a good one!&#34;</font> She exclaims wildly as she throws yet another sloppy punch to the other&#39;s face!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (Light taken)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (after being hit, your defensive turns reset)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) shuffled into the arena area, looking around as it seemed two were engaged in a sparring match.

<font color = white>&#34;A-am I late for something?&#34;</font> he&#39;d ask, tugging at his scarf nervously.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff7c80>Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) looked back at the wandering child- a wave tossed his way.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey! Nope, not at all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Kyouko (The police chief-DatBooma) says: Some of the students wanted to get some practice before classes start.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) could feel that she was suprisingly sturdy compared to his hits, perhaps something he neeed to work on in due time. Yet he landed a hit, none-the-less. But it didn't seem like it slower her down much as she launched another attack right back at him.

Once again he managed to block it, but surely his ability to block shots was running out.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The wandering child-TwistedKilla187) smiled as he was informed he wasn&#39;t late.

<font color = white>&#34;Whew... Thank goodness.&#34;</font> he says, returning a wave towards the police chef now. They&#39;d then look on to the sparring match, observing the two going at it as he relaxed with the others.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, t-that sounds good.&#34;</font> he said, hoping to see what he might pick up from their match.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) he also punched her back.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: My n-name's Yakeru by the way. Sarutobi, Yakeru.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) With a swift movement, Shishorama brings her forearm up to deflect Laro's incoming strike. In a split second, she turns the tables and attempts to deliver a powerful blow to his sternum, showcasing her tenacity and grit despite her lack of refined martial prowess. Her unyielding spirit and unwavering determination serve as her greatest weapon, allowing her to hold her own against even the most skilled opponents.

His folded arm stance remains. The teen shifts to stand the amber-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Did yuh say Sarutobi?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) nodded,

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s luck did run out, as she finally managed to land an attack. And it was quite a strong one, as she managed to hit him right into his sternum with a rather powerful punch. It knocked the air out of him, causing him to hunch over a bit, sustaining rather heavy injury.

As he held his stomach, it was quite evident, one of those would probably put him out of the commission.

He could probably land a few more hits on her but would it be enough? Probably not.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Another spar?!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Dodge it!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Dodge the flick!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Can I at least get your name, white haired brat?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Call me that again and you'll get a lot more than a name.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: What else can you give besides a n- Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: They'll give you a nickname!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: What's more than a name huh.

<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A nickname!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Oh. What? She would give me a nickname?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Ok brat.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) stepped up and swung at Sakuya!

[D striking]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) instictively rushed to Sakuya's defense and took the brunt of the blow!</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) As the white-haired dancer swings at her, Sakuya quickly parries the punch with her arm. Seizing the moment, she throws a punch right back, aiming for the dancer&#39;s midsection...Is what she would have done but her cousin saved her oddly.

<font color = white>&#34;Rather rude of you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks between the two Senjus and white haired dancer. Was this an altercation brewing in real time. Perhaps something needed to be done to calm the tensions.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey guys, umm, how about we all just take a moment to cool off? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) crushed through the youngster&#39;s defenses, but found herself parried off-- Or something.

Someone got hit for the shit talking, so she let it be for now with scowling, red eyes.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re the one calling people names.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighed and shook her head, <font color = white>&#34;I thought you guys were just being friendly. What do we actually call you then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: Is this not for the enrollments?
<br><font color=red>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) increases their health by Heavy Damage - 5.96 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Kamiya.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#468ca3>Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) nervously watched the few bicker amongst themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...&#34;</font> is all he could manage to get out, deciding to not get in the middle of things.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: A pleasure to meet you Kamiya!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Swallowing her pride, she steps forward with her hand extended in a gesture of apology.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m sorry,&#34;</font> she says sincerely, looking into the dancer&#39;s eyes. <font color = white>&#34;I didn&#39;t mean to offend you. If I&#39;ve said or done something to upset you, I apologize.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am not sure what I said as well.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#c0c0c0>Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) shifted his gsaze as he never exactly got his question answered.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) heaves a sigh.

<font color = white>&#34;Pfew. Glad that&#39;s sorted out. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) yawned, what a morning it had been already, just idly passing the time. She would just glance over to the girl next to her briefly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. We haven&#39;t spoken before but since we&#39;re standing here. I&#39;m Okiku.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) glad the fighting stopped. She would've just kept taking punches for either student until she passed out. Crisis averted.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sorry my cousin is aloof as well.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) squinted between them, obviously suspicious of the apology and pleasant greetings. Darting eyes warily regarded the hand gesture. This was the second weirdo to say something and then pretend they didn&#39;t know it&#39;d be a problem. Shoulders roll, dislocating and then -popping- back into place as she maintained her expression, despite the pain that should have caused.

<font color = white>&#34;... fine.&#34;</font> She mumbled, carefully taking her hand.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (was glad*
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;That was rather... Keep doing that and you&#39;re going to have arthritis soon,&#34;</font> she says, pointing meaningfully at the girl&#39;s shoulders.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Teach me how to roll my shoulder like that!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) looks over at the shoulder dislocating like that.

<font color = white>&#34;That looked painful. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: You should get that checked out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) released the other girl&#39;s hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t know how to teach. Just do it.&#34;</font> She replied, ignoring the cautions against arthritis. <font color = white>&#34;Of course it was painful.&#34;</font> She replied, wondering how it could not be-- or why anyone would do it if it wasn&#39;t. Dislocation could be useful for escaping binds, though...

<font color = white>&#34;I don&#39;t think I can ger arthiritis.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: get*
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: Can you dislocate anything else?
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I see this is today's new hangout.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: This will be my everyday hang out!
<br><font color=red>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) increases their health by Full - 6 / 6.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) yells: Mind if I see!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: At least you'll be easy to find, Shishorama.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) held a hand out and bent her index finger nearly all the way back, until it was curling backwards. This was less of a dislocation and more of a hypermobility, though-- but which kid would even care? There's a slight shift in expression, suggesting this was somehow more painful than the shoulder roll.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) widened her eyes at Kamiya&#39;s finger. What the heck is even that?! <font color = white>&#34;Oh my goodness! Your finger is <b>BROKEN</b>!!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: Nope, the bones are just fine.
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: ...?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya watches with a mixture of fascination and curiosity as the white-haired dancer flexes her index finger backward in an extreme display of hypermobility. For a moment, Sakuya thinks she can detect a wince in the dancer&#39;s eyes, a subtle hint that this unusual flexibility comes at a cost.

Intrigued, a thought crosses Sakuya&#39;s mind: this girl might be just as eccentric as she is. Feeling a newfound sense of kinship, she can&#39;t help but feel that a friendship between them could be equally intriguing and enriching.

Taking a step closer, Sakuya smiles and extends her hand in a friendly gesture. <font color = white>&#34;You know, we might have more in common than we thought. Would you like to be friends? I&#39;m Sakuya, by the way. Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would dead pan and turn towards Shishorama.

<font color = white>&#34;He&#39;s a Kaguya- Like the Hokage.&#34;</font> Hoping this would shed some light on their abilities in some compacity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) &#39;s jaw dropped as he saw Kamiya&#39;s finger.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s...scary to see. Also anyone else started to feel pain in their fingers after seeing that? No, just me? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*she's)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I think he is a she.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [oh man ur lucky u fixed that]
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks: So it was an over reaction?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Who cares that she's a Kaguya?! She just broke- twisted her finger!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) asks: Do we have a medic-nin nearby?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) let her finger snap back. <font color = white>&#34;Sure, Sakuy--&#34;</font> Kamiya stopped mid sentence, certain she had heard another unlucky soul who wanted to receive a punch. The feeling vanished after a moment. Her finger is held with her other hand, and its discolored, now-- significantly redder than the others, a little swollen. It was hardly a free action as evidenced by this cost.

<font color = white>&#34;It hurts, but it isn&#39;t broken.&#34;</font> She said, to the intense youngster. <font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t break my bones.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) gave a long stare- A long confused, judgemental stare before mentally facepalming.

<font color = white>&#34;Her abilities are probably like Lord Hokage, a Kaguya... They manipulate bone.&#34;</font> A smirk came to his face, he found it funny people hadn&#39;t heard stories of the Leader of the Village. Though on a second glance... They could manipulate Bones... but the fleshy parts were still damaged.

<font color = white>&#34;Though, youf pain tolerance must be insane since you damage the flashy bits...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (*your Typo 2/2 may as well aim for the moon in typos.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Can Kamiya manipulate my bones too?
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) asks:  You realized if they're okay then you shouldn't over react, right?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I would assume so.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (question, Kamiya
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (does Kamiya resemble a male?)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) grinned at the Uchiha on the end of the line. She approached the boy, and held  her swollen index finger out. There&#39;s a look of incredible focus. She grunted, and huffed, and puffed, the obvious spice of pain in her inflection as a -hole- began to open at the end of her finger, and a pure, white finger bone began to poke out. It&#39;s clear this is taking an exhaustive amount of effort as her entire body is shaking.

It was revolting; unsettling.

<font color = white>&#34;Pull my finger.&#34;</font> Urged a strained voice.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [yes]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya(The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) OOCs: [the other 11 year old kaguya]
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Kohaku(The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) OOCs: (Kami M and Kami F.)
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I have a question before I pull your finger!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Are you a male or female? I'm not sure what to call you!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) couldn&#39;t tell if she was talking to him or to the sable-haired youth next to him. Either way the request was rather weird. Kamiya wanted her finger to be pulled, while it seemed the bone was starting to protrude through the actual finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh-huh. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would blink for a moment, though in his morbid curiousity he&#39;d absolutely do so. He wondered if that bone was in-fact coming out of that gory hole Kamiya&#39;s body seem to make. The Uchiha heard stories of the bones tearing through skin of both user and foe, this was far more clean than anticipated. However there was a strangeness to it when seeing something like this first hand.

The weird part was seeing how white the bone was despite it travelling through fleshm he expected them stained red, really.

<font color = white>&#34;Gnarly.&#34;</font> It was the only wword he could think of while doing this.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) clenched her jaw as he pulled an entire digit out. The hole closed, and rather than some gelatenous, boneless finger like one woudl expect, Kamiya seemed no worse for wear than before. There wasn&#39;t even a sign that she&#39;d just opened and inch wide hole in her flesh. The pain was real, but there were not lasting effects. 

She took the finger from him and wagged it in his face, the digit bouncing and bending at each knuckle. 

<font color = white>&#34;And now I can use this like a dagger!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) carefully observed the whole thing. The word &#39;gnarly&#39; described it well. But the boy got so invested into the process that he could see every little detail. And this, well, this had undesired results.

Dark haired boy immediately covered his mouth.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh I think I&#39;m gonna be sick. &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: ---
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: She just -- pulled the -- bone out.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the finger, dumbfounded. She thought she&#39;d seen a lot in her twelve years of life, but that was absolutely <i>disgusting</i>. Never wanting to witness that again, she persists in asking Kamiya the question that bothered her so greatly.

<font color = white>&#34;So....are you a male or female...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly wheeled around, slashing the intense youngster with her abnormally sharp finger bone.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you stupid?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Well, no...maybe..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) wasn&#39;t sure if he should find this cool, scary, concerning, or morbid. He proceeded to mentally choose all of the above.

<font color = white>&#34;Eeeehww, but awesome. That&#39;s taking &#39;pointer finger&#39; very literally.&#34;</font> Making fun of the situation rather than keeling over sick, though he really had no idea how to react and fell back on humour as a coping mechanism.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) stared at the they/them, unphased. <font color = white>&#34;I just can&#39;t tell, okay?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: It's really obvious I'm a girl, you weirdo.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: O-Oh!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Right!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Because the voice!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: ...And the hair...?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: R-Right!
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: And the pretty face? 
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: The other Kami is a guy.
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) asks: And the unearthjly grace?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Well, you certainly have unearthly grace!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Yeah that last one...oh never mind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) loomed.

<font color = white>&#34;Right?&#34;</font> She whispered, dangerously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) asks: Don't all Kaguya have the poise?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) leaned closer to Kamiya with a quirked eyebrow, <font color = white>&#34;Why are we whispering?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Ei!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) makes a small yelp in surprise. She wasn&#39;t easily intimidated, but Kamiya was getting there. <font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you poking me with that!? It came from inside you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) covers his mouth again as she poked her with the finger bone.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Pointer Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Sticky Finger.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: It's not my fault that I couldn't tell what you were! You didn't ask to be born like that!
<br><font color=green>*Anri (The dead eyed teen-Airide) says:  ...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I feel a punch coming.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: I have a feeling it'd be more like a puncture wound.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) suddenly whipped the finger toward the wall, letting it smash against it into bits and pieces.

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re pretty stupid. You&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t beat up special needs children.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: So the bones can break...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: That is a good one.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) frowned a bit at the Kaguya&#39;s remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey hey, no need to call names. We&#39;re all friends here. Right? &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) sighs and relaxes as the tension in her body dies down. She was expecting a punch or stab, but it never came. <font color = white>&#34;Phew...that was close. - I wonder when the classes are going to start.&#34;</font> She says, looking off into the distance. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Laro(The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) OOCs: ( hmm so are apps closed? )

A smile given towards the old Shinobi before dropping her voice lower in a whisper, but still audible to all those around if they listened.

<font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s more where that&#39;s from if I pass with straight A grades.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) crossed her arms as she turns to walk past Hajime, briefly sticking her tongue out before halting closer to the others, <font color = white>&#34;I think I&#39;ll have a better time watching you open your grades and hide from me afterwards. Because you did worse.&#34;</font> She had to clarify that last part... Obviously.

<font color = white>&#34;My clan only excels and succeeds after all.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) leaned back up, staring at the sky before sighing.

<font color = white>&#34;I will get my family back for this...&#34;</font> He mumbled, raising a single fist in the air.,</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Seems they are doing the bonding.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) raised a single eyebrow, slipping into her pouch as she removes a wad of of over three-hundred ryo. In a hushed voice she spoke.

<font color = white>&#34;So, what&#39;s the price then?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looked over at the blissful youth.

<font color = white>&#34;Are you Kumirama?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I'm rich.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I have no price.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Kumirama is not over here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) squints, and soon clenches a fist..! Her gesture draws a slightly reddened face from the young man, in frustration.

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;ll see about that.&#34;</font>

He turns away from her, and soon forces a smile as he takes steps towards the two girls in the distance.

<font color = white>&#34;Hello. I&#39;m Hajime. Nice to meet you both.&#34;</font>

A single fist extends forth, towards them. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Prove you're rich.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) looks at her fancy clothes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) with a sigh she&#39;d instead remove the largest fish she had recently caught, handing it over towards the instructor before stepping back next to Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll do great at school, teacher.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Hm... Acceptable.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: She does look rich.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Hey, hey. Komo-sensei. How'd you get rich?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) glanced left. 
She glanced right.

It looks like the coast was clear. As long as she ignored the twenty eyeballs within the vicinity. Conditions were perfect. She tip-toed her way over to the guard rail. 

<i>Aaaand</i> slowly started to climb over the obstacle. Her eyes were glued to that discarded single ryo bill. She could buy some candy with that. What a waste! To let it flow away on the current!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Hm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) grabs the raw fish that was given to her by the kombu green haired girl. She savagly bite into the raw fish in its mid section, devouring everything until stuffing the rest of the fish into her mouth, tail end last.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) wasn't sure if she should be frightened or impressed by the display.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) bumped a swollen fist against his.

<font color = white>&#34;Kamiya.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Working hard is a good start. Finding more doors to make money.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Being born rich helps too.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) <font color = white>&#34;I am Sakuya Senju.&#34;</font> She turns to the bright boy and extends her hand. <font color = white>&#34;Nice to meet you as well, Hajime.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Why's your fist swollen?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) watched Hanako go after the ryo, he didn't care- No one else seemed to care, therefore it was fair game for the Platinum Blonde to go fishing for it. Though he stopped staring to wwatch the Headmistress become a savage and potentially poison herself  to mortify Children.

It seemed to be working.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) does not notice the antics of the headmistress, nor the missed opportunity of nabbing 1 ryo.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9933ff>Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) blinked a few times, watching how the women just devoured a raw fish, He thought for a second, Just staring at her before nodding.

<font color = white>&#34;Do all girls eat like?&#34;</font> He questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Not girls, but real women.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I see...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Impressive.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) flops over the guard rail, entirely lacking in grace, and sploshed into the river. 

A minute later, she emerged, blowing on the recovered bill, trying and failing to air-dry it. A soggy set of sandal-prints were left in her trail as she made her way back to Position A! Lurking beneath the street light. 

Drenched, but the grin she wore says she's elated by her mission accomplished. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) says: I pulled my finger out.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Entirely.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's bad.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You shouldn't do that.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: I think you could win a eating competition.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Then she poked Shishorama with the bone.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ..
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't think it is as bad as it seems.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hard core.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Good work, Hanako. Stealth is a virtue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: w-- You saw?!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) steps away on that note, shuddering, even.

Was he speaking to some sort of savage?

<font color = white>&#34;G-good luck in the academy..!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I mean, uh..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. saw what? I did nothing.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I don't like his face.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: ?!?!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: I see everything, I've been practicing.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I would pass on eating contests.. They are a waste of food.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's kinda rude.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) pulled out a fish of her own as she stared towards it. She&#39;d take a few seconds of simply gazing at the fish before starting to copy the teacher as she devoured it all bar the bone which would be deposited into a nearby trashcan.

However astute eyes would notice that whilst the fish she had taken out was raw, every bite would be charred and mostly cooked as they entired her mouth. The Hyuugas would clearly notice her pumping katon attuned chakra into the fish to flashcook it.

<font color = white>&#34;Now I&#39;m a real woman, like sensei.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: I heard that, y'know?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh yeah? Well--
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: I was talking to my friend.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Loudly.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: That is the true test of womanhood...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: Hmm...a waste. I guess that makes sense.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: That's okay, I don't like you either. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) yawns while trotting down the road.
He glances over to Kamiya, standing next to his sister.

<font color = white>&#34;You.&#34;</font> He scowls ot the both of them, though mostly to Kamiya for now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: You looked at her weirdly. I didn't appriecate that.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) says: Usually people descale and debone the Sashimi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) giggled at Sakuya&#39;s words. She approached Hajime and drew her nails down her cheeks, drawing blood--

And then, Shun&#39;ichi appeared.

<font color = white>&#34;What?&#34;</font> She spat.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: A true women it's it whole I've been told.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...............
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: I must continue my search for Kumirama.
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: She went north I believe but I might be blind.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) paused. 

Her limited attention span was drawn to the events taking place nearby. Aversion, repulsion, and every sickened emotion in between creased and wrinkled her face, watching someone eat a fish of all things in such a animalistic manner!

<font color = white>&#34;Gross. Fish are gross! Don&#39;t you know where that thing&#39;s been, Maya?!&#34;</font>
She waved her arms frantically in protest!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares.

His eyes widen upon seeing the illogical behavior of Kamiya, who draws blood with her own nails. 

<font color = white>&#34;Umm... Kamiya, does that not hurt...?&#34;</font> He asks, though the sheer display has him weirded out, incredibly so.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held out a single seal, disappearing.

<font color = white>&#34;I was hunt her like a hunter during mating season.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: will*
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Kaito (The dark haired boy-Godlike2909) says: What a interesting person.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;.....&#34;</font> Nothing was said, he simply glares, circling her aimlessly before replacing her spot at Sakuya&#39;s side.

<font color = white>&#34;Why&#39;re you hanging around that thing, sis?&#34;</font> He initiates.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) looks to Maya as a fish was withdrawn from somewhere and stared at, <font color = white>&#34;Wait, that&#39;s not good for you--&#34;</font> The Hyuuga grimaced as the Gorumba&#39;s mouth opened to chow down - only to relax all of a sudden and exhale. All tension flows away, like that ryo bill in the river would have if not &#39;saved&#39; by Hanako.

She was puffing flames to cook it at the very last second... Scary, but... Not as poisonous as it could have been. The fish probably had scales and everything though, gross.

<font color = white>&#34;...I think fish isn&#39;t for me anymore.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) removed a napkin from her pouch as she began to delicately dab at her lips in order to clean them of any fishy debris before turning her attention towards Hanako.

<font color = white>&#34;This river, I caught it myself...&#34;</font>

A simple answer to a straight forward questio as her head cocked to the side in a curious manner.

<font color = white>&#34;And it&#39;s a fresh as it comes, orphans can&#39;t be picky.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) asks: What thing are you talking about?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) swiped her eyes over at Hajime. The cuts aren&#39;t particularly deep, but she bled softly from the rake all the same. It doesn&#39;t take long for it to roll down to her jawline, and then drip to the cobblestone beneath.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course it hurts.&#34;</font> She replied, before moving to face the ugly, green-haired boy.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m going to hurt you really badly.&#34;</font> She promised to Shun&#39;ichi.</font></font></font>

It was indeed a pin bone that she had swallowed, a sharp end had lodged itself within the base of her esophagus and needed to be dislodged.

However she was too weak to dislodge it herself, causing each weak dull thump to just cause her to choke loudly.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I knew it!

He had seen it happen before..! 

<font color = white>&#34;No pain, no gain..&#34;</font>

After garnering the necessary momentum, the young orphan jumps onto Maya&#39;s stomach to deliver a drop kick with the force of gravity behind it, performing the most violent heimlich maneuver possible..!

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve got you..!&#34;</font>

The fact that the Hyuuga was trying to save her had ignited his competitive spirit, and he wished to do so, instead. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi(The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (My fault, was setting up profile, gimme like one more min)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: W-wait! I'm fine..!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9c9ce3>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) Alas! A saviour who knew what was wrong, her attempted murder by drowning was adverted for now as the strike PERFECTLY dislodged the bone as it ejected from her mouth with speed, flying through the air in a perfect arc before landing innocently on the ground in front of them.

A gasp of air entered her lungs as she began to violently cough for a few seconds.

<font color = white>&#34;T-Thanks... damn fish bone.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: Are you sure? You ate pavement really hard!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Like.. your head made a 'thonk' noise.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I thought that only happened in manga! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) has a lump on his head, from it striking the pavement.

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah, but if you put me in the water, I&#39;ll get wet. My money will get wet. Then, I won&#39;t be able to buy you the stuff I told you I would.&#34;</font> He protests, before he raises both hands up to plead for mercy.

His eyes were spinning, though. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) released him, if only because he insisted he was fine. 

<font color = white>&#34;Untrue! Shopkeeps don&#39;t mind when the ryo&#39;s a little soggy! They just.. narrow their eyes and stare at you a lot. It&#39;s probably because the sogginess makes the numbers harder to read?&#34;</font> She shrugs! A hand came down, offering to yank him to his feet. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) would watch the Senju and Kaguya both strike the bastard child of a Senju, he was doomed. Though, the one being struck was being a jerk. He honestly didn&#39;t care if it didn&#39;t escalate further than it had, and all the while another girl was saved from a fish bone.

<font color = white>&#34;And the day was saved, thanks to the Hyuuga.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) An overbearingly smug grin hooked upon the corners of the Hyuuga&#39;s lips and tugged wider as she witnessed her perfect strike dislodge the fish bone straight from the source. It surprised her a little, but she would never admit that. As far as anyone else knew, this was planned and she was the most skilled academy student.

<font color = white>&#34;Ahaha! You&#39;re welcome. Nothing comes close to my clan&#39;s techniques after all,&#34;</font> she proclaimed, side-eyeing Hajime after he had failed to compete and was now being dragged off to heal underwater. Or attempted to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) The backhand, caught him off-guard! The Senju sibling was definitely quicker than the Kedoiin, which forces him to bite on his tongue fiercely. <font color = white>&#34;Owhhhhh! Sahu--&#34;</font> Followed by Kamiya&#39;s own violent outburst, though, he wouldn&#39;t give the girl the satisfaction of hitting him.

Blocking the girl&#39;s attack, he continues to whine with a damaged tongue, <font color = white>&#34;Buh, Kahiha sarhed i&#39; &#39;he ot&#39;er deh!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) accepts the yank!

He rises to his feet with her aid, a tad wobbly. He threatens to wobble in all four cardinal directions and fall again, due to the previous impact.

<font color = white>&#34;Oh wow. Can you guys stop spinning, please?..&#34;</font> He requests, before side-eyeing the spinning Hanako as well, with a faint flash of spite.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) says: Hinoue.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Batsu (The reserved preteen-Green345) asks: Could I speak with you in private?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) relentlessly attacked, delivering another kick. He seemed to think this was some sort of game--

It was not, as the blood poured from her own rakes.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) noticed Hajime&#39;s unsteadiness.

A swirl that carried him east, north, west, south! Hm! Clearly the remedy for such things was to spin him in the opposite direction, as to unwind the factors that made him dizzy in the first place! So! She grasped him by the shoulders and spun him clockwise, akin to a kid being prepared for their turn at a pinata. 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s okay! I&#39;ll just.. unspin you!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Trust me. I'm a medical professional. 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) was not.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hyuuga, Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) arched a brow inquisitively as the veiny protrusions spreading from those fainty lavender orbs would gradually soften and lose their prominence - no longer visible against skin. She wondered what could have prompted this request, but she doubts it was anything bad after witnessing her greatness just now.

<font color = white>&#34;Hm... Alright, sure,&#34;</font> she obliged, <font color = white>&#34;Lead the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) Oh no.

<font color = white>&#34;W-wait..! Unspin..? Wah..!&#34;</font>

The unspinning has the opposite effect and he finds himself teetering even more, until he threatens to collapse right onto Hanako..! A hand rises to cover his mouth, as well.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) recognized that shade of green. Why-- that&#39;s the same shade of green she took on mere moments ago, watching Maya chomp on raw fish! She frantically circled him, intent on escaping his potential spew range!

<font color = white>&#34;Ack, abort, abandon mission! It didn&#39;t work! It didn&#39;t work!&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) pulled a chair out of her pocket and took a seat on the bridge to watch the commotions until something else happened.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Seeing that the situation has escalated beyond any hope of peaceful resolution, Sakuya joins Kamiya in taking decisive action against Shun&#39;Ichi. She launches into a coordinated assault, seamlessly blending their movements into a relentless series of kicks and stomps. What unfolds could be likened to what is widely known as <font color = white>&#34;being jumped,&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) collapses to the ground, and though he keeps his mouth covered for a few moments, he soon breathes a sigh of relief.

He had avoided death itself. Or the death of his self-image for the foreseeable future.

Only after a few moments, does he tilt his head backwards while lying on the ground to finally realize that the fight was still ongoing.

<font color = white>&#34;W-woah... They&#39;re jumping that kid... &#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: Hm??
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Nah, they're just helping him out. Probably. He's clearly choking.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) passes off the fish.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: No, no... They're stomping him out...
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Hm? Just a normal day at the orphanage... kids have to be strong enough to protect themselves.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Like, when you talk back against the big kid in the orphanage..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: H-hey..! Cease this stompening!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) received a bunch of fish. She released them back to their natural habitat. 

They lifelessly float away on the current, dumped back into the river. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Goodbye, fish. Go back to peeing in the ocean, as Kami intended.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Class time...
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: In a bit.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: I wonder what will be thrown at us today..
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) felt a twinge of audacious spite creep up on his shoulders. To which he&#39;s forced to answer with his own deftness.
First order of business, getting away from Kamiya--she&#39;s the stronger one of the two, if his memory serves him correctly, so getting away from her would prove advantageous, forcing him to only deal with Sakuya.

He&#39;s never won a fight against her, though today&#39;s the day he might be given the chance to try.
Kamiya is evaded this time, with Sakuya being blocked. He uses Sakuya&#39;s weight to bounce away from the dynamic duo and more toward the riverbanks. The bell sounds, however, he knows the kids won&#39;t relent; and he doesn&#39;t plan on doing so either.
<font color = white>&#34;Coh&#39; aht meh... Bich&#39;s.&#34;</font> He states, as long as Kamiya&#39;s interrupted by Sakuya, he&#39;s safe, somewhat...</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Hey, hey! Two on one isn't fair..!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) delivers the line that had gotten him stomped out at the orphanage many times.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) was on his ass. Was she lying about him being faster? It seemed like it...

Just as a punch is about to be thrown to his cranium, though, the dancer twisted her body away and cartwheeled to a standing position.

<font color = white>&#34;I head the academy bell. You&#39;re lucky.&#34;</font> she said, to the fat-tongued boy. <font color = white>&#34;You will apologize to me after class or you&#39;re going to keep getting this.&#34;</font> It wasn&#39;t a very hard demand to meet, luckily for him.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366cc>Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) Sakuya stopped her assualt. It was time for class.

<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be inconviencing us like this Shun.&#34;</font> She shrugs as she readies herself to leave.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) breathes a sigh of relief once he sees that yet another stomping had been averted..! No doubt thanks to his efforts, as he had told them that stomping was wrong, and to cease. Clearly, this was a victory for him.

He rises to his feet after a few moments, still a bit wobbly, but he smiles regardless.

<font color = white>&#34;Y&#39;all wanna&#39; head to that lesson?&#34;</font> He asks, before his gaze focuses upon the one referred to as Shun.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, man! You alright?!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, shoot. I'm gonna be late! 
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: You're gonna be early.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: It's okay to be a little early, right?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. wait. I still haven't turned in my application. I can't be late.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: Turn it in..!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'm safe.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: No! I like the immunity! 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: You wanna' be immune to graduation, too?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: If I turn it in, they'll start keeping my lateness on record--
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: .. I'll turn it in the day before I graduate.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: It's the perfect crime.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Huh. Smart...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll go on ahead! Uh-- where's the class at? 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: West.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#12745f>Kedoiin, Shun'Ichi (The punk with twin scarves-Senin Akoihoro) blew a raspberry at Kamiya and Sakuya, moving to the snow to shove some in his mouth, hopefully it'll stop swelling soon. Though, the Kaguya's sudden advancement did muddle him slightly... Just how much quicker has she gotten in the past few days...? And how quickly could she advance?

Well, there's a limit to how much power one could produce without actively dipping their toes into the Shinobi world... Perhaps it was simply a gap in skill as opposed to some innate talent or development. Yeah... That's probably it.
He ignores Hajime, watching the duo who nearly beat his ass strut off, enviously figuring out how to get some revenge.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: This guy looks fine.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: We should all go... I'll see you there.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Which way is west--
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Guess we can head over.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'll follow him! 
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) strutted off.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: I'm marrying the vlllage!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: I'd never seen one. Wow
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: For a large bride.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: The entire village?
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) asks: Is there anyone that large?
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: The ground and all!
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: Like, everyone?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Umm...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: No, sillly!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: THE village@
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Senju, Shishorama(The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) OOCs: (!*)
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: You can't marry a villag.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) resists the urge to make a tasteless joke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) asks: Says who?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Me.
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Says me.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hah ha.. there's no one that large.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Wrong!
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Oh, wait..
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: That kid who wanted to climb!
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: If you married the village, your spouse would be sleeping with everyone here.-
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) asks: He's getting married already!?
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) yells: wow..!

<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#996633>Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) despairs at the thought!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) laughed out loud, obnoxiously.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Konoha, you cheater!
<br><font color=teal>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Sakuya (The blissful youth-MoreLife) says: Marriage is a weird concept.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) stares at Kamiya as she obnoxiously laughs, before he laughs faintly himself. He only now notices her presence, and shudders.

Why did he have to stand next to her?

He shuffles in his spot. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: What's wrong with getting some rest?
<br><font color=teal>*Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You're a weird concept!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) was confused.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b24a55>Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) turned her neck unnaturally toward Hajime; she&#39;s smirking toothily at him, but her eyes are predatory.

<font color = white>&#34;Hehehe...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kikyo (The pink haired girl-Qisame) yells: Did I make it in time?!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: No.
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: Indeed you did.
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: You're late.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: You made it!
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Tch..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: There is a time or two in here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) A single glance at her is enough to make him go completely stiff, as he straightens his posture and stares straight ahead without an ounce of relaxation possible in his physique.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I'm not going to eat you...
<br><font color=green>*Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) says: One moment. I will have to hunt for someone.
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: Just be nice to me, and we can be good friends.
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Haha...I didn't think so... I mean... 
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Uh... R-right... I can be nice...
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) yells: F-found it!
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Shishorama (The intense youngster-MidnightStroll) yells: Kamiya eats people that aren't nice to her?!
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) yells: Oh. Good job!
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I only attacked that idiot with green hair because he called me a brat. Then he called me a thing-- twice.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) overheard something scary. So, like any reasonable citizen, she looked away and whistled poorly. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: I'm not that strange...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#66ff99>Akiri, Komo (The baggy eye'd chuunin-Seventh) held up a single seal, before disappearing with parting words.

<font color = white>&#34;Class, this is Senju, Akitaru. One of the Jonin. He&#39;ll be babysitting you for abit, while I am away.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Okiku (The black-haired girl-Plemith) says: Fast..
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: I see, I see...
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Hello again, Commander Senju! 
<br><font color=green>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) says: Hi...
<br><font color=green>*Sarutobi, Yakeru (The amber-haired boy-TwistedKilla187) says: H-hello sir.
<br><font color=green>*Laro (The short dark-haired boy-Futustutus) says: Hello sir.
<br><font color=teal>*Kaguya, Kamiya (The aloof, white-haired dancer-Bonnga3) whispers: We can play tag after class.
<br><font color=green>*Nanagi (The teen with the scarred face-Tankyboy) says: Man, he looks old. Hello, I guess.
<br><font color=teal>*Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) whispers: Umm...Sure..! We can get a few friends to play tag, yes...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Senju, Akitaru (The captain-Karma_the_King) sighed softly and took center stage. He was silent, waiting for the class to settle, stareing out at each student. He memorized faces and hair styles, but more then that, ke felt for who they were.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc99ff>Uchiha, Kohaku (The sable-haired youth-Crystal232) looks to see if his cousins ever showed up- Oh, there one of them was.

<font color = white>&#34;Glad you arrived, Yuuto.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Might, Try (The bushy-browed dweeb-Dancing Dead) yells: Heyo!
