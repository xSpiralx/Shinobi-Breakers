<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) plays a melodic tune on her flute. The enchanting melody fills the air as she sits peacefully in an open space, surrounded by the beauty of nature. At the age of fourteen, she possesses a remarkable skill, captivating all who listen to her tune.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) was asleep. Dreaming of swordclashing. Samurai swinging and all that jimbo jambo. Until he heard a flute noise. Waking up he looked at the girl.<font color = white>&#34;.... Damm what&#39;s that melody..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: You like? Just a little tune of mine. My name is Asuno. What is yours?
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Soichiro

With a soft expression, the musician closes her eyes and places her soft lips upon the flute. As she exhales, a melody dances from the instrument, filling the air with light, metaphorical music notes. 

When she finished, she spoke.
        <font color = white>&#34;What do you think?&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) closed his eye&#39;s. Resting his head on his hands he relaxed. Feeling the melody it reminded him of the good days. Day&#39;s of non war. However now it was just conflict. Listening to the melody he didn&#39;t speak until the final note was played.


<font color = white>&#34;Sensational. It really good. Thank you. I feel clear and calm.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: You're welcome.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: I wonder what to do.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Other than fishing there ain't much to do.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Not much at all. It has been very quiet in this area.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I have only met two other people.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: I see
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Well  at least it's peaceful.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) asks: Say Asuno what do you plan to do in the future?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: I'll make a living selling plushies and playing my flute. What about you?
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Guess I become a samurai.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Guard people and such.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Samurai in this old town?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: How will you learn such a thing!
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Use a damm sword that's how.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: I will study the path of the sword!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) checks Soichiro for a particular item. <font color = white>&#34;...but I do not see any swords.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) has his arm&#39;s down sighing.<font color = white>&#34; Sadly I cannot have a weapon yet..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: I need a permit...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) pats Soichiro on the back. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;ll be okay. I&#39;m going to lay down and sleep for the night. I will see you later.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) cheer&#39;s up.<font color = white>&#34;Okay. Thank you and see you later Asuno.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

With a soft expression, the musician closes her eyes and places her soft lips upon the flute. As she exhales, a melody dances from the instrument, filling the air with light, metaphorical music notes.

<font color = white>&#34;Beautiful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Soichiro!
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) yells: Oh Asuno hello!
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: What's up?
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Nothing much. I was about to go fishing.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) asks: You?
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) asks: Me, nothing much. I am taking my daily walk. Where are you fishing at?
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: The lake.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: Show me where that is.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Sure.
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Ah!
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: I stepped in water.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Uh oh..
<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) says: It's okay. It'll dry.
<br><font color=green>*Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) says: Right here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) As she stepped onto the bridge, she inhaled deeply, savoring the fresh scent of the water and the gentle caress of the breeze. While closing her eyes, Asuno immersed herself in the silence of the surroundings, feeling at one with nature. 

Suddenly, she reached for her flute and brought it to her lips. 
     <font color = white>&#34;...!&#34;</font>

As the first notes flowed from her instrument, a melody filled the air, weaving through the trees and dancing across the rippling water. The sound harmonized with the peaceful ambiance, creating a magical tune that spoke straight to the heart. 
With every careful touch of her fingers on the flute, the girl breathed life into the scene, calling all who listened into a nod. The music resonated with joy.

<font color = white>&#34;I call this tune, &#39;The Bridge&#39; Entry to Heaven,&#34;</font> she recites while putting the flute away.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) smiled as he arrived at the lake. Getting his fishing rod he would start fishing while listening to the music. The calm breeze and flute playing would be heard from his ears as he continued to listen. Breathing, he used a little chakra and started walking on water with his fishing pole.


<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s a nice melody Asuno. It may help my luck with fishing. Hehe.&#34;</font> The aspiring samurai would throw his bait and rod into the water however nothing came out. He waited 5 to 10 minutes but nothing came out.

He started to become irritated as his eyes twitched. It could not be true. Was he cursed with no fish? Was this the punishment for being unlucky? However, his samurai pride was on the line. He just had to simply wait.

<font color = white>&#34;Waiting...&#34;</font>
</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) blinked, and then she blinked again. <font color = white>&#34;Huh?&#34;</font>

The expression she wore was one of shock. 
The way Soichiro effortlessly crossed the water made it appear as if it were a natural act, when it was far from it. . .
       <font color = white>&#34;Are you some type of weird fish?!,&#34;</font> she asks while slowly backing up, almost dropping her flute as a result.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asuno(The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) OOCs: (i did not see your rp post if you did post it.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Soichiro(The white haired teen.-Sora802) OOCs: (oof
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Soichiro(The white haired teen.-Sora802) OOCs: (gotta retype it sigh..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Soichiro (The white haired teen.-Sora802) sighed. He really didn&#39;t expect no fish to come out until. He heard a bite.<font color = white>&#34;Oh it&#39;s coming.&#34;</font> Getting bite&#39;s from multipule fish he would get a bucket and put&#39;s the fish inside.

Coming back toward&#39;s her he looked at Asuno confused.<font color = white>&#34;Oh this it&#39;s a basic water walking technique. Someone taught me this but it&#39;s a normal thing for ninja and samurai to do.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
