<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) is just sitting by the stall, chopsticks in hand as he eats some ramen. He seemed to be spacing out, and a little bored until he saw the red haired boy sitting nearby. <font color = white>&#34;Hey! What&#39;s up?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) shoves both hands into his pockets, only for his fingertips to be visible after going through them.

He sweats.

<font color = white>&#34;My money isn&#39;t.&#34;</font> 

A simple, curt statement before he drops his head a tad and slumps his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;You..?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Yuuto (The overconfident kid-Unknown 27) tilted his head to the side with a smirk on his face after seeing the holes in the boy&#39;s pockets. Well, he can&#39;t just ignore that! With a firm slap to the wooden counter, he easily caught the attention of the chef.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey chef! Send up two more of number 3! And slide one of those to that guy over there.&#34;</font>

It was a simple meal, noodles with pork chops, tofu and a boiled egg. Pretty great nonetheless.

<font color = white>&#34;As for me. Just my mood, that&#39;s all that&#39;s up. I&#39;m Yuuto by the way. Uchiha, Yuuto.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3300>Kibo, Hajime (The optimistic, bright boy-POD0JUAN) squints faintly once he realizes that he was with an Uchiha, and he glances away.

<font color = white>&#34;You don&#39;t have to pity me, y&#39;know? Or take care of me just because you&#39;re part of a noble clan.&#34;</font> He retorts, but his hunger was far too great to decline the meal.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll pay you back for sure... I&#39;m Hajime.&#34;</font> 

He merely breaks chopsticks and digs in quite swiftly.</font></font></font>
