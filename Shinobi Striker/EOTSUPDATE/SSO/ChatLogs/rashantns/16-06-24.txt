<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah..but i already know that
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) caught the knife - Barely, almost fumbling it and dropping it to the ground before achieving a firm grip. Deciding to work on the biggest fish first, he approached Afro&#39;s large Catfish, before tilting the knife, lining it up with the fish&#39;s eye, and spiking the knife into the fish&#39;s brain, killing it instantly.
<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s better to make sure the fish is dead before you prepare it or it&#39;ll thrash, for big fish it&#39;s easier to either spike it through the eye or to slam it against a rock REALLY REALLY hard.&#34;</font>

From there, he began to prepare the fish, spilling the catfish&#39;s guts as the Jounin approached. He pointed a free hand to Afro, the red-headed individual, while his free hand began to disembowl the fish, tossing the scraps into the water behind him.
<font color = white>&#34;Gotta get the insides out, they&#39;re not good eating. If it&#39;s a lady fish, you might find some roe inside, which is REAL good eats though, so you gotta pay attention. This one doesn&#39;t have any.&#34;</font>

From there, he descaled the fish by scraping the fish&#39;s skin with the blade of the knife, peeling off the hard, inedible scales and leaving the skin below, and once more he tossed the scraps into the water.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, so, we can eat the head too, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of it, so someone else can have that part. Now we gotta light the fire, and make a little contraption to actually cook the fish. We can just prop it up over the fire, or make a little spit for it with some sticks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) strolls slowly through the village, their elegant kimono swaying in the Amekagure breeze. They would slow their approach as they noticed the large gathering of people.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what&#39;s going on over there?&#34;</font>, they thought, looking around for a vantage point where they could see what everyone was circling. They would walk over to a tree near the commotion, their small frame dwarfed by the massive conniferous tree.

With a grunt, they would jump not very far into the air, grasping the tree and slowly beginning their climb up. It would take a few minutes before they found a branch that could hold their weight.

With a small childish squeal, they would grab the sturdy branch and sit upon it dangling their legs as they observed the crowd below.

<font color = white>&#34;WOW! That&#39;s a big fish.&#34;</font>, he said with a child like giggle.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) looked from left to right, and seeing that nobody was willing to help he let out a sigh.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, okay. I&#39;ll do it. Just... Bundle the sticks up like this, put the smaller ones on the bottom because they&#39;ll burn easier, anddd... To grill the fish, we&#39;ll grab these two sticks that kinda look like forks, and just...&#34;</font>

He jammed the two sticks into the ground, grabbing a third stick and impaling the fish from mouth through the back as if it were a spit, before propping it up over the campfire with the two Y-shaped sticks jutting from the ground.

<font color = white>&#34;Now we just need to light the fire, and then we can eat the fish. Usually someone just lights the fire for me, so uh... Help.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: There is several ways to light up the fire without ninjursu

   <font color = white>&#34;Or,&#34;</font>

She motioned to draw a rather old looking, blunt, and well-used Kunai from the confines of her sleeve. It wasn&#39;t much to look at, but it had a purpose and she was about to show it. 

A moment more and she kicked up a flat rock from the ground before she caught it, and then motioned towards the gathered bundle of sticks before she rolled the rock forward, and then followed with the Kunai. 

A brief strike, and she smeared it across the stone-face before a few sparks flickered forth. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Like so,&#34;</font>

She tossed it over towards the Hoshigaki.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Well,guess kunais have enough carbon to make sparks.

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: yeah...but  if was not that hard it won't worked.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A good bit of Kunai are made with less pure materials, thus it has a higher carbon amount.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) caught the rock, and allowed the Kunai to hit the ground by his foot rather than attempting to catch it to save his fingers, and as instructed he began to strike the rock against the Kunai&#39;s metallic surface. Of course, this began to create sparks, and as he moved the duo of tools closer to the dry scraps at the bottom of the campfire, it began to smolder, burn, and eventually, roar into an open flame, the smell of cooking fish wafting through the air after a few moments as the flame licked against the animal&#39;s flesh.

<font color = white>&#34;Boom! And that&#39;s how you cook a fish! Well- How you START to cook a fish. It&#39;s not cooked yet. This thing&#39;s probably so fresh you could eat it raw without being sick, but it&#39;s better to be safe, I think.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Also since is campfire it will take longer than a oven.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) slowly gets to his feet on the branch that he was perched on as the loud voie echoed throughout the village. His cold black eyes would flicker, as he observed everone who had been gathered scurry off. A sigh would escape his small lips.

Leaping from the branch, he would land, knees bent with a grace not often seen in a 10 year old, as he wiped the dirt and leaves from his kimono.

<font color = white>&#34;I suppose I will help out..Not like there is anything else fun to do.&#34;</font>, he said, as he ran off in the direction of the southern bridge. Before long, he would happen upon the scene of many villagers working diligently on the broken structure.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will come to the destroyed bridge,as they came they can clearly see workers from all around the village gathering to repair it,wooden planks,nails,and everything one who call himselfs a worker will be seen on the site.

The kid will talk with one of the workers and say why he was here.The workers will allow them to go and give him the nessecary stuff to begin their work.With that Najiro will begin to do their work.He will get some nails and wooden planks,alongside a hammer to slowly but surely begin to hammer and make the makeshift road for the village,while doing it he looked for any nearby supports,if they had remained from the blast.

As he finished the work he will go and rest a bit,there was more work to be done,but for now? they will rest a bit</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) made her way across the village and towards the tattered bridge. Her keen eyes scanned the surface of the descrated bridge whilst she mentally took in all the details of the carnage.

There was a lot to do. The concrete was busted, and the rails were non existant. The supports that held the bridge up themselves also seemed to be in pretty shoddy shape. 

It&#39;d take a lot of work to restore the once magnificent creation to it&#39;s former glory,  but it wasn&#39;t a task that couldn&#39;t be accomplished with some hard work. The girl quickly left the scene to go to the nearest hardware store.

After a small while she returned with a wheel barrow carrying several bags of concrete. One at a time she plopped the bags onto the ground at the entrance to the bridge.

After she emptied her cart she returned to th store to get more.

<font color = white>&#34;Asa, take these bags and begin mixing them if you would.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) Rather than assisting with the reconstruction of the bridge above-ground, Saigosame opted to take another approach. With the damage to the bridge, it was possible that the support struts of the bridge had been damaged, and even if the bridge itself was repaired, if the supports were left unobserved it could be possible that the bridge would simply crumble once more upon being repaired. As such, the Hoshigaki dove from the bridge&#39;s damaged form into the waters below, utilizing his aptitude for the water to properly observe the support struts that connected the bridge to the water&#39;s floor.

He remained underneath the water for some time, his form circling the northern points of the bridge as he looked over the concrete support struts closest to the the Village... And thankfully, there were no issues. But moving further south, where the damage was the worst, there were some glaring issues in the concrete. Cracks, where the explosion had damaged the supports, exposing the core of the concrete to the elements - And more importantly, the water.

He brought himself back up from the water&#39;s depths, shouting back up to the bridge.
<font color = white>&#34;There&#39;s a MASSIVE crack here on the supports, it needs more concrete to fill it!&#34;</font>, he yelled, before tossing up a reel of what appeared to be kelp to the bridge, essentially marking the location of the damaged support.</font></font></font>

Carrying as many as he could under each arm and wedging one between his neck and shoulder.

Asa began piling them on an empty spot of what remained of the bridge. He came back to the group to begin grabbing more debris. Hearing his name from the blond-haired thotty, he walked over and examined the bags of concrete.

<font color = white>&#34;Doesn&#39;t this seem a bit degrading for someone of my elite skills to act as a layman...&#34;</font> He thought about it for a moment. <font color = white>&#34;I guess I can show everyone I mix the best concrete in the village. Fair enough!&#34;</font> He picked up a bucket that was conveniently nearby and after emptying concrete into the wheelbarrow, collected water and poured it into the wheelbarrow. He picked up a piece of the destroyed railing (what was left of it), and began mixing. <font color = white>&#34;Prepare to witness instant perfection!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) looks around at the carnage of the destroyed bridge. The smell of concrete, sweat, and the crisp Amegakure breeze all mixing together. He would exhale deeply, not overly excited at the prospect of working hard, he much prefered leisure. 

As he looked around, he would hear his new friend <font color = white>&#34;Sharky&#34;</font> exclaim that there was a crack in one of the beams to the south of the bridge. Scanning the area, he would spot the stern boy mixing concrete amongst the sea of individuals scurrying about the bridge. 

Running over, he would exclaim: <font color = white>&#34;Hey, sharky says part of the bridge is broken under the water. I think he needs some concrete to help fill the hole. Can you give me some so that I can take it to him?&#34;</font>, he inquired.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Shark-lad. Take some of the mixed concrete and see if you can fix the beam. If it's underwater we'll have to make some sort of chimney so that we can funnel the  mixed concrete to the bad spot.
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: Don't worry blondie!
<br><font color=green>*Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) yells: I already asked this funny looking kid for some concrete to help, Sharky!

<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: I'll go get some more bags.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Nah, nah! It's above the water right now, but if the tide comes in it might flood the concrete! It should be fine to fix, but there's probably more damages south...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Break will be over and they will be called again to work.The kid will get up and this time their job was to help and make the support of the walls more stable,with that he was given the same stuff as before,but this time if he saw a hole,or anything they were told to simply try their best to fix it and then call the nearby workers to finish the support completely.Unlike before,he now had to swim,or use the new jutsu he learned in the lessons.

With that their work will start.The child will get some of the planks and use their water walk to have stability,after that was made they will go with the wooden planks and hammer and make as much as they can possible fix,so later on concrete and other materials can be put to ensure the stability of the bridge.

As he did that,he saw the next thing,and oh boy,it was underwater.Najiro had somewhat capable of chakra control,but swimming under the ocean? that was entirely new thing do try.

But as they say it was his job to do it,and he was called,he cannot backdown just now because of a issue with swimming.With that they will begin to swim and begin to hammer the planks underwater,as they did that whoever? he can feel something,their air was fastly,too fastly losing and he will drown,with that they will quickly will rush to the surface,losing their wooden planks and nails at the process.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn it..&#34;</font>He will say as he cough a bit of water which had filled their lungs.A part of the task was completed,yet it was not done the best or even decently enough by the standarts of the nearby workers and whoever was called to help.On the good side whoever? it was not a total failure either,with that the kid will take another short break,untill was called for it</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) says: I'll also help and get the planks and nails slotted in so we can put the concrete slabs over when their ready.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) submerged himself from the water, clambering up to the bridge in order to retrieve some of the mixed concrete. Thankfully, it was in a handy container by this point, but it was HEAVY, and it weighed him down as he lifted it. His brow furrowed, a sigh left his lips, and once more he shifted himself down into the water, this time taking MUCh more care in order not to spill the concrete, or otherwise contaminate it.

However, once getting down into the water, reaching the support strand wasn&#39;t much of an issue. Hefting the concrete under one arm, he threw up the Tiger seal with his free hand, utilizing the newly-learnt Suimen technique to balance himself on the water&#39;s surface as he approached the glaring cracks in the support struts. From there, it was as simple as lifting the concrete, pouring the new concrete into the crack, and then smoothing it down with a conveniently-placed trowel he had placed into his backpouch earlier. 

After a few moments, he took a step back on the water&#39;s surface, gazing at the concrete-filled crack like a proper contractor. After a quick nod, he yelled back up to the bridge.
<font color = white>&#34;Crack&#39;s fixed, I&#39;ll look for more down here! Thanks for the concrete, everyone! Teamwork makes the dreamwork, just think of the Ryo and the praise we&#39;ll get for this!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) sighed; she had appeared once more yet this time she held a selection of items atop a small cart. She groaned, and eased it over towards the northern section of the bridge. 

It was a cart of hard-hats, pink hard-hats. 

   <font color = white>&#34;So you don&#39;t all die,&#34;</font></font></font></font>

She orders several more bags of concrete then makes sure to get the necessary tools which included trowels and whatever else was necessary.

She then went by and picking up some metal that could be used as railing when they got to that point along with whatever bolts and screws could go along with it.

As she made her way back to the bridge she made sure to get some vent piping that was long enough to be submerged into the water so that they could direct the concrete towards the break in the support beneath the surface.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) yells: Besides! Five more minutes and we can we take the first of our fifteen ten minute breaks! We're only working for three hours, so it's all good!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) smiled with an icy chill towards the stern boy, as he turned his head to the wheelbarrow. His small legs would scurry towards it, slowly approaching and examing the old shoddy wheelbarrow.

<font color = white>&#34;This doesn&#39;t look very sturdy...&#34;</font>, he said, as he grasped the large handles with his small hands. WIth a comical push, he would attempt to roll the concrete, pressing his entire body against the wheel barrow, as it slowly began to move inch by inch.

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s....so...heavyyyyy.&#34;</font>, he said, as he struggled to slowly move the valuable concrete towards his shark-like comrade. <font color = white>&#34;Here I come, Sharky! I got some concrete!&#34;</font>, he said. After what felt like an eternity, he would reach the spot where the crack had been marked by the coral.

Panting and slumping down on the side of the wheelbarrow, he would yell out. 

<font color = white>&#34;Sharky! I got the concrete.&#34;</font>, his words broken by exasperated pants and gasps for breathe. <font color = white>&#34;Yuki are not meant for hard labor.&#34;</font>, he moaned.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) yells: Ah! More concrete! Thank you, new friend!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) lies on his back, staring at the sky at he attempts to catch his breathe. His small hand emerges from his kimono facing the sky, as he extends his thumb into a thumbs up sign.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) made her way to the broken bridge where things seemed gloomy and dull.With each step Rose made she would take a sip of her iced coffee before letting out a loud sigh.Once reaching the bridge the Ju would remove her shades as her hair blew in the wind which gave off as if she was an important figure.With a snap of her finger a group of big muscluar man would appear behind Rose awaiting her order

<font color = white>&#34;I see....Hmmm you!&#34;</font>she said while pointing to one of the help<font color = white>&#34;Make sure you fix this light pole here I don&#39;t want to walk down this bridge and someone try to steal my purse.&#34;</font>the big construction worker would nod their head as they quickly ran to do what the senju demanded them to do.A single sweat dropplet can be seen flowing down her face.

<font color = white>&#34;Telling people what to do is sure is draining..&#34;</font>she said in way as she was flexing her wealth to get things done.A couple of hours would pass and Rose can be seen sitting on a chair while fanning herself,but suddenly the construction workers she paid for would stop what working  in unison and begin to walk away from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;HEY! Where are you going!&#34;</font>she yelled as one of the construction workers would hand the Senju a piece of paper which was a receipt <font color = white>&#34;-Sorry ma&#39;am but you only had us for couple of hours based off what you were able to afford.&#34;</font>said the construction worker.

This made the senju embarrassed because it&#39;s clear she spent the last of her ryo on this expensive kimono which was worth it for her.A sigh would escape the ju as she would pick up a hammer and begin to hammering  a single nail that she noticed wasn&#39;t hammered all the way in<font color = white>&#34;Hard to find good help these days.&#34;</font>she said while wiping her face off due the amount of energy it took to hammer that nail.

<font color = white>&#34;Hopefully the old man will give me more money.&#34;</font>she said walking off while also practing her sad puppy dog face in order to convince her old man to give her more money.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;No, no, no. This doesn&#39;t look right at all!&#34;</font> he exclaims, while squinting at his plans.

He then flips the plans over, <font color = white>&#34;Ohh, okay. I see. I&#39;m Contractor Kreig.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Will get out of the break he had given to himself,as they did that they will begin the final part of their workday.The workers told him they need concrete for the bridge handle parts.The handles were already made,just they needed to pour the concrete around the parts and make it cool off.With that the workers gave the conrete mix to the kid and told him to put it into the machine.

Najiro will follow their intructions.As the mix was finished they told him to pour it carefully and without putting too much.As Najiro did what they said he either due to stress or just worrying put on each of them too much.This dissapointed the workers,but they called a kid afterall.

And just like that, he was back into the water, the container of concrete hefted above the surface as he continued to inspect the support strands. The damage was substanciaal, but most of it seemed to be above-water, causing for easy fixes with the application of the concrete mixed by his fellows.

However, one strand gave him pause. Resting the concrete on the strand, he dove under the water, and felt a chill down his spine. There was a fairly substancial crack, from the top of the support strand all the way down to the water&#39;s floor. It took a few moments, but he came back up and immediately yelled out to his fellows.

<font color = white>&#34;Oiiii! BIG crack here! It&#39;s all the way down to the surface, uhhh... Blondie! Chimney idea, do you think you can pull that off?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

With the few little clacks of his sandles he arrived with a very large bundle. He was going to have to make several round trips. He was certainly that this bridge built in part with child labour would entirely hold up. Though he wouldlook over to the hard hats being given out. 
<font color = white>&#34;Do I need to wear one of these even if I am just delivering food to the folks working here?&#34;</font> He calls out having brought plenty of cooled drinks as well.

<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: You'll want to drill the bolts at least six inches deep into the concrete to anchor the railings.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) held swiftly tossed down the neon pink hardhat down towards his cousin within the depths. Was the least he could do before getting his hands dirty himself.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) did, indeed, catch the hardhat with his free hand, strapping it on top of his straw hat in an almost awkward configuration.</font></font></font>

Asa kicked a rock into the water, immediately lifting his leg and grabbing his foot <font color = white>&#34;Ow ow ow ow!&#34;</font> Immediately, he regretted his decision of kicking the rock with his shoeless foot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) mosied on over and picked up that pipe with the strength of a man whom has been doing hard labour his whole life.

<font color = white>&#34;Darn wife wants me to go to the doctor, but we got a deadline to meet.&#34;</font> the man mumbled to himself as he made his way back over towards the edge.

Without much care he began to drop the pipe straight towards the Hoshigaki in the water. Hopefully he was good at catching round, awkward things with sharp edges.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) had just managed to put the hardhat on as the pipe lowered down towards him, and he just managed to avoid the sharp point as it plunged down towards him. He did, however, manage to grab the pipe before it fully submerged. With that, he yelled up to his fellow Hoshigaki.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay! Okay. Great. Good. Yo Cous, wanna come give me a hand with this? We gotta keep the concrete dry with this pipe while we fill these cracks. We can probably leave the pipe in there once we&#39;re done and fill THAT with concrete too. You down?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded. She seemed to wander over towards Najiro with no true hurry in her movement - as she eased into place? She produced several bolts from behind her back, she was prepared. 

It didn&#39;t take much for her to simply drive them into place with but a flick of her hand, a bit of raw muscle, and they were slammed into home. She repeated such actions as required for each bolt. 

It took only a moment or two. 

   <font color = white>&#34;There we are,&#34;</font>

She returned to her place shortly after.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) was, simply put, waiting for the magic words to be spoken. Asking a half-shark kid to hop into water was akin to asking if a junkie wanted another fix. With a small grin, the boy vaulted over the guard-rail. His body submerging within the body of water beneath the bridge. Awaiting orders and ready to work, he stood - or swam, rather.

       <font color = white>&#34;For sure, beats staying up there, plus, swimming is so much more fun t&#39;me. Jus&#39; tell me what t&#39;do and I got it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) hopped across the bridge and next to the half-shark boy. <font color = white>&#34;Hey there, what&#39;s up!&#34;</font> He said with a slight maniacal glint in his eye. <font color = white>&#34;You guys are doing some good work over here.

<br><font color=green>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) asks: Haha just kidding. I'm sure you and your cousin don't eat shoes... Right?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Chicken.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) yells: Yeah, just- Just hold the pipe against the crack and make sure the other end is above the water so I can pour in the concre- WE DIDN'T EAT YOUR SHOES, BUDDY!

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm fine with any snack, personally.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oi, oi- Actually, now that I think about it. That fish should be done now. It's just by the big pillar.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: You can grab that for everyone, if you want.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yuki, Amehara (The cold child-RashanTNS) sighs and pouts at the words of the dark-skinned dancer. He would slowly walk towards the village, dragging his feet while lifting his kimono as to not sully it.  A visible scowl/pout on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;This is not fun at all...&#34;</font>, he mumbled as he headed deeper into the village, the sound of yelling and footsteps disappearing behind him. After a 10 minute walk, he would arrive on the steps of a large building with a large bright neon sign reading <font color = white>&#34;Ame Convenience&#34;</font>.

A sigh escapes his lips, as he enters and begins collecting packages of water. He would make multiple trips from the isles to the counter as he stacked 3 cases of water onto the counter.

A trickle of sweat would slide down his small brow, as he wiped it away with his sleeve. He would then head towards the back of the store and begin grabbing bags of ice. They were surprisingly less hefty than he had expected. 

<font color = white>&#34;Hey, do you happen to have something I can carry all this in? They wanted me to make multiple trips but I dont think that is going to work. It will take forever.&#34;</font>, he politely asked the shopkeep. He would explain his work at the bridge and how he had been assisting with rebuilding the destroyed bridge.

After a long discussion, they would be directed to the shops horse and buggy which he would loan the child only due to it being a mission to assist the village. After paying for the supplies, the small child would load all of his material into the horse and buggy, getting into the carriage and grabbing the reigns. 

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you, sir!&#34;</font>, he said, before quickly having the reigns snatched by the shopkeep who also entered the buggy. Apparently letting a 10 year old disappear with his only method of transporting his stock was too much to ask.

With a pout the two would slowly head back towards the bridge, the large stockpile of water and ice bouning in the carriage. As they approached all of the busy works scurrying around the bridge, they would wave. </font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) followed the Black haired males lead and began helping point out the bolts that needed to be drilled intot he rail. He creates a half-ram seal activating his Dojutsu to get a better view and get the spots the Black haired male could not see.

<font color = white>&#34;Byakugan....There are more over there Lady! Further down from where you bolted the others.&#34;</font> he said pointing down to where they were. </font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: YOU ALL GET THREE MINUTES TO HAVE A DRINK AND A SNACK BEFORE WE RESUME.
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) yells: WE HAVE A DEADLINE TO MAKE!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The work in progress-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ..A deadline?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00ccff>Yuki, Aoi (The soft featured boy-Sirhelgate) Would have left to assist the cold boy with his moving of the water and ice. All things considered they would haul it on along. Pushing it back and forth to the best of their ability. Though he would move from the other to Foreman Kreig. His hands lugging the two large jugs of iced tea on over to the man. <font color = white>&#34;Here you are sir.&#34;</font> His arms was shaking eeever so faintly. He was ill suited to physical work!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) nodded; she eased back over once more - and this time towards the Hyuuga that had pointed out the locations. She took it upon herself to quickly jostle a series of bolts into place much like before - a few brief flicks of her wrist, and she slammed several of them home. 

   <font color = white>&#34;Very well,&#34;</font>

She chuckled, and eased back over towards her spot once more. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Contractor Kreig (The contractor kreig-Kristuria) says: YOU! GET A TROWEL AND START SMOOTHING OUT THE CONCRETE THEY JUST POURED ON THE SUPPORT BEAM.

Having only just arrived, the sudden gathering of blue-collared &#39;workers&#39; caught the girl by surprise. It didn&#39;t help that someone had already taken time to outright demand something of her.

     <font color = white>&#34;Is this some new way of asking for help..?&#34;</font>

She murmurs, her eyes trailing from the loud contractor to the crowd of youth.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) did as instructed by his older cousin, keeping a firm grip on the pipe. Whilst being utterly clueless in the eyes of stuff like this - Jinbeisame caught on quite quickly. The boy's grip tightening around the pipe as the concrete was soon to be poured. Or at least it was until the mention of a <b>THREE. MINUTE. BREAK</b>. Was this the life of the men behind the repairs of the village? A simple three-minute break? A silent prayer was made that he never failed as a Shinobi and would have to submit to <i>this</i> layer of work.</font></font></font>

I just need you to make it smooth before it dries.&#34;</font> he continued on towards the center of the bridge where concrete had just been poured into the support and more of the genin were starting to work on the railing.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) began to pour the concrete into the pipe held firm by his younger cousin, motioning him to tilt the pipe further and further as the pipe itself began to fill with concrete. This, was the best way to go about fixing such a crack - Otherwise, the concrete would become damaged by the water, and due to the sharp point of the pipe, it would be easy enough to lodge it in the ground, creating a solid pillar of concrete within the crack itself to maintain structure. The surface level could be fixed traditionally, but underwater, the concrete would become waterlogged. Thankfully, two shark-men are better than one.

<font color = white>&#34;Eh, break? Three minutes...? We&#39;re not exactly doing anything strainworthy here just yet, we can just save our three minutes and take a six-minute break later. Keheheheh!&#34;</font>, he barked out, as he eventually filled the pipe with concrete. 
<font color = white>&#34;Okay, now just put it flush into the crack, lean it all the way vertical so the point is digging into the ground at the bottom, and we can fill the top part. This thing&#39;s just a solid concrete-steel pole at this point, it&#39;ll keep this strut held good.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Like this?&#34;</font>

A quick hand pushed down upon it; clearly far too hard. Rather than make the material smooth, she actually left a rather large indent within it.</font></font></font>

With this leverage Kreig effortlessly lifted the boy from the ground and held him over the ledge of the bridge.

He would scan the workers around the area attempting to gain knoweldge on how he should be performing his work. After a few moment, he would follow the contractors example.

He would smile as the contractor marched over the stern boy and lift him off the ground holding him over the edge of the bridge.

With that the construction worker simultaneously released his grip on the boy&#39;s shirt and took a firm grasp of his pants. Giving him the most gnarly wedgie imaginable.

Yet again, the mirror&#39;s the man&#39;s words. Her hands move once more, a standard attempt at imitating what he had displayed for her. She presses softer into the ground this time with the tool. There doesn&#39;t come a hard bit of damage like before... but the area certainly isn&#39;t the smoothest to anyone with a good eye.

For an amateur, it was all one could really expect.

     <font color = white>&#34;I guess.. As long as this thing pays.&#34;</font>

She continues with her attempt, a few bits and bobs of concrete manipulation until the area was, in her eyes, complete.</font></font></font>

Wriggling and desperately attempting to free himself from the contractor&#39;s hold on his undies, he said <font color = white>&#34;Fine! Fine! Just let go!&#34;</font> and with a whimper, finished with, <font color = white>&#34;This is child abuse...&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Now shadowing the actions of his relative. 
                 <font color = white>&#34;Like this, right? Or am I being to loose along the steel pipe..?&#34;</font>, he spoke, his words coming off as a new employee seeking affirmation.

The actions of what went on above his head caught little of his attention. Though the audible noise of a kids underwear <i>ripping</i> caught his attention for a short while. A cringed expression spreading across his face but you know..

The man then went over to examine the shark&#39;s work. <font color = white>&#34;Lookin&#39; good shark boys. I&#39;ll have you two come up and here and get ready to pour the new surface for the bridge as soon as wedgie boy here finishes the forms.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
