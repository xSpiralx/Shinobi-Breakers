The massive hound would bark a few times. The Inzuka would nod his head a few times <font color = white>&#34;Ha to funny Kane to funny.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only look at Nunya, as he would shake his head. <font color = white>&#34;Why would we know, when were not yet full shinobi?&#34;</font> he would then turn to the Inuzuka that was also the police chief, giving him a nod.

<font color = white>&#34;Well nice to officially meet you chief, names Himotachi, Sora, and this one is my brother Takuma.&#34;</font> they would point to the Ambitious one who had been a bit quiet till then.

<font color = white>&#34;A pleasure to meet you chief and aye, you seem quite straight forward.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) stares blankly at the barking dog. He would tilt his head slightly inquisitively, as the man spoke to the dog, almost as if he understood it.

<font color = white>&#34;Uh...You speak dog?&#34;</font>, he asked, his eyes settling on the animal once again.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) has decided to take a walk from the compound of his clan to the Kage manor where he was supposed to sign up for the academy and figure out what is going on in this village nowadays. Since he became of age to join Shinobi ranks, Gosame was really excited and eager to meet new people.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder what my boss would say to this...maybe I should wait for him?&#34;</font>

He would think while walking with his hands firmly placed at back of his head. Step by step he was slowly in front of the manor where he wonders what this group of people has gathered around for. In a friendly manner he smiles and joins them.

<font color = white>&#34;Erm...hello. I am Gosame and I am looking for someone to sign me up in the academy?&#34;</font>

Tall boy inquires, his skin was slowly turning blue as well due to their pigmentation that Hoshigaki get once when they become of age.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I see, well then I will have to go with secondary option....unfortunate.&#34;</font>

Gosame smiles to those that have introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to have heard at least one name...its nice to meet you Sora.&#34;</font>

After saying that with quite friendly tone, Gosame repositions his hands into his hoodie pocket since his hands were slowly going numb.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would shrug his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Right sure....I suppose.&#34;</font> honestly alot of them were quite interesting, but quite a bit out there as well as he would move towards the building sitting down on the sidewalk, leaning against it, as he opened up a bag and took out a book to read.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hm....I mean if you think like that, it could help you fight like you were prey....adrenaline shortcut maybe
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I am not an illusion? Is prey confused?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) sighs and shakes his head, ignoring the further comments of Yoru. This certainly was an interesting group of people, but he had no time for games. He would head to the front of the academy and wait for an instructor to arrive.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where did everyone go?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) was confused a little bit by the arrival of Yoru. He did not know how to teach his kin about the conversation and proper etiquette of other Shinobi in the village that they protect.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh...well....prey is something we hunt down and play with or hunt down and eat....but I am sure that Yoru doesnt mean it on a bad side.&#34;</font>

Gosame has begun to explain, he was wondering just why is Yoru constantly calling people prey. Was he not taught how to talk properly in public? Regardless, he didnt want to be a smartass and call him out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) would cough a few times Yoru&#39;s smell was crazy bad <font color = white>&#34;Hey.. This has to be a crime.&#34;</font> he says his eyes watering a bit.

His hound Kane would Bark at the Smelly teen.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Ah I get it...that&#39;s okay, if he treats his enemies as prey, he&#39;ll get along with me just fine!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: If he does not, big boss will put him in place.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only nod to them before turning to the chief. <font color = white>&#34;So, chief whats one gotta do to join the police force anyways, figured I would ask and see what happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's a good question
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Bad side? Prey is prey. No good or bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) stretched her arms over her hea, <font color = white>&#34;Huh.. where did everyone go?&#34;</font> She&#39;d wonder.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Everyone is here, few people left but thats about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) asks: Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looked at the hound, tilting his head.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, prey? Hungry? I&#39;m not prey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) looks over to sora. <font color = white>&#34;To join the force.. The minimum requirement would to be a genin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;We have a long path ahead of us, especially to become Genin. That one is really important.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read his book as he listened to the chief, when his question was answered. <font color = white>&#34;Well that is good to know chief, I might have to join when I am able to then...I think that with my skills I might be a great addition, but of course that also remains to be seen.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: My name?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Yep.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) tilted her head to the side as she eyed the sharp-toothed kid.
     <font color = white>&#34;My name&#39;s Reimi..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) gives Sora a heads up <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I am Hoshigaki Gosame. Its nice to meet you Reimi.&#34;</font>

He says with wide and happy smile, he came here to meet new people and sign up to attend the academy and become Genin to begin with.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I knew she lied.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Reimi makes more sense.

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: A question though. Did anyone sign up at all? Because if not....we can just camp the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue reading as he flipped to another page. <font color = white>&#34;I believe that is exactly what we are doing currently Gosame.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would point to the big building everyone is infront of.. <font color = white>&#34;This is the accademy, but it was empty when I was inside just a bit ago, still it is good to know a name of someone to look for.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) points to the building next to them with his index finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Apparently, according to the people that have been signed up already that is the academy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: I'm on my way then!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: Thanks!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Here I am again
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But there is....nobody inside I think.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: Where is the instructor?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) looks to the academy and back then blinks.

<font color = white>&#34;What in the...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Least no one was Gosame when I was in there last, and no one seemed to come in and out that I have seen, I can easily go look again
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Indeed it is still empty
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I need to start my training.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: We all have to train hard in and out of the academy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (im sorry but uh Allies within 3 tiles of a Sarutobi are bolstered by their leadership, gaining +5 to strength, speed and stamina. At Chuunin levels this boosts the range to 6 tiles and at Jounin it peaks at 10 tiles.  the fuck? this ss seems broken as hell)
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hai we will.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (Thats crazy.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (aye )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Uhm... what? That's crazy)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: So many preys around now.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (yeah, was looking at trees and bam stumbled on that gem)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kotsuki, Damuri(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (kaguya looks broken)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Geto, Takeshi(The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (Even in their last moments , the greatest leaders can find a way to inspire. When taking Critical damage, the Sarutobi gains +1 Grade to speed when moving to defend an attack for an ally with the intention of taking damage. Should the member of the Sarutobi clan die from this, their allies will gain a second wind of the Will of Fire , recieving B chakra and recovering Light to their current health.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (kaguya might seem good but sarutobi seems straight gorked)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders while wondering about what Yoru was talking to them about. Calling people <font color = white>&#34;prey&#34;</font> is not something that should be done in public but Gosame had no say in it.

<font color = white>&#34;Yoru...one day you will call someone prey and they will beat you up. Be careful.&#34;</font>

Gosame would say with worried tone, thinking that Yoru might have some sort of brain damage.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read as he would look at the others, he had studdied about various applications and so fourth just basic information on different techniques.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me, do you guys have any interests, plan to specialize in anything?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Inuzuka, Mosai(The police chief-VantetheGreat) OOCs: (its okay guys i got an inside man planning the Sarutobi massacare)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) thinks about it for a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;That is a good question, I will have to talk to big boss in what we excell in and all that. Probably suiton? We are sharks afterall.&#34;</font>

Gosame would say while moving his left hand to his chin in order to think.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) quickly nods his head,

<font color = white>&#34;I want to study taijutsu further than the readings I&#39;ve seen have. I want to go as far as my body possibly can&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would nod to the others, he had heard what they wished to specialize in, as hee would continue to read. <font color = white>&#34;I plan to master the blade, as well as use my formidiable mind to enforce my will on others.&#34;</font> he would say this casually.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yasuke (The gaped boy-Tet. Jr) says: Smells like shit out here.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) scratched the side of her head, <font color = white>&#34;So what do I do now?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would flip to another page casually. <font color = white>&#34;Well we wait, untill the instructor appears for thoose of us who have yet to sign up for the academy Reimi.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;I usually go for a swim when I am bored but...I guess you guys cant reach the depths where I go. But waiting for the instructor is also a thing, so who knows, one might pop up at any given moment.&#34;</font>

Gosame has said just to walk over to the wall and lean onto it.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yasuke (The gaped boy-Tet. Jr) says: My neck/

<font color = white>&#34;Are any of you working age perhaps? I have a delivery to make to a....Takumi Mines?&#34;</font> They&#39;d say checking the documents</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would arrive once more as they would sit down on the ground, taking out a book once more..it was a bit interesting that they had yet to see the actual accademy master..

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Prey has to show how old they are?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (the real question is would we still get paid if we joined your squad..)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (or only you.)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (im fourteen, but mainly probably cause there is nothing to spend on, im curious if the other library has jutsu and its probably cause people are using them to exploit exp or something)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would move over to the side, leaning up against the building as they would take out a book, looking at the others. <font color = white>&#34;So I take it we are all still waiting on the accademy? Though there are several new faces that I havent met yet it would seem.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) The child makes a sad face, but he does realize how informal it was.
 <font color = white>&#34;Awww.. okay, I&#39;ll call you sora mister.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) looked at Gilly for a second for a second skin as blue as the water he shrugged for a moment as he looked at the kid and then to Sora he started to wonder how the 14 years wasn&#39;t an genin.

<font color = white>&#34;Ohh Interesting so we&#39;ll all behind haha, i join late too.&#34;</font> he stated as he prepared the path of becoming a ninja rather than being a cook like his dad.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) To be fair, Gilly didn&#39;t know how old he was. Being only 4&#39;7 and having such soft fish features, one could assume he was anywhere between five and ten. Eitherway, he shrugs his shoulders grinning.
 <font color = white>&#34;Four and teen? That&#39;s pretty old!&#34;</font> 

 He looks over at E nodding. <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re four and teen too!?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Was it Reimi?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) chuckled

<font color = white>&#34;They must have been pretty ugly for you to think they were a man.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ezekiel (The blue-hair teen-LegitC) quickly covered his mouth as he seem to be gross out.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yoshimitsu (The black-haired youth-Neorellik26) says: ..Man what were you guys talking about.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Namiro (The black haired kid-Colem) says: I think that is something to be jailed for.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Stain (The gilly rock boy-Bigwestcarter) yells: Papa says when you drop a egg, you're mating!
