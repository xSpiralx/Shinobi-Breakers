<br><font color=green>*Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) yells: Hey!
<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) asks: Hm?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) shifts his attention away from his shop to attend to the blonde girl. 

<font color = white>&#34;What do you think you&#39;re doing near my forge, missy?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) throws her hands into the air. She wanted the merchant to drop his guard and realize how harmless she was.
      <font color = white>&#34;Woah, my bad mister. I was checking out the area.&#34;</font>

The teenager places her palms together, lines connected. 
With a bend, she respectfully bows, displaying manners to add on to her show.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) sizes up the lass, before frowning. A sour look was visible on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;Ick. Well, don&#39;t just stand there, girl. Tell me your name and tell me who dressed you in those rags.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) was dressed in relaxed attire.
She swiftly arranges her blonde bang after straightening from the bow. <font color = white>&#34;Certainly, sir,&#34;</font> she replies.

With grace, she retrieves a golden flute and plays a captivating melody for the merchant. The musical enchantment is soothing, to the extent that it seems as though the notes spring to life, swirling around them as she performs. The lackluster surroundings are infused with vibrant hues, accompanied by an attractive head nod of her music..
....she paused.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Asuno. These garments were passed down to me by my sickly mother.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) lessens his scowl as the music flows amongst them. A calming melody soothed his heart. His aggressive demeanor soon dissipates, as he nod his head several times in Asuno&#39;s direction.

<font color = white>&#34;Junji. Junji Ogura. Seems like you possess some talent. Are you a street performer?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) says: Oh, my. Child, I didn't recognize you. You're filthy.

The reply is followed by a stretch with her left hand pushing down into her right palm, arm pits exposed.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) stares daggers at his adopted daughter.

<font color = white>&#34;Greet her quickly or it&#39;s back to the mines with you.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9999>Asuno (The flute playing gal-MyThridKey) looks between the two with a hint of concern.
