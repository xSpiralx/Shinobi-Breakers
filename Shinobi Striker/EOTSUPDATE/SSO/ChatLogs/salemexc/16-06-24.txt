<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) picks his nose without a care in the world, knowing that no one can tell him anything due to the inherent values of Confucianism that are deeply rooter in our modern day society and that demand respect toward the elderly.

<font color = white>&#34;During my days Akihabara was a more lively place to live in.. what have the youth done to my village..&#34;</font> he sighs as he complains about the youth like any respectable old man would do.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) turns toward the direction of the old man, scoffing in his direction.

<font color = white>&#34;Give it time, old fart. Akihabara will flourish soon.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) turns toward the only other individual with the decency of still running a business within the great economic center that was Akihabara.
Unfortunately. the old man could neither see or hear well, barely registering the merchant&#39;s appearance as something blurry.. while completely misunderstanding his words..

<font color = white>&#34;Give me fart, Akihabara flour soup..? Tsk tsk..&#34;</font> he repeats, before shaking his head in disappointment <font color = white>&#34;Fart this, fart that.. kids these days..Your sales pitch is weak lad. You need to work on that!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#bcbc5e>Ogura, Junji (The flamboyant merchant-Salemexc) waves off the elder, a disinterested look visible on his face. He returns checking his inventory, a moment passes before he speaks.

<font color = white>&#34;Akihabara may have fallen on hard times, but we&#39;ll return to that golden age of prosperity.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Wu  (The senile old man-Expami) grumbled to himself, missing half of the words the fellow merchant spoke. Though what little he had heard made him nod approvingly.

<font color = white>&#34;That&#39;s right lad! You are a smart cookie, you&#39;ll go far.&#34;</font> he squints in an attempt to see the merchant&#39;s face, only to be met by the harsh reality that was his failing sight <font color = white>&#34;I am sure you already know, but if you don&#39;t, then let this old man give you some information.&#34;</font> he coughs, clearing his throat <font color = white>&#34;Rain and Rocks are the future of commerce! Keep an eye out on those two villages.. in a year or two they will become a good source of business.&#34;</font>

While his words were fancy, the content was... common knowledge. <font color = white>&#34;Now.. this old man will leave to your job.&#34;</font> he moves away, walking as slowly as one would expect form the elderly</font></font></font>

       <font color = white>&#34;...this is one of my favorite songs.&#34;</font> 
                    [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF4z5kntXAA] 

With a soft expression, the musician closes her eyes and places her soft lips upon the flute. As she exhales, a melody dances from the instrument, filling the air with light, metaphorical music notes.

<font color = white>&#34;Beautiful.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
