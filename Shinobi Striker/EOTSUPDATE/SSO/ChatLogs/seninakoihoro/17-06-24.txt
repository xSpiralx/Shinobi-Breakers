<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) smiled at the boy before they looked at the one who arrived and also their current oponent - the plan seemed clear enough. She ran next to Meixun, being by his side step by step. Just as she did however, the girl got a very nice idea.

<font color = white>&#34;Meixun, keep him busy for just one moment - then I&#39;ll give you a chance!&#34;</font>

Fubuki had no time to think of how Yurei could act when he wandered into the fight, but it was best they focus on one enemy at a time regardless.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (actually, meixun next turn can i go first?)

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) watched them both basically jump the poor heavy sod.
  <font color = white>&#34;And it goes like this again. . .&#34;</font> He sighed to himself, not too keen on allowing the chubby one to be jumped.

  Yurei had already been teamed up on once and grew a distaste for it in this circumstance. Besides, he was their next target.

   <font color = white>&#34;Hey big guy, when the opening is clear snatch the banner.&#34;</font>

The Mugen pivots into the air, bounces off the wall and then primes himself for to snatch the first streamer on her hip.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) or a snatch on the first streamer on her hip<i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) his opponets were rushing towards him. This made things so much easier.
The Akimichi would lash out with  his left hand in attempt to grab a hold of Meixun. If he was sucesss ful he'd aim to lift them by the front of their shirt and slam them into the ground.

He would then hear Yurei's words and nod his head.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) glanced at her side only to see someone incredibly fast reaching out for her streamer - she just barely managed to avoid it being snatched. It got the better of her however, she knew she wouldn&#39;t last long and instead of trying to defeat her opponent in a futile attempt she opted to go for her original idea.

After the Akimichi&#39;s attack she&#39;d open her arms wide and hug him much like the Meixun did with her earlier. She used everything she had to hopefully keep the Akimichi in place while her teammate attacked.

<font color = white>&#34;Take his streamer before I lose mine! If I go down it&#39;ll be in a blaze of glory!!&#34;</font> she said a bit too dramatically for the current moment.
[D- agility so 0/1 DT, grappling Akimichi]</font></font></font>

  <font color = white>&#34;Lemme see that.&#34;</font> He follows after being evaded.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Yurei(The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) OOCs: (its just my strain then)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) took the opportunity of distraction to switch targets. As long as Fubuki has a hold of Chonamu, the Akimichi shouldn't be too grand of an issue... right?
Fubuki's words reached him naturally, though the highest option available was to interrupt Yurei's swiping, because... Well overcoming greater opponents was the name of the game. 

He slipped out of his overcoat the moment Chonamu took ahold of it Meixun's right foot dug into the tiled floor below, allowing him to pivot solidly and make a straight dash for Yurei's person. In a span of a few seconds, the younger Zhu solidly dispels Yurei's hand with his shoulder, stopping the attempt and attempting to vye the youth's attention.

Change of plans, it begins here.

She entered a grappling match with an Akimichi.. They were in the academy so there was lessons to be learned.

The Akamichi would wrap his arms around the  girl creating his own  bear hug. He&#39;d smile.. <font color = white>&#34;Lets Play a Game called Domino.&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (losing tthe tiles is for when u bodyblock, afterwards u can move i believe)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (so if he alrdy blocked tthen its fine)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (that being said turn order got messy so i also kinda lost track of things)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Mugen, Yurei(The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) OOCs: (oh ok. the turn of the bodyblock movement is forfeited. just reread)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) thoughtt her plan worked when she surrounded her arms against the Akimichi - but what she wasn&#39;t expecting was how strong her opponent. In a horrible turn of events now she was the one getting hugged. Fubuki chuckled nervously.

<font color = white>&#34;So uh, how about we team u--&#34;</font>

Her eyes widened in terror as he was threatening to fall on top of her. This wasn&#39;t even about the fight anymore, he was threatening to put her in the hospital.

<font color = white>&#34;YOU KNOW YOU CAN&#39;T HURT EACH OTHER RIGHT?!&#34;</font>

It was a miracle as she slipped past him, her body crouched and then turned to the side before being turned into mashed potatoes. Even if the Akimichi was holding back his strength Fubuki was terrified nonetheless.

Then she glanced at what was happening next to her - her teammate got one of his streamers popped. Knowing there was no way to defeat the Akimichi she turned around and also lunged towards Yurei, trying to quickly grab one of his streamers in a most likely futile attempt.

Kicking into a more aggresive gear, the boy fiends for an opening, unrelenting with his strikes despite being on the backfoot of their situation.

<font color = white>&#34;Continuous disproportion...!&#34;</font> He commands Fubuki, just a strange way to say &#39;&#39;keep stalling&#39;&#39; if nothing else.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) had no idea of what to do since her teammate was getting attacked by someone far better than him, and she was getting attacked by someone far better than her. It was pretty desperate but she ran a bit forward to avoid the lunge and being grabbed, at that moment she realized her opponent might as well be trying to put her in the hospital for real.

<font color = white>&#34;The belt! Go after THE BELT.&#34;</font> she yelled out to her opponent while once more moving her arm towards Yurei&#39;s waist and snatch his banner , perhaps if she got lucky enough she could take one of his banners though she doubted it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Mugen, Yurei (The slit-eyed youth-Mirageman) legitimately dropped to the ground and spun on his shoulder with great momentum, kicking up a small debri storm of germs, fecal matter, undried urine, and dirt from shoe rubbers - dodging both their attempts at getting his banner.

   <font color = white>&#34;Ghg, ghg, ghg.&#34;</font> He tensed before trying to kick off the remaining streamer by Meixun&#39;s beltside.
[2/4]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) wasn't focused at all on his remaining streamer before feeling a wiff of air dart into swiping at Yurei. It was Fubuki! She escaped? Wait--who was Yurei targetting in the first place?!

Questions for after the fact, he supposed for now, it's time to swap targets once again. Meixun relents, exiting the conversation of battle for that short moment to designate what exactly Chonamu's next plan would result in. If things came to another rotation--perhaps everyone can get out of this with... One less streamer, if that's still the overarching goal.
His legs push him away just enough for Yurei's attempt to fall short, he huffs slightly. The dilemma was, pretty obvious by now: Fubuki's going to have to lose a streamer for this to work, all he needs to do is hope she can handle what brunt is guaranteed.

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Fubuki(The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) OOCs: (also just to clarify, for dt im counting down not up so i have only 1 turn left, figured i miight say it since i just realized im doing itt differently)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (gotcha gotcha)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) it appeared that his method of imboilizing his targets and just taking both streamers was a bit ineffectivine. He&#39;d notice that Yurei was hell bent on getting his partners streamers. with her preoccupied he&#39;d lash out and aim to snatch her streamer away.

He not that Mexiuan was runining around but there was only one exit.. And he was closest to it.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) was unsuccesful on her attempt of getting Yurei&#39;s banner once more, and yet she just barely managed to step away from the Akimichi and avoid getting her banner caught once more. She was panting, clearly tired from all the effort - then suddenly an announcement rang through the whole village, though they were in the girl&#39;s toilet they could still hear it.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay, unless we all agree to call it quits I ain&#39;t stopping yet! FOR VICTORY, OR A DRAW AT LEAST!&#34;</font>

Once more she reached out her arm for Yurei&#39;s banner...she was really tired though.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) noticed, then, that he was on the wrong side of the arena...

<font color = white>&#34;Oh. Okay, I&#39;ll only show you...&#34;</font> She stepped back. <font color = white>&#34;If you use your ninja training to jump across the water.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) let out an exascerbated sigh, looking at his clothing for a few moments. He still wasn't well versed enough to trot upon water just yet, so he'll need to settle with more.... Improvisational practices.

He formulates a few seals he remembered from a scroll read, then he lifted his undershirt, folding the linen neatly into a triangular plate before creasing each edge with both hands. Undoing the metallic string that held his tailed hair in the back--his hair's apparently getting longer--he wraps it around the congruent angle's point, folding that down to support the shape.

All of this was to make some sort of makeshift throwing item, to which the boy flexes his quads to toss off to the other side! Unfortunately for his aim, he ends up hitting Kitusmi, having said item dangle to the ground unceremoniously. Though there wasn't much of any time to react to that, he mosies over toward Fubuki, poking her before hissing a whisper.</font></font></font>

As Meixun got closer he'd hear a very small snore coming from Fubuki, she was standing still and not moving except for her breathing. The boy's poke however woke her up and immediately she looked kinda around, confused and unaware of what was going on. It took her a moment to realize Meixun wanted to talk to her, so she lowered herself to hear him better. The girl thought about what the boy said before whispering something back.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) honestly had no idea what the boy said earlier but it seemed like she kinda understood it by the end. Regardless the sleepy girl also followed the boy, right behind him.

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Kay, ready?&#34;</font>

And right after, without waiting for his approval, she&#39;d karate chop his head - it was just lightly hitting his head, not causing any actual damage.

<font color = white>&#34;Bonk.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

He repeated his little noise dramatically as if the strike did any true damage, dissolving his will to stand.

The razors on his eyelids dig into his browline as he patters down with a divalike splash, seemingly unmoving for a while.
And... A little while more.... And more, and a bit more.... Enough mores that abit of concern should be called for...The water wasn&#39;t deep enough for him to drown, but any thalassaphobe would feel less than ideal about the blanket of liquid that engulfed them.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) bonked the boy on the head and immediately fell asleep right after. She was really tired today after being tortured and traveling to another village. But the sudden loud noise of a splash woke her up in confusion, which woke up Fubuki again. Once more she looked around and realized...Meixun must&#39;ve done a technique!

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, so you wanted to show me this r--&#34;</font>

She looked down and saw the boy on the water, simply floating. Not moving. At all.

<font color = white>&#34;MEIXUN?!&#34;</font>

Fubuki went down to grab him in a hurry, desperately trying to pull him up...she thought she had killed him. Even though she was older, the girl wasn&#39;t that strong physically. All she ended up doing was falling towards the pool of water as well, right next to Meixun.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) felt like he just watched a murder play out in slow motion. He wasn&#39;t drowning, right--?
A slant of posture permits him a view of the boy floating in the water face up. Good. 

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;ve killed him in board daylight. Merciless,&#34;</font> he told her, despite being able to tell the kid was breathing even from this distance. </font></font></font>

He looked at his ruined undershirt, realizing that he&#39;s just soaked one of his favorite clothes for a shinobi technique.... A frown pinched on his lips before he turned over to Shuye, <font color = white>&#34;Daole shenme daole shenme?&#34;</font> He chanted eagerly.

It&#39;s been a while since either of the Zhu siblings brought up their youngest sister, so whatever the eldest got must&#39;ve been very sentimental.
