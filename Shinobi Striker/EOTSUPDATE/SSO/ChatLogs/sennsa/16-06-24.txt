<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) snaps at the somber girl before she could finish her sentence and interupts.

<font color = white>&#34;Hey hey, chop chop wife, you want that allowance, you&#39;re going to have to work for it, wife. Get to making them sandwiches.&#34;</font>

He gives her a playful touch on the arm as if he thought he was being loving and romantic..</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Ill take my buns toasted, extra mayo with bacon and chopped chicken.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Tomatos, and add a little pepper.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (wtf, I jus killed a gnat by typing)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun(The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) OOCs: (WTF)
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: OOOOO!  Yes toast the sub buns!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: You heard the crowd!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: We want our buns toasted!
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Toasty buns!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) yells: Toasted Buns!!!!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Buns...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Beef Bacon in between...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) looked towards the red eyed girl and scratched his cheek.
<font color = white>&#34;Er.. I&#39;m just makin&#39; sure he ain&#39;t sleepin&#39; on the job, that&#39;s all lady.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) salivates</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) asks: What job, is that?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;Mn...&#34;</font> The boy grunts in discomfort, someone is holding back. Or, worse yet: <i>somebody knows he&#39;s searching for them.</i>

Shuye&#39;s words pierce through his concentration just before he attempted to trudge deeper.
<font color = white>&#34;Mnh? O-Oh!.&#34;</font> He acknowledges Kunigami with a bow, clasping his hands together in the process. His eyes burn into the two-tone head&#39;s face for a second, just for a second though--a rare occasion on his part.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: OOOH  IDea...  What if we do like CHEECE TOASTED STUFFED TOASTED BUNS?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) gave them a nod and left it at that.
Now then...

...what's going on over there? He's finally free to focus on the chatter. People-watching and such. He took a seat on the arena's edge, listening in on this talk of sandwiches and holy matrimony(?). </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Eh. cheese, sorry I blanked out.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: All this food talk, someone's about to owe me a meal after this if it keeps going...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) drools a litte bit at Tsuneko's ideal.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: Apologies... I had a reservation of thoughtlessless for a short time.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) waved her hand in front of the dark skinned not-quite-teen.

<font color = white>&#34;What job?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) closed her eyes, a vein buldged across her forehead -- though hidden by her bangs. Her irritation had reached its limit and although this boy didn&#39;t mean any harm she found his words to be truly demeaning. How dare he try bossing her around? That was her job.

<font color = white>&#34;You idiot!&#34;</font> she barked. With a clenched fist she sought to bonk the boy on the head. While she didn&#39;t really have any strength behind the punch, if it hit it&#39;d probably leave a lump on his head. 

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll never marry ya&#39;! Tha&#39; person I marry would know that -I&#39;m- tha&#39; prize damnit!&#34;</font> Reilin exclaimed. 
(D- Agi. Not actually trying to deal any damage so I guess E Str)</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) placed a hand on his hip and tilts his head to the side.
<font color = white>&#34;The job ta be ready whenever an enemy invades the village, woman.&#34;</font> he told her plainly.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept up her scowl, unamused.

<font color = white>&#34;He doesn&#39;t even have a headband. He has no job.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She's got a point! Sh- Er, both of the girls talking right now I guess.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) pondered if she should kick him into the moat, just to get revenge from earlier, but figured it probably wasn&#39;t a good idea.

Well, it was, because she&#39;d come up with it, but it would come with a degree of future revenge, probably.

<font color = white>&#34;Have fun with that. M&#39;gonna go.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: NO for real......Whos making those sandwhiches.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: No one is big guy. No one is...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) was completely off guard as he was continuing to take orders and was decked with a &#39;powerful punch&#39; that sent him flying.

<font color = white>&#34;--Gaaaaaaahhh!&#34;</font>

He slams on the floor while skidding slightly.

<font color = white>&#34;Hrngh..Ouch..Y-you&#39;re the prize??&#34;</font>

He grunts as he raises up to his feet, rubbing the afflicted area.

<font color = white>&#34;Okay okay..I think I get it..Ill buy you an apron before you get to making the sandwhiches...And a hair net!&#34;</font>

(Damage taken!)</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Don't worry..she's making the sandwhiches!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Hrngh..Ouch..what a punch..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) moves over and stares the Uchihue into the eyes!

<font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re a great prize, mhm mhm.&#34;</font>

Hmmm, sammiches sound good though.

The spider girl would side step away again as she stares up at the sky.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: The wonders of youth...but arent you a bit to young to be asking girls to become housewives.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) had a strong suspicion they would try to push him into the moat too. Weird that they didn't.
<b>The Fūma would remember this.</b> Perhaps he would go easy on her the next time the opportunity to throw blunt objects at faces arose. 

Either way, he continued to sit there, with a water bottle in hand. Idly taking sips. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) whispers: YeJie.... Who is that large Tuediean with the red hair and stave?
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: Too young? My paw said to find a beautiful girl and to marry her!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I don't know, Meixun.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: So I'm doing just that!
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: Eh hmm..That reminds me, I wonder if she has any pepper corn ranch...
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) asks: Hey wife! You got any pepper corn ranch for my sandwich??
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) suddenly begins to sweat a little bit. It's a very delayed response, but he can feel Shuye's looking in his general direction. His eyes wander in the opposite direction.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Mmmmm peppercorn.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) points, this time more softly.

<font color = white>&#34;Mn... Ho...u as.....des...ions....th.....tong....in?&#34;</font> He murmurs for only her to translate.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) is looking past Venturo, to the tall man with the staff-- which makes his subtle sweat and anxiety even more funny.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) smirked to herself as she watched the children bicker. The mood was certainly boiling up to something edging on exciting.

<font color = white>&#34;Do not let that slight go unansweared young lady! I will owe you ten ryo should you make him eat such words.&#34;</font> She would march closer, a fire burning in her eyes to see more vicious bonks be delivered</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) yells: Yer' paw should have relayed it a bit better. Now all the girls are just going to think you are a creep. But uh..Good luck!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) glanced over.
<font color = white>&#34;Hey. The One who fell just before the Finish Line, considered quitting, but powered through with his pride intact. What&#39;s your name?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: Six Arms, what's yer' name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) turned her head toward Meixun then, giving Venturo a moment&#39;s repireve. She spoke, but the words didn&#39;t make any sense to anyone else at first, then.

<font color = white>&#34;You introduce yourself deferentially. Then you ask what his &#39;rank&#39; is-- He&#39;s old, so he&#39;s probably a chuunin. Unless he&#39;s talented, then he&#39;s probably a jounin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: A new power..
<br><font color=green>*Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) says: Could be one of you
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) asks: Alike the Shogun's perchance?
<br><font color=green>*Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) says: Greater, maybe
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: Mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks toward the ground for a moment.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) rubs his eyes.

<br><font color=green>*Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) says: Some of us wear them to conceal our identities. After many years you make many enemies
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Ah, makes sense...
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) asks: Soo... you wear that everywhere?
<br><font color=green>*Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) says: Envoys could walk into our gates from territories I’ve been to, unless under specific circumstances I’m not allowed to take it off. Unfortunately
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (hello! I need help)

<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) asks: What are the circumstances?
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) asks: Like do you need to wear it while you shower?
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (I will wait until I have cores....I think....)
<br><font color=green>*Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) says: I must be inside and out-of-view of plain sight, so I can take it off in private residences and meetings
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (I forgot to add your name. Derp.)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) had made her way back after the cow incident to see the normal crowd had shrunk in size. 

<font color = white>&#34;Enjoying the childrens questions?&#34;</font> she said smiling and going to take a seat at the waters edge. <font color = white>&#34;All is well I hope? I wouldnt want to slack off if there is work to be done.&#34;</font> 

She asked this to noone in particular, even so she had already produced some reading. She was fully expecting it was a common day and no need to trouble herself with much</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) asks: Okay so how many people have seen your face?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) looks over to Papiyas with a nod. <font color = white>&#34;They’re certainly not questions I would’ve expected, but harmless nonetheless&#34;</font> With how relaxed he was, it seemed as if all were calm for now

(Masaki btw) He looks over to the dark-skinned teen with a tilt of his head. <font color = white>&#34;Not many now, I suppose. I’m often alone when I’m in my residence&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Niwa, Papiyas(The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (ty)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) flipped a page in her book, seeming to become mostly dead to the world with afew glances about rarely to make sure nothing was afoot.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) strokes his chin.
<font color = white>&#34;Okay okay okay... So like what even inspired you to say &#39;Imma hide my face away&#39;? Did someone push you over the edge, did they betray ya? Or something like that anyways?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) looks back over to the dark-skinned teen, <font color = white>&#34;I was ordered to after a mission resulted in killing a shinobi from a neighboring village&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) says: From there, the death toll I was ordered to take rose. Until it no longer became safe for my identity to be plain view
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) squints his eyes trying to peer into the eyeholes of the mask, trying his hardest to get a glance of the assumed man.
<font color = white>&#34;So you&#39;re saying their is a chance, that I do a mission so good that the Shogun is going to call me up and tell me that I should wear a mask?&#34;</font> he questioned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) shakes his head

<font color = white>&#34;No. But there is a chance down the line for you to sign away the life you have for more lethal orders. Just be ready to leave the rest behind&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) says: Sounds pretty cool to me, masky.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) glances back to the aloof one, <font color = white>&#34;what was your name?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) glanced up from her absent minded reading. She rose her wrist up to wipe at her eye. Now what was that tall women up to?

<font color = white>&#34;someone is busy it seems. A peer of yours Masaki?&#34;</font> she said before turning a page and starting to read once more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) nods his head, <font color = white>&#34;that’s right. Doing good work, too. How’s your reading coming along?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) asks: Slow....but I do think I will be focusing on the blade. Yet that sounds dull in a certain light does it not? What if I had more than one?
<br><font color=green>*Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) says: Wouldn’t hurt to learn to use a few
<br><font color=green>*Niwa, Papiyas (The well dressed red-head-HattoriHanzu) says: If only I had extra arms myself...imagine....
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Shinobi Guard (The commanding man-ChainsOfMadness) leans back with the thought in his mind.

<font color = white>&#34;You could always have a surgeon attach some extra arms, or ask a Tsuchigomo for tips&#34;</font> he jokes, with a small laugh after</font></font></font>

legs crossed of course...and began to slowly write something down after turning the page. She was still making her division notice...probably wont be finished till later she hoped!
