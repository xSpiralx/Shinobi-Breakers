The boy picked up on a few key details, noticing how the woman often spoke about improvements and benefits for the village. It became cleaer that she was a local leader.
Satisfied with the information he had gathered, Daigen leaned back against a railing and took a deep breath while analyzing and channeling the information he had received.
