Once there, he takes a second to wave to Chobina and call out,

<font color = white>&#34;Yeah! Nice to meet you Chobina! I&#39;m Utsuwa Hideo!&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s very tempting ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she said, looking toward Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;But she&#39;s right. The last ante we had.. well you didn&#39;t quite honour that. You did show me some cash before but yer&#39; track record doesn&#39;t really uh.. inspire confidence. This is a -big- bet, ya&#39; know.&#34;</font> she stated.</font></font></font>

Seemed like business as usual to him, though he was unaware of something might be going on. He waves to the group and stands idly by. Just in case there was a gathering for a reason</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) simply unveiled three-hundred ryo, counting each individual bill arduously in front of the young Uchiha.
Well--actually, on top of her head. <font color = white>&#34;I would expect you of anyone to understand the weight this... <i>demurral</i> entails.&#34;</font> One hundred Ryo.

The Zhu slowed down his count, moving further and further into a more visceral tone when he spoke, <font color = white>&#34;There is value within these mere paper marks. Indeed, such an amount--I believe your tongue for it would represent... Divinity? Roughly of course, though I would be astonished for you to recognize such a phrase.&#34;</font> One-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;Merely, in a triviality--it would represent a net gain for you, would it not?&#34;</font> Two-Hundred.
<font color = white>&#34;Just a simple game that you have succeeded in many a process.&#34;</font> Two-Twenty-Five. <font color = white>&#34;<i>What is to prevent you from....</i>&#34;</font> Two-Fifty.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Complete and utter dominion?</b>&#34;</font>Two-Seventy-Five.

With twenty-five ryo in hand, the boy places it a the Uchiha girl&#39;s nose.
<font color = white>&#34;Defeat me. That provides one-thousand Ryo. And any form of assistance you would comprise.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) was astonished and completely taken aback for a moment. Was this boy, no this insect really counting his money on her head?! Of all places. This was nothing but utter disrespect. Who could assume it was otherwise. She grasped at the money, balling it tightly in a fist before thrusting it back into his chest with a bit of force. The Uchiha returned it. Her anger was prevalent and she hadn&#39;t even bothered to hide it.

She&#39;d continue to press into his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.....&#34;</font> she tried her best to contain her anger which resulted from the blatant condescension he&#39;d just exhibited. <font color = white>&#34;I ain&#39;t just a gambler. Maybe I didn&#39;t represent myself well enough. I&#39;m bein&#39; nice right now. So be happy. Happy I ain&#39;t Kickin&#39;. Yer&#39;. Ass and takin&#39; yer money after using my head as a table for your money.&#34;</font> her finger jabbed into the boy&#39;s chest with a few of the words she&#39;d uttered. 

<font color = white>&#34;You might just be the dumbest smart person I&#39;ve ever met.&#34;</font> she scoffed. <font color = white>&#34;Now then. I&#39;ll gamble with ya&#39;. And when I beat ya&#39; and if you can&#39;t pay up. Well, I&#39;m gettin&#39; my money from you.. from Fubuki. From whoever there is. But don&#39;t forget who yer&#39; dealin&#39; with, alright?&#34;</font> 

She&#39;d calmed herself down by now and withdrew her hand from his chest. <font color = white>&#34;Let&#39;s have some fun. I wanna take my mind offa&#39; that ugly execution anyhow.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Don't bet, Reilin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) beckons the beige-haired youth over and gestures across the road.

<font color = white>&#34;The blueberry is a gambling addict. He&#39;s trying to sell himself, and money he doesn&#39;t have, to keep gambling and try to the girl in front of him.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Uchiha, Kenzo (The frail black-eyed boy-Jessinator) rubs the back of his head watching his kin blow up. He wasn’t entirely sure what was going on beyond the gambling. However. Using his cousins head for a table wasn’t cool.

He clenches fist and shakes a little, but Reilin had herself handled. Even within their own village it seemed there might be people to look about. That was kind of a worrisome sentiment.

But...surely the all of aspirant meant no disrespect? But he didn’t say so either. The boy, for his first time, was truly conflicted on whether to get angry or keep calm</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <font color = white>&#34;I refuse, Raku. Unfortunately, this is no mere sport.&#34;</font> Not anymore, at least.

The boy unveils the set of cards, Human, Animal, Plant. He reveals the full amount to the Uchiha girl, prior to connecting the stack back together--handing it over to Tsuneko.

<font color = white>&#34;As per usual, Tsuneko roles as the mediator--a non partisan. Should she rein the victory? The bout is nulled, Should she be victorious alongside one of us? The victor is the challenger.&#34;</font> Sure, a simple set of rulings, nothing&#39;s quite changed.

<font color = white>&#34;... <b><i>Xieji</b></i>. Eleven bouts.&#34;</font> A sudden deathmatch, winner takes all.

Who will reign supreme? Meixun&#39;s pride against Reilin&#39;s own? Meixun&#39;s devilish temperament against Reilin&#39;s fury-driven luck?

It is a challenge of.... Well it&#39;s probably not <i>that</i> important, they are just kids settling their petty differences.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I s&#39;pose it&#39;s fair to lower if we&#39;re even then.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

All that stalling just for--

<font color = white>&#34;S-Sixth.... Bout...&#34;</font> The sixth bout? Didn&#39;t he choose animal? An--

<i>She won the sixth bout</i>.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: What did I disrupt?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled a shit-eating grin. Looking directly toward Meixun. She relished in her victory, soaking in his expression right now as the realization had dawned on him. He&#39;d lost. He&#39;d lost without even knowing it. Admittedly she too was a bit air-headed and hadn&#39;t even realized she won. But to lose whilst unaware was an entirely different thing.

She decided to draw a final card but did not flip it up this time around. She merely placed it down face down and ended her turn.

<font color = white>&#34;Good game.&#34;</font> as he hand pulled off of the card she turned it at the wrist, palm outstretched. <font color = white>&#34;You owe me a lot of money.&#34;</font> she said, still grinning and awaiting her deposit.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Good luck getting it, Reilin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) Five-Hundred Ryo. Down the drain.

For what, exactly? He didn't really <i>want</i> the money. Only the victory, but he couldn't even afford that much. His brain was circling indefinitely: the character for six, dancing about his head, collapsing on his thoughts with a paperweight keeping a stack from falling--though the stack is stacked too high, the paperweight only uses the stack as a diving boad and knocks it over. Translating every piece of paper with one singular character.

<b><i>6</b></i>

Two-Hundred Ryo, a crumpled mess--caused wholeheartedly by himself, returned back to its rightful wielder.

And....And now....

And now.... The remaining three-hundred.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) smiled softly as a sum of money was placed in her palm. She uncrinkled the mess of it and instead of feeling happiness, she was confused. Her head fell to a tilt. <font color = white>&#34;I must be losing my vision.. Or I can&#39;t count properly.&#34;</font> she said. She lifted the money to hold it up to the sun but with all the sand, dirt and debris flying about it was hard to see fully. Nevertheless it was painfully obvious; this was not 500 ryo.

<font color = white>&#34;Is this going to transform into 500 in a moment?&#34;</font> she asked, lowering the money now.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: T-T-T-Tha....Is T-wo...

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: This is even less than you counted on my head.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) asks: Why are you holding out on me?
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Told ya, good luck collecting your winnings.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: He'll pay.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) wore the slightest condolence in his eyes, for the dark side of gambling throwing someone into the red so rapidly and mercilessly. He gave slow shakes of head to the scene.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It really is- Oh, I didn't even see you Katora. Hey.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Good evening, Hideo. I'm surprised you didn't join them.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Got tired of losing ryo?

Actually

<b>BANG</b>

The boy knocked himself in the head, sticking out his tongue, Gon style.

<font color = white>&#34;Sorry. Forgot one thing. I&#39;ve never won a single time I&#39;ve partook in such a challenge.&#34;</font>

He unveiled the final remains of the Ryo, smacking Reilin on the head playfully.
<font color = white>&#34;I would&#39;ve suspected a bloodhound such as yoruself to be able to recognize the stench of a proper sum... Ah well, suppose not.&#34;</font>
He still has the audacity to goad? Well, of course he does.
<i>He lost, he doesn&#39;t have anything left to lose anyhow.</i></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Hehehe.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) side eyes Reilin.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Suppose that settle's that, then.
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) asks: Did he ever pay the remainder from the previous bet?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: Youuuuuuu.....
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Meeeeeeeeee....
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Feels like I'm watching a crime.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: Financial Murder. In broad daylight. 
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: I believe the term is.... Extortion..
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Its a crime he commit against himself, really.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s glee quickly returned to her. She added the remaining 300 to her stack of cash and thumbed through it to validate that it was all there. Once it was, the Uchiha tucked it away neatly in her kimono for safe keeping.

Though her smile had not faded just yet, she looked at him expectantly and without saying anything. Wide-eyed and staring. She heard his most recent words and this was her reaction. An unwavering stare, eyebrows risen in arches.

Finally breaking her silence. <font color = white>&#34;As I clarified before we began -and- you agreed. I get the 500 -and- you become my subordinate.. Did ya&#39; foerget?&#34;</font> she asked. <font color = white>&#34;I believe -your- response was... &#39;Should you retain the victory.&#39;..&#34;</font> her fingertips found themselves instinctively creating a finger-pryamid. Villainy.

<font color = white>&#34;Did ya&#39; forget? Huh? Did ya&#39;, did ya&#39;?&#34;</font> her brows rose even more, if that were possible. <font color = white>&#34;I guess -I- forgot about the initial 30 you still owed.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: True enough. It's why I stay away from high-stakes gambles.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) says: A-Ah.. Subor...
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uchiha, Reilin(The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) OOCs: (who took a bigger L. The prisoner or Meixun? find out next time on Shinobi Breaker Z)

He makes a mad dash for it, a maddeningly mad dash for it. So mad of a dash that the dust storm seemed to hold a horizontal vortex where Meixun once stood.

<font color = white>&#34;<b><i>Tomorrow! I promise you&#39;ll be allowed to... Aah! We shall discuss it further tomorrow!!!</b></i>&#34;</font> He screamed into the storm while fleeing.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) slicked his hair back, to uncover his ear. Almost believing that he&#39;s misheard them just now.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: He wagered being a slave or something.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) hadn&#39;t expected this turn of events to unfold. Meixun made a run for it! And a fast one too. Much too fast for her to keep up with even if she wanted. Though she didn&#39;t mind, he&#39;d have to come around sooner or later. 

<font color = white>&#34;Right. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be seein&#39; ya&#39;, Henchmen #1.&#34;</font> she called out as he disappeared out into the storm.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m gettin&#39; pretty tired though. All this winning at life as got me feeling exhausted!&#34;</font> she yawned.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Welp, I&#39;m gettin&#39; in tha&#39; water.&#34;</font> the teen said. She decided to change inside, though. Folding her kimono and putting it away before returning in a towel.

The girl took a dip into the water, swimming around freely.

<font color = white>&#34;So who else is lookin&#39; forward to becomin&#39; a Genin?&#34;</font> she inquired.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) used her free hand to move one of her raven locks behind her ear before commenting.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#f25da8>Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) laid against the back as she avoided getting into the water, she felt too old compared to anyone else to do it.

<font color = white>&#34;I wanna a lot. That&#39;s like, one of my goals One of my uhh...five goals. Damn I have too many goals..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: one day..il become a genin..

<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) says: Becoming a Jonin.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But first you gotta be a Chunnin.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would lightly take off her boots..and long socks..as she rested them besides herself. She found herself sitting down and crossing her legs enjoying the waters warmth.

Reaching into her kimono, she slowly took out a clipboard..as she listened to the genin talk. Filling out more information about the lore of herbs.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) drops his gaze in thought for a moment. <font color = white>&#34;....&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up to the Uchiha, monotone ever-present as he spoke.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: I think we are both smarter.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) says: Just studious.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) couldn&#39;t help but snicker at his remark.

<font color = white>&#34;Well that&#39;s one thing ya&#39; got in common. Can&#39;t fight ya&#39; on that.&#34;</font> she continued swimming about. <font color = white>&#34;But your personalities too. Both of ya&#39; talk in that same dull tone. Not much fer&#39; words and got an answer for anythin&#39;!&#34;</font> she said which was followed by more laughter.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) began to think once again, a dull matte finish overtaking his once glossy pupils.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) looks back up again.
  <font color = white>&#34;You&#39;re right.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) flipped another page. <font color = white>&#34;And you talk a lot for someone who has nothing to say.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) thought about filling her mouth with water to spit out but when she realized this was a very public body of water she decided against it. Instead she wished she was in a river or ocean or something that flowed.

After hearing Ume speak she turned her gaze towards her. <font color = white>&#34;Heh, I got lots ta&#39; say. Ain&#39;t you been listenin&#39;? Juss&#39; from this conversation I met you an&#39; Bookworm #2. Learned about yer&#39; personalities and...&#34;</font> she paused, swimming a bit closer to the edge.

<font color = white>&#34;I decided. I like Raku more. He&#39;s a know-it-all but he&#39;s not as stuck-up.&#34;</font> she said with a wide grin. She knew Ume wouldn&#39;t care anyhow.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b55858>Uchiha, Ume (The onyx-haired girl-Mystifii) nodded, and turned her page. Reilin&#39;s assumption would be correct - Ume could not care less. <font color = white>&#34;If you think I&#39;m stuck up for defending myself, that&#39;s fine.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigumo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: Oh really?  Fubuki, he was trying to bet with all the money you got.  Which would mean if he continues, no sword.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I have enough money for one sword now, surely I can get enough for a second one in time.
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The devious-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Eh.. He did mention somethin' about you havin' money.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) The boy grew tired of constant practice after being forcefully relocated out of the caves at the village officials&#39; request. A newfound sense of distance formed between the hot springs, a place often overlooked but particularly busy today. It didn&#39;t matter to the quiet, frail boy.

He removed silky fabrics before walking out to the male area with a towel and shorts on. The reticent young boy slipped into the water, placing a palm onto the sand used for decoration. He would start practicing imbuing it with his Chakra.

After accomplishing that, he would shift it around without weaving a single seal.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Why would a super handsome mountain-throwing hero like me only be able to teach the academy?
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: It's a respectable job. Isn't your accomplished Dad doing exactly that?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Yeah, doesn't mean I wanna do it too.

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And that's what matters.
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Is praise all you care about?
