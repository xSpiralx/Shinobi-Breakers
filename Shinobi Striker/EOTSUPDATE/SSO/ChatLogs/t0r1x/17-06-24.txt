Her hands came together, a loud clap echoing out, before she withdraws her hands apart towards either side of her. As her hands stretched out, shimmering pink crystals formed, making unique patterns along the way until she&#39;d finally reached as far as she could.

Clearly not having forgotten how quick she was to pawn the work of repairing the gate and stairs off on literally anyone else. His eyes narrow, staring at her for a moment. However he&#39;s immediately distracted by the crystals. His brain was smooth and the rocks were pretty.

<font color = white>&#34;A shiny object of my choice?! Out of crystal right? That&#39;d be awesome...&#34;</font>

He cups his chin in his hand and begins pondering what to ask for. Eventually snapping his fingers and holding out fifty ryo to the Shingen.

<font color = white>&#34;I want a crystal monkey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: Hideo, you want money yet you spend it on this?
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Just... make him a mirror...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: What's the point of having money if I don't spend it- Shuye are you suggesting I'm a monkey?!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: But you're always complaining about money, maybe save a little first...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) scowled externally, and smiled internally. Silence and eye contact is the answer.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I'm not *complaining* about money! I just *want* money. There's a difference!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: Hm. I guess then, fair enough.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: And I want money so that I can spend it! Spending money makes me feel better.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8d8b70>Mugen, Raku (The aloof aspirant-Sushimon) continued flipping through his book.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) asks: What do you want to spend it on though? Just anything?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I mean, anything that's cool yeah.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Liiiike a crystal monkey!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Should have got a rock-candy monkey.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: I don't think she can make rock-candy... But that does sound awesome!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) gave a nod in response before clasping her hands together once again. All the crystals she&#39;d formed turned into nothing but sparkles in the air as her hands met.
 <font color = white>&#34;Of course!&#34;</font>, she exclaimed once again, the prospect of profit clearly warranting more energy out of the normally aloof girl.

As her hands began pulling apart, a Curious George-esque monkey formed within her palms, shimmering against the sunlight. Little by little it came together, its slightly larger than body head forming first, followed by its body and limbs, until finally she added a little curved tail at the end.

Extending her hand out, she offered the piece to the boy.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now, my crystals are resistant to near everything in such compact form, so breaking it should be hard!... UnlessIdiebutthenwe&#39;reallscrewed.&#34;</font>, she finished with a bright smile.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) &#39;s eyes light up as Kitsumi begins. Watching with awe as the little paperweight takes shape. Mumbling to no one in particular as she works,

<font color = white>&#34;Maaan manipulating crystals is so cool...&#34;</font>

Taking the monkey, he holds it up toward the sun. Turning it around in the air and simply looking at the sparkles.

<font color = white>&#34;This is awesome!&#34;</font>

Then his ears perk up at the claim of it being extremely durable. A clear mental battle is fought as he resists the urge to drop it or rap a knuckle against it to test her claim. For a moment he wonder if she was actualyl lying and the complete opposite was true-

What if this thing was super fragile!

He carefully lowers it, now holding it in both hands. He nods to Kitsumi and says,

<font color = white>&#34;This is super cool. Thank you Kitsumi. Worth fifty ryo...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Of course! I'm available from nine-to-five on weekdays.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: I-Isn't that just your normal shinobi hours?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Yep!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) taps the side of her head a few times.
 <font color = white>&#34;Smarter not harder.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) watched the display from the front row. Honestly, she was expecting it to be a total scam. It wasn't. The jounin was a surprisingly talented sculptor, and Hideo seemed very pleased by the item he received, too. If it was true that it wouldn't break...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) shook his head.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat! Nooooooooo...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) leans forward towards the boy, gripping his shirt.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=teal>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) releases the boy and smiles.
 <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m always busy!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=teal>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Y-Yeah super busy! The busiest!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: . . . . .
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#800080>Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) would look towards his left to see a man with the massive burn scar on the right side of his body, it looked extremely painful and all he could think about was how narley it was.

<font color = white>&#34;I wonder how he could of gotten something like that...&#34;</font> he whispered to himself as he was looking.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Anyways! Anyone else want a crystal of their choice?! Only fifty-ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: No thanks, I'm saving money for a sword.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Are you selling crystals to the kids.
<br><font color=green>*Kuro (The boy with his eye covered-LordYuma) asks: uhh what can you make?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Himeki! Do you want a crystal thingy from Kitsumi? I'll pay for it!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Maybe! And I can make mostly anything! The larger it is, the less durable it is, though!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Im pretty sure you dont need the money Kitsumi, boy Its Sensei Kitsumi to you. It's like you dont have any good upbringing.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Whaaaaaaaaaaaat... I totally need the Ryo!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: She hasn't even taught me anything though! Tch, not my sensei...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Feel free to hit him over the head, Kitsumi.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Well.. If you're learning Doton or Shurikenjutsu, I'm your girl! If it's anything else, I'm clueless!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Dad no!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) reaches out and bonks the child over the head.

No missed opportunities to bully children.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) says: ...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately drops down. Squatting and moving to hold a hand against the spot he&#39;d been hit. Sucking air through his teeth as he mumbles,

<font color = white>&#34;Ahhhtatatata...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: This is a fight you cannot win.
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) asks: Another dent in his skull. Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: N-Not another one...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Lucky it was Kitsumi who hit you and not me.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: I am rather noodle-army!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I bet you hit like an old man these days...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Silently positioned by a tree, observing others present with a tired demeanor, the reticent young boy made use of a small mirror to peer into the deepening bags under his eyes.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) asks: Old man?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: T-That wasn't supposed to be outloud...
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Just throw yourself in the moat.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: It won't save me...
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: He's dead.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: I wonder if I could crystalize the whole moat with you guys in it...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead its much better than the lump thats about to form on your head.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Jump in the moat for me right quick...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) asks: Can I take off my clothes first?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Soggy socks are the worst...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uh... That's up to your dad not me. You might catch a cold, or something I'dunno.
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: . . . .
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: I'll hold the monkey for you.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Thank you Shuye.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) looked like a wreck, with the sun looming over Iwagakure, blinding the child. It's easy to assume that the child doesn't get out much. Blinking twice in a slow manner, the pocket mirror is placed away into a pouch as the 5'3 child continues to watch the proceedings of those present.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) flickered towards his son, kicking up a gentle waft of dust, before kicking him into the water with a sideways kick.

<font color = white>&#34;Just get in the water you bastard&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) was in the process of holding out the crystalline monkey to Shuye as he&#39;s kicked in the chest. A pathetic grunt is shouted out as he is sent straight into the water.

<font color = white>&#34;Guh!&#34;</font>

Unfortunately he was a big kid and his clothes were now soaked. So rather than simply swim back to edge like a normal person; he flailed around helplessly for a few seconds. Splashing water everywhere and toward all those nearby. Before eventually realizing the moat wasn&#39;t very deep.

And remembering that he could walk on water. With a sigh he plants his hands on the surface of the water and pulls himself up and out. Shaking in place like a dog, trying to get rid of at least some of the water. Which, was almost entirely futile.

Grumbling to himself he returns to his spot and glares at his father.

<font color = white>&#34;You didn&#39;t have to call me a bastard too!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) asks: Hey, Mugen. On a scale of one-to-ten, how cool do you think a crystal statue of him would be?
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Is there a Negative? option.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I can't believe you'd say that about your eldest son...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Your only son!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Whats tewelve more years, make another one. Start again.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Y-You wouldn't...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: We can seal him away, Mugen.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Just say the word...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Please don't...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Go ahead.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: -
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) The boy was gone before she could blink. Before the wind hit the back of her kimono from the man's movement. He was in the water before the surface tension broke and bubbled. But still, Shuye had her hands out, and managed to catch the monkey before it fell to the ground. Would it have shattered? Probably not. But they didn't need to know.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) smiles brightly as she holds up a single seal. In that very moment, the ground beneath Hideo would begin to crystalize, slowly crawling up his legs.

Well, slowly to her. To him? It was a near instant encapsulation!

As it finally reached up to his neck, she stopped the crystals and turned to Mugen.
 <font color = white>&#34;Tada!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9933>Hanaka, Ashimiya (The teenager-Dbz563187) sips the moat water.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) looks down at the crystals growing beneath him. Quickly looking toward Kitsumi he shout,

<font color = white>&#34;No! Release me! I command y-&#34;</font>

Before being cut off and entombed in a gemstone prison. His smooth brain now perfectly immoratlized in crystaline form.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc9900>Kamei, Hitoshi (The reticent young boy-Amlynn24) Blankly staring at the iron vessel and the pale-skinned girl, the child only had the energy to blink in a lazy manner, with cruelty on full display. Getting involved might result in their scandalous activities being directed towards him after all.

As crystals crept up Hideo's frame, the reticent young boy confirmed their insanity, taking solace in the natural concealment offered by the bark of the rather large tree.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Contractor Kreig (The lumberjack, jack-Kristuria) begins to tirelessly swing a large axe at the tree before him. He didn't have a permit and this was illegal.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff0000>Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) taps the frozen statue of his son, with a finger tentatively, considering how long he should leave him like that.

<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) says: Uhm...
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: Probably not!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#aa326e>Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) retracts the crystals just enough to free his nose.
 <font color = white>&#34;Now he can!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Mugen (The iron vessel-Zombietron80) says: Ah good.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#96003c>Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) immediately inhales sharply. His nostrils flaring as he breathes. And, while he couldn't move his jaw, he could shit spew a stream of expletives. Granted the sound comes out of his nose as a garbled grunt that was completely incomprehensible. But it made him feel better.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Kitsumi (The pale-skinned girl-Acid Gumdrop) yells: I think he likes it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: AHOUKINGAOLESEEIEOU!

With a quiet sigh, he barks to the reticent young boy. <font color = white>&#34;Come on, we didn’t travel all the way from Akhibara just for you to shy away. Meet your peers, make some friends, you’re back home now.&#34;</font>

He approaches the boy hiding behind the tree, mostly obscured. The man had very excellent hearing though, and could tell just who was behind there. <font color = white>&#34;Don’t be afraid of them&#34;</font> he says aloud whilst thinking &#39;they should probably be afraid of you&#39;

He motions forward, <font color = white>&#34;come on, Hitoshi. You’ll need to make friends so we can get you a proper squad after graduation&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fubuki (The light-purple haired girl-Gohnita) says: I didn't expect that from you.
