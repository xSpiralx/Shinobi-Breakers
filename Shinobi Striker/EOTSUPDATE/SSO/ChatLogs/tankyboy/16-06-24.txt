<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s relentless stride towards Higane slows as her words cut through the air, piercing his focus like a well-aimed blade. Her snicker and taunt reach him clearly, igniting a flicker of irritation in his eyes that he struggles to conceal behind a mask of stoicism.

He hears her accusations about his demeanor, about not understanding what it means to be revered, to carry the weight of expectations. For a moment, Sogeki&#39;s gaze intensifies with a silent challenge, his jaw tensing imperceptibly.

<font color = white>&#34;You think I don&#39;t know pressure?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice is low, carrying a hint of raw intensity. <font color = white>&#34;Being at the top means everyone&#39;s watching, waiting for you to slip. It&#39;s a different kind of pressure, one that fuels me.&#34;</font>

His demeanor shifts subtly, a smirk playing at the corner of his lips. <font color = white>&#34;But that&#39;s why I&#39;m here, isn&#39;t it? To show them all who stands at the pinnacle.&#34;</font> His tone is nonchalant yet laced with confidence, his eyes locking onto Higane&#39;s with a calculated glare.

Despite her faltering stance, Sogeki remains cautious, sensing an opportunity amidst her wavering resolve. His own pride and determination drive him forward, pushing him to capitalize on the moment and assert his dominance once more.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: What...even is this about I wonder?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Whats with everyone trying to sound so...tough
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: Main character syndrome.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s had said too much. To think that none of this would have happened if she didnt hear fellow nearby colleague speak of how mighty the Hyuuga believe themselves to be.

Like a fortress crumbling under the weight of a dragons paw, Higane drops her stance and backs off, raising a heavy hand high above her head. <font color = white>&#34;I surrender.&#34;</font> She laments.

The spiral of ying and yang emotions bubbling inside her could not be quelled, at least not now and not here. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;l change the stigma. Mark my words.&#34;</font>

These are the last things the young girl says as she backs off taking a seat on a nearby colum.. She flips her pouch around..

Now fully visible was the Cadeuces Staff and the Red Cross, labeled across her pouch. She remained there idle and fumbling through her supplies ignoring any attempts at discussion.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki&#39;s intense gaze follows every movement of Higane&#39;s retreat, his expression a mix of frustration and disappointment. He had been ready for a clash of wills, eager to prove his dominance in combat, but now that opportunity slipped away with her surrender.

<font color = white>&#34;What? You&#39;re giving up just like that?&#34;</font> Sogeki&#39;s voice carries a hint of irritation, his brow furrowing deeply. His hands clench into fists at his sides as he steps closer, his posture tense with pent-up energy.

<font color = white>&#34;You had me on the ropes, and now you&#39;re backing down?&#34;</font> His words are sharp, laced with a mixture of scolding and begrudging respect. <font color = white>&#34;You talk a big game, but you fold when things get tough. How do you expect to change any stigma like that?&#34;</font>

Despite his frustration, Sogeki&#39;s features contort into a slightly exaggerated scowl, emphasizing his displeasure at the anticlimactic end to their confrontation. His pride demanded a real challenge, not a forfeit, and he couldn&#39;t hide his disappointment at the missed opportunity for a true test of his abilities.

<font color = white>&#34;Next time, don&#39;t surrender so easily,&#34;</font> he mutters under his breath, turning away with a dismissive wave of his hand. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be ready.&#34;</font> With that, he stalks off, his demeanor a mix of simmering anger and determination to find a more satisfying challenge elsewhere.</font></font></font>

No word, no matter how sharp seemed to reach her. Yet the various comments did not fall on deaf ears.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Hm?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I could use some ryo for weapons.

<font color = white>&#34;Yo, good see family on the rise, your Jyuuken is heat no lie.&#34;</font> he horribly rapped to his fellow clansmen.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hmph!How dare you disrespect me!&#34;</font>she said as she opened up her purse to only see her beauty products and a single ryo.A single sweat droplet would flow down her face as she remembered she gambled and spent all of her money on her new heels.

<font color = white>&#34;It was worth it too.&#34;</font>she thought to herself as she admired her shoes.


<font color = white>&#34;Psh!I&#39;ll just have to ask my old man when I see him again.&#34;</font>she would tuck her hair behind her ear as she knew the kage stopped funding her due to the over spending hence why she decided to become a shinobi.

If anyone was listening they would be able to hear her purse gasping for air due to the lack of money she has.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;Hey now..its alright to not be rich.Im not from noble clan,so my survival consists on what i do.Whoever...&#34;</font>His face will go serious,like he was dead serious on what was about to say next

<font color = white>&#34;Try to make money by yourself,your father won&#39;t support you forever,remember that.So you might have alot of ryo now...but if just spend and spend without thinking of how to invest and increase it...sooner or later you might become a regular person just like all of us miss.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: Sheesh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You never struggled...thats our difference.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: You're right hence why I said we're not the same.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You need to struggle...otherwise you would never learn.
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) says: I am.
<br><font color=green>*Higen (The starry-eye'd lad-Flankyboy) says: Struggling isn't needed, you know.. She should feel lucky.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Yeah yeah..
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: You kind of struggled in our spar Najiro..maybe you can show her how to properly struggle.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#edd2b7>Senju, Rose (The girl with enchanted aura-Demon_Kitty101) would tightly grasp the boy&#39;s shirt

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ve been cut off!The old man cut me off!Now who&#39;s going to buy me my stuff!I have to work!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Heh....and thats bad?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) smirks. <font color = white>&#34;You going to give up again Najiro?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look her directly at their eyes

<font color = white>&#34;You think thats bad? Having no monetary support by your father so you can get anything and everything? Tsk,tsk..Perhaps for you is bad,afterall you are spoiled since birth.

But let me say it again,what you experience at this moment...is what everyone NORMAL experience.You want your stuff? earn it.Do you think your old man got the money out of nowhere? That they didn&#39;t struggled? Or your ancestor didn&#39;t struggle? Cause let me tell you something..Without your father,and your ancestors trying their best...you would had been just like us,another small family member of a family which isn&#39;t noble,Neither anyone cares to know their name all around their town.&#34;</font>They will pause afterwhich will continue

<font color = white>&#34;So prove yourself as senju and earn what you belive is your right to have.The other option it to beg your old man untill he dies.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (call me victor blame cause im spitting the truth)

<font color = white>&#34;Okay for one you need to like swallow your spit when you&#39;re up close like this.First of all I do work hard to get what I want,I have to put semi effort when buying my clothes and getting my deals.Second you people are my people hence why I care about how you people smell and look or even eat&#34;</font>

The senju would take a step back before dusting herself off with her lint brush.It appeared her silk dress had caught some lint from being to close to the black haired boy.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: -sigh- we will see.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) tilted her head towards the scientist. She also noticed the plathora of headbands that lined the walkways behind him. Something was seriously off about this individual. The way he spoke...his movements and his overall vibe. 

<font color = white>&#34;Uhm...yeah I am.&#34;</font> the girl lied, hoping that giving off the illusion of her being more competent than a simple academy student might thwart off the threat of an attack.

<font color = white>&#34;You shouldn&#39;t be here.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) arrives at the scene and immediately drops down to the water below. His eyes change shape, the veins in his eyes becoming more pronounced. Even as he remained out of sight, he kept the scene above him in examination.

This was the perfect chance to get information on the enemy and the strenght of the new students, he seemed prepared to dash through the bridge itself with his pure muscular body at any opportunity.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) arrives to the area. He stayed behind and simply observed. It had to be serious to warrant backup.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) seemed to be <b><i>very different</b></i> upon close examination. Organs in the wrong places, a chakra system that would make no sense and bursted with activity. Reserves massive in size, with a strange aura that couldn’t be placed correctly with what knowledge lay in hand.

<font color = white>&#34;I repesent the Dakuteika, before me are some...items we <i>procured</i>. And also a warning.

Well....I hate to see the living become something....else&#34;</font>

He seemed to be unarmed, but begins moving forward to the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;I wonder how many of you can stay locked up in here, though.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to be put off by the figure's strange innards and is immediate in his change of tactics. He sneaks around from underneath, trying to jump out from behind him to pincer the man.

He stops just before jumping out as other people react.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) lets her instincts take over and hops back a few meters, growning the distance between her and the alleged intruder once again.

What could she do? The higher ups were present, she had no weapons..

Instead she just focused her self on what she could do.. Scrutinizing the indivudal from top to bottom, her eagle eyes keenly locking onto any unsual properties or hidden gimicks.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) Would look and begin to read the indivitual&#39;s lips,he was not chakra sensitive so he cannot feel any disturbance,but it was clear this guy was not good news.

<font color = white>&#34;Young bodies...but for what.&#34;</font>He will ask,while somewhat trying to think why they needed their bodies,a bodies of some beginer genins</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) &#39;s face twisted in disgust as he examined the strange scientist&#39;s figure and heard his words. &#39;The fuck?&#39; he thought. As his eyes scanned the blonde girl, he got a very uneasy feeling. He decided to take a defensive stance, just in case.

<font color = white>&#34;What the hell?&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066ff>Aikawa, Shion (The dedicated jonin-Limb) moving to get in front of the rest he would use himself as a shield to deflect any attacks coming.

<font color = white>&#34;Get back everyone.&#34;</font>

Seeing His partner go on the offensive he would do the same. Watching to make sure the students did not do anything risky he would prepare to use a jutus on the enemy if he moved to attack the students.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryu (The reserved boy-Kryu) asks: What the heck is this?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) 's eyes narrowed as he took in the scene before him. The strange scientist with his unsettling presence and the scattered headbands spoke of a dangerous situation. His mind raced, assessing the potential threat and calculating his next move. Despite the scientist's eerie demeanor and the implied threat, Sogeki's stance remained firm and his expression unreadable, masking any fear or concern beneath a veneer of cold resolve.

He knew that action would be required, but for now, Sogeki chose to observe, gathering crucial information and waiting for the right moment to strike. His hand subtly moved towards a concealed weapon, prepared for any sudden developments. In the face of uncertainty and danger, Sogeki's instincts honed in, ready to protect himself and his comrades from whatever this mysterious threat might bring.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) stared at the scientist blankly for several moments, the unnerving intensity in his eyes making her deeply uncomfortable. There was a disturbing aura about him, a level of psychosis that was palpable and chilling.



     As a nervous tick, she ran her fingers through her golden locks while her gaze never wavered  as she regarded the bizarre individual who had just issued a dire warning.



<font color = white>&#34;So, let me get this straight,&#34;</font> she began, her tone laced with sarcasm and a hint of defiance. <font color = white>&#34;If we venture into the wilderness, you&#39;re planning to abduct us and transform us into some sort of grotesque and depraved creature such as yourself? Is that what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</font>

She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper,  ashs he  mockingly stated. <font color = white>&#34;Because if that&#39;s your idea of a threat, you might want to reconsider your approach.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Mysterious Scientist (The strange scientist-Jessinator) begins to shift and rattle. What seemed to be skin and bone was flipping and turning, to reveal a number of mechanisms. His back and arms twist and fold, and his body launches to the side with a number of mechanical creaks.

His head twists around in a three-hundred and sixty degree spiral before it swivels to face the two true Jonin. The body pieces separate and folding, allowing him to immediately slip out of the grasp of the incoming tackle.

<font color = white>&#34;We seek information, but not at the cost of warning. I’ve not come to attack, today, I’m nothing more than an embassy for words today&#34;</font>

The water off to the side begins to ripple, only noticeable by those with attuned senses or abilities such as a Byakugan. While another presence couldn’t be seen though, it could be felt. A chakra system very vaguely seen, almost as if invisible but not.

<font color = white>&#34;Power doesn’t lie in your village, it lies with us. Keep this...&#34;</font> he glances to the two Jonin, <font color = white>&#34;in mind, kids.&#34;</font> He begins to pull off, backing up from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;I bring your missing headbands as a gesture. Now, assuming you want to keep them and your lives, I think I’ll be going...&#34;</font> his beady, glass eyes, looking back and forth between the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;And if not, then we could all just...<b><i>go</b></i>&#34;</font> he begins to launch manically as he cast his eyes down to the bridge.

A bridge lined up with hundreds of explosive tags. <font color = white>&#34;If you catch my drift&#34;</font> one of the eyes winks. <font color = white>&#34;But you won’t have time to battle me and save them&#34;</font> A hand begins to form into a symbol, priming the tags but not setting them off.with only a matter of seconds at hand, would the perpetrator find battle? Or would the kids find rescue?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) yells: Shion! Protect!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The blonde-haired girl-DelusionIsBliss) looked left, then right. Blinked a few times and quickly realized she was in a situaiton way above her pay grade.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhhh...oh SHIT! RUN!&#34;</font> she exclaimed before cartoonishly scamping northwards towards the end of the bridge before she was turned into a living firework.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) quickly scanned the area and took note of his colleagues. He felt an ominous presence but couldn&#39;t quite make it out. As one of the scientist&#39;s hands began forming a symbol, his heart dropped. For a split second, he felt frozen before his adrenaline dumped. <font color = white>&#34;We need to GO!&#34;</font> he said, trying to stir the others to action.</font></font></font>

His instincts kick in sharply. With a quick assessment of the surroundings and the looming danger, he darts to the side, his movements swift and agile as he attempts to evade the potential blast radius.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</font> Sogeki mutters under his breath, adrenaline coursing through him. He doesn&#39;t engage with the scientist directly, realizing the immediate need to prioritize the safety of himself and the others. His mind races with thoughts of escape routes and strategies to mitigate the imminent threat without escalating the situation further.

As he moves swiftly away from the danger zone, Sogeki&#39;s gaze flickers back towards the scientist and the assembled Jonin. His expression is a mix of frustration and determination, knowing that the situation has escalated beyond a mere confrontation. With a resolve to regroup and strategize further, he gestures urgently for the others to follow suit, seeking cover and safety from the unfolding chaos.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) jumps forward, placing himself behind the grotesque form before him, threatening to hurt the new generation of shinobi. The Hyuuga was a proud man, believing himself to be the strongest- but he was not foolhardy enough to assume he could both protect and attack at the same time.

In times like this, Matsu knew he could rely on the blessed vessel of the tailed beast. He relinquished all thought of defence and went on an immediate offence. He landing with a heavy thud, poised to attack.

A fraction of a second passed.

A large circle seemed to appear below him and the soon-to-be corpse. Before that very same second ended, Matsu had began a flurry of blows.

<font color = white>&#34;Juukenho!&#34;</font> He shouted, as he delivered two blows. Immediately he delivered 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64 blows! <font color = white>&#34;Hakka Hyaku Bijuhanaho!&#34;</font>

The very ground everyone is standing on begins to cave and quake, leaving nothing but rough terrain not easily crossed to scamper away from. The attacker would rock the puppet’s pieces, only to find the deformed body of a young child inside - his fists now digging into a thin young sternum and lifeless corpse.

The body itself, blowing up once it had been breached. Leaving the attacking Hyuuga with moderate injuries from the resulting explosion.

Papers reign down from above after smoke clears - with a singular message <b><i>we are already here.</b></i> Each of the students just barely scraping by with nothing more than minor injuries as they’re protected from the resulting explosions by their commanders. 
After all that’s left - nothing but splinters and chunks of a young boy’s body remain. The hyuuga’s palms soaked in the child’s blood. A child of Amegakure - a Genin, no less.

The expert use of the water jutsu saved the students from most of the despair, with nothing but be try minor injuries as a result

The muscular man tries to shield his face but is blasted backwards. He has enough sense to force a roll and lands on one knee, bleeding from various cuts- and his own hands covered in someone else&#39;s blood.

He stands, realizing the attack was over. He spits the saliva and blood from his mouth, not seeming to care that he just battered a child&#39;s corpse.

Though it went undetected, the academy student would shift his left foot enough to form a fluid stance, should he be forced to engage in combat. 

Remaining silent he continued to eye the figures on the bridge, absorbing as much information as possible despite the lack of context in their coded-language. Should any of the senior shinobi take notice, the boy was display many analylitical skills commonly displayed by interrogators. 

Retaining as much information as possible, the child continue to make mental notes.</font></font></font>

She didn&#39;t really speak her way, or try to make eye contact in any way, she just rested against a larger chunk of the collapsed bridge. <font color = white>&#34;Thats not what I mean, exactly-- Forget it..&#34;</font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) reaches into his open robes and pulls out what seems to be an endless amount of scrolls, handing them out to everyone who seemed in need of basics.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#006600>Hyuuga, Matsu (The pale-eyed martial artist-Espinoza11) seemed to instantly snap into his happy-go-lucky attitude, making the disparity of his two personalities give an uncomfortable feeling.</font></font></font>

Mikazuki still had her mouth still slightly gaped, all the while she positively nodded as if agreeing to them, in whatever.

It&#39;s made from herbs that grow around our compound, it&#39;s a natural analgesic, just rub some where it hurts.&#34;</font> A soft smile is quickly painted over the slightly older Hyuugas face before she gets up..

A quick pat of her kimono and she begins to walk away, in the direction of the Hyuuga compound.</font></font></font>
