<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) arrives from deeper into the village, whistling as she arrives at the restored bridge. <font color = white>&#34;Oh neat, it&#39;s actually fixed, love that.&#34;</font> She commented, as her gaze scrutinized the nearby individuals.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Fun..?&#34;</font>

She pauses, her pointing finger instead coming up to her cheek where she lightly taps. There wasn&#39;t any particular word for what she felt doing that. &#39;Fun&#39; almost felt too simple. Anything extra would be doing too much. Unable to come up with a solution, she merely shrugged in response.

     <font color = white>&#34;I guess. He&#39;d just better watch his mouth next time...&#34;</font> she grumbles.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I just hope he isn't one of those guys to try again and again..
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Hey Afro, whats inside that weird backpack you got..
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Maybe we should find out...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e33d3d>Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) yawns a bit.

<font color = white>&#34;I hope I find a teacher some day.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I think I'm ready to learn some good things.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) paused for a moment before he moved his hand from his side towards his chin then speaking up, once again. 
    <font color = white>&#34;I feel he may be th&#39;type. Though, y&#39;can&#39;t help it I guess. Jus&#39; hope they don&#39;t try to jump you. Then again - I could join fighting &#39;em at that point.&#34;</font>, he spoke, beginning to chuckle a bit.

Fun via combat was something that didn&#39;t <i>fancy</i> him per se. But there wwas definitely monetary value when it comes to <b>combat</b> and the likes. Something this kid had an eye for.
    <font color = white>&#34;Then again, y&#39;seem strong enough to take on most on yer own, so there may be no need for that.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Someone got attacked..? Man, I go pray at the shrine for a day and so much happens.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) continues to oogle over the Uzumaki's strange back adornment...</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) turned around, <font color = white>&#34;Um.... nothing really just some clothes for me to shift between but doesn&#39;t your eyes reveal things like that&#34;</font>.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh..? It's just a weird shape.. And no, silly! I don't walk just casually peek at people with my eyes, plus that is not how it works.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) taps her chin a few times, while her right foot rhytmically follows.. Deviant cogwheels turning within the young girls mind. <font color = white>&#34;But you know.. I totally could..&#34;</font>

Was she joking? Or was this the start of her peeping era.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) scoffed at the very notion.

     <font color = white>&#34;If <i>it</i> decides <i>it</i> wants to jump me, that&#39;ll be the day I make <i>its</i> face a permanent part of the bridge.&#34;</font> she responds.

Even with that threat and notion, she can&#39;t help but try and shrug it off again.

<font color = white>&#34;Hopefully they just drop the whole thing..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Uzumaki, Afro(The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) OOCs: (sorry my girlfriend has me on the phone so it's hard to focus.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (hey no worries, were just chillin)
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Oh wow.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmn, yeah, hopefully. They might carry th'grudge, but I doubt they're dumb enough to try this charade again..
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) asks: Can I see your weird backpack?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Probably not with me.. but they'll try their luck with the cabbage kid..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Perhaps, perhaps. Maybe they'll have a better chance? Either way, out of our hands. However, I may call it a night.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Yer name was Hana right?
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Hrm...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) leans in. She brings her hand to the side of her face whilst her voice drops to a mere hush.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Huh. You going to sleep, cousin?
<br><font color=teal>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: I mean, I've been asleep this whole time, so. I can't blame you.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) asks: Did I miss anything?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hey excuse me.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice before busting out into a fit of laughter. Whilst it may have been quite a small topic to laugh at - it was quite funny to him before he began to speak to his cousin.
     <font color = white>&#34;Nawl, other than some scuffling and such. Was entertaining for the most part. But now it&#39;s my turn to do that standing-and-sleeping routine. Oh, right.&#34;</font>
    After speaking he turned to lean to whisper back, his voice carrying his previous joyful tune. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I need to make 1000 ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Can someone help?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: A job maybe?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) asks: Sensei?
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Thats a big number.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Quite.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: That's like.. Eight or nine construction shifts.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Its not cheap being a shinobi.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: ..I don't think all of us combined have that kind of cash to throw around.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: What do you need it for? Maybe I can pitch in if its important.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Potentially jutsus and weapons.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: But mainly jutsus probably.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh..yeah, no.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: I was thinking it was something more important! Like medicine or something!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Eh? We're barely learnin' th'basics and y'want that much for th'advanced shit.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Yeah, same.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: See shark boy has it figuered out!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Jutsu? Kehehahah! Hahahah. Hah. Hah. Hah.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Sorry, no.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Anyways what do I call you guys, shark boy was kinda rude, sorry.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I'm Jinbeisame. Though y'can do like my friend 'ere and call me 'Beisame'.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: I am Satoru, Daigen.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666699>Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) jabbed a thumb at their chest.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Saigosame. I don&#39;t have a fun nickname like Jinbeisame over there.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Saisame.. Gosame..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Juts-- Anyway! If you're ever looking for me, just call out for 'Hana'. I'll answer. That or someone who knows me will.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) &#39;s eyes seem to scrutinize the two males indiscriminetly. <font color = white>&#34;Sweet, cool names, I&#39;m Higane.&#34;</font> She paused, clicking her lips before continuing.

<font color = white>&#34;Hi-ga-ne&#34;</font> She&#39;d add as her name continues to be mispronounced by many for whatever reason.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hiii-gaaa-neee. Gotcha'.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) gives a thumbs up!</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: No... no no no. You know what.. close enough.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) scratched at the side of her head. This wasn't supposed to be confusing!</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Hmhm... Hig-annie.
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Well there goes my quest for awesome jutsu..
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: What jutsu are you even interested in, Daigen.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: So.. Not Hee-Gaahh--Naay... but Hiii--Gaa--Nee?
<br><font color=green>*Sotoru, Daigen (The dark skinned kid-Kurikchan) says: Hm. Well Katon for one along with shurikenjutsu perhaps.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh... maybe I come up with a nickname instead-- Oh sweet, that sounds cool.. You have an affinity for that? I have no elemental affinity according to the chakra papers.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: No one from my clan really does, its weird. Maybe we're aliens.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: I mean, I don't think *everything* has a certain affinity for chakra.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Like goats! You think every goat would utilize a different element? That'd be too complicated.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: I feel as though it'd be easy to guess my affinity.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Erm.. guess you're right.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Lets see..
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Though I plan t'use nothing but weapons and shit.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) comes closer to Jinbeisame.. a sharp pair of eyes clock even the most minute of details from his visage. 

<font color = white>&#34;Im gonna go with...Earth!&#34;</font> She confidently speaks, placing her hands at her hips. 

<font color = white>&#34;Yup, ya look earthy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Hm, lightning.. 
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) yells: No, no.. Look at Beisame! He's totally the kind of fish-guy that likes to fry!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Right?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: ..!

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: How could I be so foolish.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) rubs her eyes vigriously.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Thanks for asking though!
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: But, well.. There's a problem.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) asks: Hmm..?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) laxly pointed a finger towards the male&#39;s gills.

     <font color = white>&#34;Wouldn&#39;t breathing Katon mess with your chest? You&#39;d be turnin&#39; yourself into seafood!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) inhaled and exhaled. This was such a worry he did <i>NOT</i> take into place. 

<font color = white>&#34;Oh God, you&#39;re right.. That means it must be..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: ...!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Fuuton!!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) snaps. She&#39;d snatch the words right out of his mouth.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) raises her arms in triumphant cheer.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#808080>Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) released a sigh, <font color = white>&#34;Why do I keep forgetting your name... dude with the straw hat?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Saigosame (The shark-like boy-Dilithium) says: Oh. Uh... Saigosame.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Agreed.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: If I were able to learn an element it would be water manipulation.. Suiton is just so cool!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Woooh, I forgot all about Suiton, believe it or not..

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh I thought we did the other day? I'm Higane, Hi-ga-ne.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: I wonder if my brother is around.. Hmm.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) dissapears deeper into the village..</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: True.. I'm sleepy, if you see my brother around bother him for me! 
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: His name is Hisane.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) gives a simple wave and smile before dissapearing towards the Hyuuga compound.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) sneaks up on Mikazuki.. She&#39;s as stealthy as a snake approaching its target! As she nears her self-proclaimed best friend, she pounces like a lioness! 

The younger girl recieves a tight hug from behind. <font color = white>&#34;Sup! Bestie!&#34;</font> She shouted in surprise.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hyuuga, Higane(The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) OOCs: (19 or higher u saw me coming!)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) <font color = white>&#34;We~ll, crowds aren&#39;t really the best for muggin&#39;..&#34;</font>
The girl mentions whilst giving the bow a pat on the head. Turning her attention back to the plaid eyed girl, she goes to speak- only to see them getting flanked with an embrace. 
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. pft.&#34;</font> Leaving them be, she turns her attention back to the kid. <font color = white>&#34;-anyway. I miss anythin&#39; major?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a257ec>Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) continued to stare at the sukeban idly, blinking once after an unaturally long amount of time glaring them.

They&#39;d widen her plaid eyes when she suddenly felt arms wrapping about her, a shiver came quite immediately on the first moments of contact, and yells. <font color = white>&#34;AAAAAAH!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Boop!
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Yah miss me huh, Mika?! I know you did.

Moving forward, the bot would adjust himself to take a seat along the steps leading up tot he village&#39;s monument. 

<font color = white>&#34;How have you been, I haven&#39;t seen you since enrollment it feels like.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: ...Hmmm... I believe I'm being assaulted.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: By who!? I'l get em! I got your back bestie.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) throws a few stray air jabs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) says: I didn't really pay any attention to them. It was just an order that I was following really.

   <font color = white>&#34;Oi! Remember- don&#39;t get involved unless ye&#39; know &#39;em, or you&#39;re gettin&#39; paid.&#34;</font>

With those words of wisdom(?) shared, the delinquent tucks her hands in her pockets and steps out from betweem him and them, to walk down the stairs.
   <font color = white>&#34;But-- I&#39;ve been good. Nothin&#39; changes... What about you?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) pipes up, the mention of the commander spurring the girl to action. She approaches the duo of off-white haired youth. Attached to her hip are a standard pair of sandals-- ones clearly too small for her to wear.

Her own feet bare nothing more than wraps. <i>Strange</i>

     <font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t worry about that anymore. I took care of it.&#34;</font> she states to the reserved youth.</font></font></font>

She gives them a quick once-over before cracking a little grin. Turning to face them in earnest, she steps up and drops the tip of her finger down at the blonde&#39;s shoeless, dripless feet.

<font color = white>&#34;Hah! What&#39;sa matter, can&#39;t afford some <i>shoes?&#34;</font></i> She emphasizes the word by giving the sandles strapped at the blonde&#39;s hip a condescending flick.
   <font color = white>&#34;Ya&#39; may as well put those on, y&#39;know. Make yourself look a lil&#39; less homeless.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A mere slip of the tongue.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: . . O-okay. Just makin' sure.

<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: I meanI have an itch.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) squints, her eyes taking note of the unfamiliar face. Her eyes needn&#39;t follow the finger-- the comment is something that the blonde had become accustomed to as of late.

     <font color = white>&#34;They&#39;re just a waste of money. Bunch of wraps&#39;ll get the job done.&#34;</font> She responds. Her own hands move towards the pair clipped to her person. She taps them once and then--

<font color = white>&#34;&#39;Sides. These are bein&#39; held on Red Commanders orders.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) awaited her impending doom.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Good match.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: enough gambling for today.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Yo Najiro, Spot me 20 ryo.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: Why?
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: im collecting them for..something

<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: I just need 20 ryo. I'll pay you back double later.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Hmmm...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) asks: I think the Tournament was canceled?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: ...i won't buy stuff from the local blacksmiths bill
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Trust me..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) twitched. 

   <font color = white>&#34;It hasn&#39;t finished, so many people seemed to vanish,&#34;</font>

She then shifted towards the young Student, her hand easing back to nestle the hilt of a massive blade adorned across her back. An Odachi of gigantic mass, and weight yet she eased back once she realized what was about to occur. 

She had no reason to inflict lasting harm, not now but perhaps later.

   <font color = white>&#34;I forgive you,&#34;</font>

A cold-stir of words, and she moved to extend her hand and SLAM it into her stomach much as she had done someone else earlier today. A brief adjustment in behavior if anything. 

She then moved to ease back towards her spot, and her hand pushed back behind her back to meet the other one. 

[B Striking Speed][Stomach]</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6699ff>Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) push up off the ground and made his way over towards the hoshigaki.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Mikazuki (The plaid eyed girl-SapphireStrawberry) says: Oh no they're dead.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (atm blacksmith npcs are broken

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yakushi, Najiro(The black haired male-Colem) OOCs: (i reported it today
<br><font color=teal>*Hozuki, Kryugetsu (The reserved boy-Kryu) whispers faintly.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (yah, I'm trying to set it up with folks and get some items made to hand out.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: It's for something else.
<br><font color=green>*Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) says: Just help a fellow shinobi out.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Torizuka, Botan(The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) OOCs: (like headbands n stoof.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I won't give anymore money.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Considering today they didn't called us for work on that bridge.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Afro (The afro haired kid-Alex Ovide) says: Anyone want to pair up with me? Kinda want to make some reliable friends that I can depend on...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) <font color = white>&#34;A waste of money, huh...&#34;</font>
The sentiment didn&#39;t sit right with her. Instead of suggesting she nab the shoes off of another, the Hozuki opts to disprove the notion right then and there. Just as she was about to go dig up some sharp gravel for the girl to walk across, her attention was stolen by a blurred movement nearby.

By the time she got her eyes centered on the dancer, their fist had already connected, leaving her to watch in awe as the student, presumably, buckled and fell from the weight behind the strike.
   <font color = white>&#34;-.. Damn.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Higane.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) knew that the moment following the slip of her tongue were simply the calm before the storm.
    As the muscular, odachi wielding shinobi approached her Nahoko remained as silent and as still as possible. Perhaps somewhere in the back of her mind she thought that if she didn&#39;t move or make a sound she wouldn&#39;t be the nail that got hammered.

   Unfortunately that wasn&#39;t the case as the act of the elder shinobi&#39;s fist slamming into her stomache at a speed far exceeding her contention instantly caused her to double over in agony.
       A few dry heaves reverberated through the area as an intense, burning pain spread through the girl&#39;s body in relation to the action.

<font color = white>&#34;T-that...scratched my itch.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) sharp eyes clock the lightning fast punch from afar, yet she failed to see when it was released..

She stared onwards with a blank look in her face. The words of Najiro snapping her out of it. <font color = white>&#34;Damn.. huh? What&#39;s up Naji.&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: I am glad to be of service.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) There&#39;s a familiarity in the dashing that takes place. In the instant that the blow connects with the fellow-blonde&#39;s stomach, her own hand moves to protect her gut.

     <font color = white>&#34;B-Believe me.. She&#39;s not walkin&#39; that off easily..&#34;</font> she comments absently, her palm nursing a freshly mended wound.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: You missed some stuff happening recently
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: The reconstruction of the bridge...the village announcement..that...weird commander.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: With that, I have a few small things to say.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Oh, did I? I took a trip with my parents to pray at a shrine. I was gone a few days.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Noting very important to be honest but...it was something
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: One, I would advise you all avoid loitering on the bridge for now - unless someone is with you.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Aye, aye!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Two, I want you all to find groups or figure out people you wish to work with. This will assist in formation of Squads.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: A Squad is a group of people you will protect no matter the cost, this is a second family.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) yells: Aye, aye, times two!
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: And, I want you all to consider who you wish to have lead that squad amongst the three of you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) lifts a hand.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Totally cool..
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: Fffffawww-- okay.

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Eh? I don't think that would be a good idea.

<br><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Correct, if you don't have a squad? I'll find you one.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) asks: hm...why not?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: We should spread out our medical aid.. I read in one of the books I sto-- I mean, I heard that there's usually only one medic per squad.
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) says: Pfff...
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Ahem.. Yeah.

They asked, looking at a small scroll in their hand that they had found in the library.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: I already know their..favorites.
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Its whoever follows blindly

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: You get me? Makes no sense for both of us to-- Oh...
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) says: Hm? Perhaps Bill, once we have taught you all a few techniques.
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: That sounds personal.
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) asks: Don't those old crones have anything better to do than to lord over us kids?
<br><font color=green>*Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) says: -- No offense.
<br><font color=green>*Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) says: Naji the type to get his squad killed because he stopped to think rather than acting.
<br><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Who follows us blindly?
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: Naji is the type that will save his allies in battle! He's gonna be a great medic!

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) yells: That was rude blondie!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) says: Following blindly is different than following orders.

Such a hold caused a cry to escape from his body. Yelping across the yard in a state of pure panic.
      <b><i><font color = white>&#34;Owowowowow.. Okay-okay-okay, you win, letgo-letgo-letgo&#34;</font></b></i>, his panic jibber-jabble multiplying as the pinch held on.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) asks: Log?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) <font color = white>&#34;Huh.&#34;</font>

As plainly as the sharp-toothed one next to her states it, the blonde herself nods in tandem. Its quite simple-- simple enough that it resonates with her own core.

      <font color = white>&#34;Makes sense to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) quickly moved to do as she had done before, and produced a singular shiny-metallic item from within her sleeve. This time? It was a Shuriken, a singular Shuriken - it wasn&#39;t much but it was still free.

She handed it over.

blinked.

She just blinked; it took a moment for her to come back to reality, and she found herself enraged albeit subtly while she moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve. It was a singular steel-laced, carbon flushed, and well designed Shuriken. 

She moved to hand it over towards the young Student, and once he took it? She opted to do what she often did in such situtations, and that was extending her hand forward and suddenly lurching the young man up and into the air. 

She wouldn&#39;t throw him to the ground, nah - she simply moved to toss him into a nearby tree. He wouldn&#39;t be harmed, just stunned.

The Hozuki&#39;s brow furrows as she fervorously counts on her fingers. Just as she&#39;s about to kick the Chuunin&#39;s shin and call her a smelly cheater, she was spared and given a <i>feasible</i> question. She hisses out a sigh of relief before jutting a thumb towards herself.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) places her right hand on her chin and her left hand behind her back, quickly weaving a half seal with the hidden hand.

The veins, arteries and capilaries around her eyes bulge and slowly move across her face adorning them with jagged lines of raised skin. As her already sharp eagle eyes, awaken to their true state.

<font color = white>&#34;These are called Chakra nodes or Tenketsu.&#34;</font> As she spoke Higane, pointed straight towards Botan, her finger perfectly aimed at the Chunin&#39;s Tenketsu points.

<font color = white>&#34;The three most vital.. Hmm.. I&#39;d say the ones near the brain, heart and lungs.. Unless you mean the actual chakra gates, thats a different story!&#34;</font> She&#39;d say in a serious tone, not unlike her usual comments.</font></font></font>

   <font color = white>&#34;That is correct, and for extra credit - what happens when you break these gates and allow Chakra to flow uncontrolled?,&#34;</font>

She had already moved to draw a weapon from within her sleeve, but which weapon would she decide upon?</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Neku (The pale-eyed rapper-Darkshadew23) asks: Break the wha now yo?

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) scans the Chunins body, scrutinizing her chakra network with the aid of the Byakugan. <font color = white>&#34;Hm..An interesting theory.. If possible, but that sounds like a fairy tale..  I&#39;ve never read about any of that in the medical books I&#39;ve sto-- I mean, borrowed.&#34;</font>

She&#39;d then slowly ponder the question for a few brief moments before offering a respone. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;d gues in theory, the gates would no longer impede the flow of chakra, allowing for its unrestricted flow.. So perhaps an increase in power?..&#34;</font> She&#39;d rationalyse the proposed theory.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Hmm...Higane i got a question
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: If you can touch any tenketsu point

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc3399>Torizuka, Botan (The dark skinned dancer-Alt Cunningham) smirked.

   <font color = white>&#34;That would be quite correct, unrestricted flow would allow someone to unleash the full length of their abilities unhindered,&#34;</font>

That young Hyuuga would see nothing out of the normal, outside the fact that her network was quite a raging wildfire of intensely flowing energy. She held her own secrets - and the network never lied. 

   <font color = white>&#34;In theory,&#34;</font>

A moment and her hand was presented, with -two- Senbon. They were tossed towards her.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: Or any very lethal tenketsu point.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) catches the senbon with ease, tucking them inbetween her fingers as if she&#39;d practice it a thousand times before..

The vessels around her eyes relax as her Byakugan deactivates. <font color = white>&#34;I see.. Huh..&#34;</font> She&#39;d comment, tucking the senbon into her medic pouch.

<font color = white>&#34;Well if I&#39;d known you were gonna ask me about anatomy and stuff I&#39;d volunteer first! Miss Botan..!&#34;</font> She&#39;d jest returning to her playful demeanor as she backs off with a whistle.</font></font></font>

His arms are folded, and he watches his classmates with a focused intensity. Unlike his usual assertive demeanor, he chooses silence over action, content to observe the unfolding events with a reserved demeanor.

In this moment of calm amidst chaos, Sogeki's presence is palpable yet understated. His eyes scan the surroundings, taking in every detail with a thoughtful and analytical gaze. It's clear he's not here to dominate or assert himself overtly but rather to understand and strategize. Amidst the charged atmosphere of determination and pride, Sogeki's measured approach stands out, hinting at a deeper calculation and readiness to act when the time is right.</font></font></font>

He blinks, with a little curious tilt from his own head as he watches Sogeki. The puzzled look on his soft features was giving away his uncertainty about the other's seeming attitude. He would look away should the other try to meet his gaze. He wasn't interested in picking a fight with someone who looked like they put rocks in their own shoes for fun.</font></font></font>

They said, moving the torch closer to their face, their eyes filled with curiosity. They were trying to familiarize themselves with the feeling of the heat, inhaling and exhaling in a crude attempt to train their Katon affinity.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki stands amidst the bustling activity of his peers, a subtle awareness prickling at the edge of his senses. He feels the weight of someone's gaze upon him, a piercing stare trying to draw his attention. Keeping his arms folded across his chest, he remains outwardly composed, his expression unreadable.

His gaze drifts off into the distance, not directly meeting the source of the glare but aware of its presence. The atmosphere around him buzzes with energy, conversations blending into a low hum that he tunes out effortlessly. Sogeki's mind wanders briefly, contemplating the day's events and the tasks ahead.

Then, a movement catches his eye—a flicker of motion on the edge of the training ground. It's an interaction he hasn't seen before, unfolding with intrigue and curiosity. Intrigued, Sogeki's focus shifts, his analytical mind now fully engaged as he observes with a keen interest, temporarily forgetting the lingering sensation of someone's scrutiny.</font></font></font>

They said, passing it to the veteran.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#993300>Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) studied him for a moment. To trust one&#39;s words so blindly... It almost went with that conversation they all had earlier.

It brought an idea to mind.

      <font color = white>&#34;Hey.&#34;</font> She called, her voice dropping to a hushed whisper afterwards.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Jinbeisame's a cool guy! His favorite element was fire I believe.. or was that his cousin.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) blinked twice. Was he truly a <i>freak of nature</i>. Would that be a compliment or a insult.. Little is known.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) felt his skin crawling, as if he had been betrayed. He quickly shook it off <font color = white>&#34;Preposterous&#34;</font> he thought, walking closer to the group of people. None of his peers would dare sleight the great Asa. <font color = white>&#34;I need to buy some new shoes&#34;</font> he mumbled as he promptly stubbed his toe on the elevated platform.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) pulls the skin under her right eye down a bit, while sticking out her tongue. <font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s his nickname, dummy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) Sogeki's gaze sharpened as he recognized the familiar aura—sharp, unyielding, like a blade slicing through the air. It was the stern bastard from a few days ago, the one who dared to challenge him openly. Without shifting his stance, Sogeki turned his attention towards the source of the voice, his eyes fixing on the shark-like boy.

Their eyes locked in a silent duel, each assessing the other with unspoken intensity. Sogeki's stare was icy, piercing, as if daring the other to meet his gaze head-on. He conveyed a silent challenge through his unwavering glare, a message of defiance and readiness to engage if provoked.

Despite the tension, Sogeki remained composed, arms folded across his chest, exuding an air of quiet confidence. He waited, patient yet vigilant, observing how the sharkboy would react under his unwavering scrutiny.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Yakushi, Najiro (The black haired male-Colem) says: And for your knowledge,i read medical books,but at other times a different sorts of ones aswell
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff3300>Rasputin, Bill (The boy who smells of cabbage-Lv.5 Magikarp) looked at the veteran,the commander, as they spoke, and he wondered what fate they had just doomed his peer to.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) stared blankly at Sogeki. He pushed his glasses up, the sunlight glinting off the lenses dramatically. He pointed, positioning his body sideways. <font color = white>&#34;You act like a robot. I&#39;d fight you now but alas...&#34;</font> He tilted is head down sadly, <font color = white>&#34;I am without shoes.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) was being chased?! This was no good. His rolling wasn&#39;t taking him far.
<font color = white>&#34;New plan.&#34;</font>

He was going to do the most unstoppable means of escape. Springing out of his ball form and then going completely still. Like a...like uhh...-like a STATUE!!</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) The squint didn&#39;t leave Sogeki&#39;s face. The embedding threat that stands before him.. it rocks Sogeki&#39;s core. Naturally, he&#39;s shaking in his boots.. But he refuses to dishonor the Satetsu name by back down.

Sogeki stands strong-- and steps forward even stronger.

The aggressive lad accepts his fate.
  <font color = white>&#34;Ready to accept my consequences. I simply allow for at least a two on one opportunity. I wish for my father to recognize my body after this.. Commander.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Satetsu, Sogeki(The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) OOCs: (by backing*)
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Mm..

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) inched a bit forward.. still confused by what was developing infront of her, before asking. <font color = white>&#34;Help with what...?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f2c2c>Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) approaches Sogeki and settles a large hand on their shoulder, his figure towering them easily. <font color = white>&#34;My soldiers do <i>not</i> yield. But I admire such personality.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The hunt will be retracted. Tell me your name.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Asa(The stern boy-Kieruu) OOCs: (i am possessed

The weight of the veteran&#39;s hand on his shoulder is both comforting and imposing, a reminder of the authority he carries. Sogeki meets the veteran&#39;s gaze with a defiant glare, the flames of determination burning fiercely in his eyes despite the fear that churns within him.

He stands his ground, unwilling to show weakness despite the overwhelming presence of the veteran. Sogeki knows the importance of respect in the shinobi world, especially when facing someone of higher rank. Yet, beneath the surface, his resolve remains unbroken, a testament to his unwavering spirit amidst the intimidating atmosphere.

<font color = white>&#34;..of the Satetsu. But soon everyone will call me the Kraken Slayer.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hana, Tsukiko (The profound blonde-DragonQuestVIII) asks: ...Are they?

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: If my soldier says they will obtain a title then that it is how it will be.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) asks: Do you understand?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) stared in complete astonishment. Beginning to wonder if this boy named <i>Blast</i> was sent here by some cosmic entity.. Though - sleep or not.. Still or not! 

                         <b><i>HE HAD A JOB TO DO.</b></i>

Manipulating his body in such a dramatic fashion as if he was a <i>snake</i>. His presence looming over behind him. It was time. <b><i>Fifty damned Ryo was at stake!</b></i>
      <i><font color = white>&#34;Pin him down as I~...!&#34;</font></i>

The half-shark would grasp the top of his briefs, wasting no time before hopping over his body soon after. Delivering a <i>vicious</i> <b><i>WEDGIE</b></i>! Certainly giving Asa some flashbacks of his very own from the day prior. Landing over the boy he would stand proud. A grin sprayed over his face.

Sogeki thinks for a moment, then shrugs. He eases into the comfort of the topic.
  <font color = white>&#34;I do.&#34;</font>

<font color = white>&#34;But not without cause. Even if it&#39;s frowned upon by the public.. if it needs to be done. I&#39;ll do it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

That is his S-rank mission afterall.

The study each of them and gift them tasks and an environment that will benefit their growth.

<font color = white>&#34;Fine,&#34;</font> he starts, squeezing the boy&#39;s shoulder, <font color = white>&#34;Kraken Slayer must be earned.&#34;</font>

A punch occurs, far too fast to be seen by anyone around. It plants into Sogeki&#39;s stomach with cratering force.

His hand falls from the boy&#39;s shoulder, leaving them to relish in the impacts recoil.

<font color = white>&#34;Now. Why do I see someone giving wedgies?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) didn&#39;t care anymore. His face, having been pasted full of horror, stayed facing the ground. His tone speaking as if he was already dead.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) side-eyes the Hoshigaki whom had fallen victim to the bad example set by the laborer the day before.

    Whilst everyone was looking towards the Hoshigaki Nahoko stole a moment to check up on her hair in the reflection of the monument north o fher.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) steps to the side. She gives the half-shark a reassuring pat on the shoulder to help ease the woes he felt; unaware that he was about to get thwarted by the commander himself.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) prayed he <i>at least</i> got the fifty ryo. To pay for his future medical bills or something.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) yells: PUNISH HIM!!

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) points menacingly at his attempted assaulter.

<font color = white>&#34;..ok.&#34;</font>
Then he waddles over at impecable speed.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) &#39;s body jerks forward as the veteran&#39;s fist slams into his stomach with brutal force. The impact sends a shockwave of pain through him, causing him to grit his teeth and stagger backward. His hands instinctively clutch at his abdomen, trying to alleviate the intense ache that spreads from the point of impact.

Despite the pain, Sogeki locks eyes with the crimson-haired veteran, his gaze unwavering. His pride refuses to let him show weakness or back down, even in the face of such a harsh lesson. He takes a deep breath, swallowing his pride along with the pain, and straightens up slowly, though the discomfort is evident on his face.

<font color = white>&#34;I understand,&#34;</font> Sogeki manages to say through clenched teeth, his voice strained but defiant. He exhales sharply, willing himself to remain composed despite the throbbing pain in his gut. His eyes remain fixed on the veteran, a silent acknowledgment of the respect he holds for the commander&#39;s authority.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: One of you will be punished for unorderly conduct.

<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: Drainage of your chakra.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) stood there silently.

Then he broke the silence.
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m confused. Do we still have to be silent?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9966ff>Hozuki, Miakigetsu (Sharp-toothed sukeban-Boomwidakill) regretably shakes her head. <i>How far we have fallen.</i></font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) says: Shh...
<br><font color=green>*Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) says: If you had like a piece of paper I could point to pick.

     <font color = white>&#34;Oh.. That&#39;s..&#34;</font>

When he walked back over, she observed his demeanor and that call he made-- She, too, widened her eyes with shock. Not one ounce of her wanted to imagine what that felt like. 

Before she could offer a hand or deliver his justice..

He was gone.

Who else isn&#39;t?&#34;</font></i> Asa thought as he scanned the area, scrutinizing his colleagues. His eyes yet again landed on Sogeki, boring holes in his trousers. Holes of pure judgment. <i><font color = white>&#34;I bet he isn&#39;t. I bet he&#39;s commando. Right now.&#34;</font></i></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) unlatched his cloak, tossing it to the side. It is irrelevant. A hunt for him? Alive or dead? It would not matter.
    His arm sliding out of his sleeve as his upper body laid bare. Turning southbound to face Sogeki. The student granted the privilege of hunting and punching him. This was perfectly fine to him.

The neck of his cracked as he readied himself. His right hand raising itself, motioning in a &#39;<i>come on, then</i>&#39; gesture. Thus he spoke finally.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>Hunt me? Fine then, let&#39;s do it. Punch me? Do it..</b>&#34;</font>, his finger pointed in Najiro&#39;s direction, his face grinning widely as he continued.
     <font color = white>&#34;<b>This is what it means t&#39;follow orders!!! I want you to hunt me with all yer might.. It&#39;s yer order, Najiro. Whether it&#39;s right or wrong - you commit to it!!!</b>&#34;</font>

               Finally, the gaze of the boy turned back to Sogeki, his grin spreading as his body flared up. His blue-scaled hand beated his chest as he spoke. <font color = white>&#34;<b>Let&#39;s not hold th&#39;Commander up. Deliver yer blow.</b>&#34;</font>, he spoke. His hand gesturing to begin this matter, once more.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) twiddled his thumbs, trying not to seem <b>too</b> concerned. <font color = white>&#34;Just go easy on Higananane. She&#39;s a girl, after all... Not that I care.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#5f5f5f>Satetsu, Sogeki (The aggressive one-DhatBoiNick) paces up to the half-shark, admiration for their acceptance of judgment clear upon his face. Though respect is established and recognized to be mutual, duty calls. Sogeki cocks his arm back and sends it flying towards the aquatic hybrid.

<font color = white>&#34;..for the Commander,&#34;</font> Sogeki whispers.

The impact of his action is felt heavily in the tense silence that follows, hanging in the air as a testament to the Commander&#39;s authority and the consequences of crossing it.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) thought about it. Questions. Questions are important. Questions get answers. Questions like 'How hard is he going to punch Haginini? Is the commander a man or woman? Where are my shoes?'</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That is good, Sogeki. Remember the pain I inflicted and unleash it upon the enemy tenfold.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: That goes for all of you.
<br><font color=teal>*Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) whispers faintly.
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: The things I have you do here are all sport but it is also preparation on how you should handle the real enemies.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc00>Goya, Nahoko (The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) watches as the blow is being delivered to the shark. The girl winces slightly, thinking back to the <b>abuse</b> she&#39;d been subjected to from the big sword wielding girl.
    Iwa was in trouble if they planned on hitting people in the stomache. <i>These kids were going through a training regimine similar to that of the Shaolin monks where they may gain immunity to pain in an area by repeated trauma.</i>

<font color = white>&#34;Oof.&#34;</font> The girl uttered under her breath.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uzumaki, Manaso (The crimson-haired veteran-Wizio) says: In the future, when you are punched in the stomach, you will shrug it off. You will laugh at it because your Commander conditioned you so.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Goya, Nahoko(The girl with blonde-hair-DelusionIsBliss) OOCs: (Aint no way)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#336699>Hyuuga, Higane (The pearl eye'd kid-Tankyboy) trembles in place as she watches the powerful blow sent towards Jinbeisame. In a panic her mind raced, all she could think was...

'It's....the commander's orders...'
They thought solemnly, finding their resolve for the task after this, knowing that the commander's favor could change their fate significantly.</font></font></font>

She makes a mental note to hide something under her hoodie to cushion some of these punches in the future.
   <font color = white>&#34;Maybe a trash can lid,&#34;</font> she mumbles under her breath.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#4d6fb2>Hoshigaki, Jinbeisame (The white-haired half-shark-Skyskeeter4) took the hit full-on. His face grimacing for a moment. <i>Just one moment.</i> Before it morphed back into it&#39;s previous position. His teeth being gritted before his posture straightened up. 

        Moving along to the side, letting the next recipient take their turn in receiving the punch from the fellow student, Sogeki.

<font color = white>&#34;<b>I &#39;ave no plan on running for a head-start in th&#39;hunt.. That shows cowardice.. I&#39;ll take m&#39;stand &#39;ere..</b>&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Asa (The stern boy-Kieruu) clenched his teeth as the punch connects with the half-shark. The reality of the situation was starting to set in for Asa. Not only are they being trained by a psychopath... They were being conditioned into psychopaths. Is this their fate?

<font color = white>&#34;<i>I&#39;ll be the best psychopath.&#34;</font></i> he thought, trying to remain positive.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff9900>Senju, Blast (The grandson of a true hero-IFuzion) smirks at the one to deliver his punishment. Waiting for them to step up and <i>punch</i> him.</font></font></font>
