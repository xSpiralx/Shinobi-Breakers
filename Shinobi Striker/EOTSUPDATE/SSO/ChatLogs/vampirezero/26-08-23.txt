<br><font color=green>*Brad (The sleepy purple one-Altro13) says: I'm Brad.

<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Oh, wait... Looks like I was invited with them.

<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: It's dirty and broken down here...

<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Some sort of ruined temple, or a fortress.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: I'm surprised they sent students so far away for a package too, this Senju lady must be important.
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) yells: Or the mission handler saw me and knew to grant us special access!
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) asks: Maybe, I forgot to ask. What's your name?
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: Haa.. special access. I wouldn't wanna be the type of special that gets sent to a filthy place like this. 
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...Hm.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) crossed her arms with a huff. She couldn't think of a come back... Ack.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) maintained a gentle smile while she watched the silent frustrations unfold. <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m Hanako, by the way.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f8fe2>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) nodded towards the two, her right hand raising up to lift up the hat that sat atop her hair, the same shade of konbu.

<font color = white>&#34;Maya, of the Gorumba orphange.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) From the corner of paled lavender orbs, she&#39;d look to the other two girls who had already introduced themselves. A few more seconds of hesitation to respond passed, or perhaps she already expected them to know about her!

<font color = white>&#34;Hinoue, of the esteemed Hyuuga clan,&#34;</font> she finally announced.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Nice to meet the both of you, perhaps we'll be placed in the same class when the new year starts.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ceb773>Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) studied the orphan and purebred both as they declared their names and social status so promptly. Huh. One&#39;s from a super prestigious family. One&#39;s from the metaphorical gutters. Meanwhile! She sat squarely in the middle. 

<font color = white>&#34;We&#39;re a balanced bunch,&#34;</font> she murmured, just a sliver below audible. Before the volume boosts back to standard for a--!

<font color = white>&#34;Likewise! I&#39;ll bet it&#39;s gonna be -so- much fun.&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f8fe2>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) raised a single eyebrow at the comment before letting out a subtle laugh. Despite being a member of a supposed orphange the girl seemed to be dressed well, high quality clothing and well manicured appearence that betrayed her status. It seemed as though they perhaps had a gig on the side, or perhaps a shady side existed to the orphange.

<font color = white>&#34;I hope so, nothing worse than a boring classroom.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) had already almost forgotten that this trio, herself included, had yet to even pass the academy! She stifled a giggle into her sleeve as they got through the system, and were seemingly undisturbed all throughout. Her perfect for them. Nevertheless! She would slowly nod in return. Connections were very important, even if their social status wasn&#39;t quite on par with what she had hoped.

They at least invited her out on a mission. Much more exciting than <i>fishing</i>.

<font color = white>&#34;I think studying is pretty fun,&#34;</font> she noted before commenting on something that was poking her mind, <font color = white>&#34;You said you&#39;re from an orphanage...? You... don&#39;t look... Well...&#34;</font>

A pause.

<font color = white>&#34;You don&#39;t look <i>too</i> poor... Why&#39;s that?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Gorumba, Maya(The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) OOCs: (forgot how to do that
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#8f8fe2>Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) With a cursory glance she sized up the two girls in order to determine ages for a natural social heirachy, however with how simillar they all were in appearence it was almost impossible for her to tell.

And then she had the question directed to herself, prompting a hand to move down towards her pouch before pulling out a scroll.

<font color = white>&#34;Well, I&#39;m a journalist... in training. The clothing was given to me by the matron, in order to stop me from standing out so much during interviews. Have to look professional and clean or nobody would speak to me!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#cc66ff>Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) blinked a few times, her expression almost as mysterious as that gaze of hers as she wondered about the works of a journalist. Or, rather, what a journalist would need to go through on a daily basis. Toes of steel to survive the number of doors closed on them-- or was that the religious fanatics? She mixes them up...

<font color = white>&#34;Oh, that makes sense actually. Yeah. The clothes help a lot. Most would just think you&#39;re trying to rob them if you weren&#39;t dressed at least like that,&#34;</font> she spoke with a nod. Her appraisal earned a minimum approval.

<font color = white>&#34;Time to go!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: ...
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) asks: --ah. That was simple. Huh?
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: Uhm.

<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: They were late..
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) yells: .. what a waste of time. Whatever!
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: As they say... It was not about the mission. It was about the friends made along the way.
<br><font color=green>*Gorumba, Maya (The kombu green-haired teen-VampireZero) says: Well, this mission never happened
<br><font color=green>*Hanako (The platinum blonde girl-Stonemill) says: I'd rather have the ryo. But. To each their own.
<br><font color=green>*Hinoue (The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) says: I don't really need the ryo anyway.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hinoue(The high-toned girl-MayaWinky) OOCs: (my agi is still E
