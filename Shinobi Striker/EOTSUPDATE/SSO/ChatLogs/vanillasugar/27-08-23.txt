<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kotsuki, Damuri(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (to remake or to have shunshin nat)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kotsuki, Damuri(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (No cooldown for shunshin, which grants two steps of melee offensive agility in the turn shunshin is used, but the user also loses two steps of defensive agility from vertigo effects.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Takuma Himotochi(The ambitious one-Plsnob) OOCs: (With sharingan you're immune to vertigo)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (i mean early on, ngl thats gonna be op sunshin adepts pretty good, i think you might have enough control for dash as a genin)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (if you get control i mean)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kotsuki, Damuri(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (yeah but i aint got no mofo sharingan..Im a nuhi bih)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (:p)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods towards people that replied. He wonders about what to do next since the Academy head was not around which was rather unfortunate.

<font color = white>&#34;I see, well then I will have to go with secondary option....unfortunate.&#34;</font>

Gosame smiles to those that have introduced themselves.

<font color = white>&#34;I am glad to have heard at least one name...its nice to meet you Sora.&#34;</font>

After saying that with quite friendly tone, Gosame repositions his hands into his hoodie pocket since his hands were slowly going numb.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kotsuki, Damuri(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (im not finna bet my build on some shit that probably wont happen lol)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Takuma Himotochi(The ambitious one-Plsnob) OOCs: (Im going medic)

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Takuma Himotochi(The ambitious one-Plsnob) OOCs: (Yes)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) had found a large group of people, taking up with the majority of them around as he tries to figure out what's going on over here</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would nod to Gosame once more. <font color = white>&#34;Aye not a problem, its always nice to meet new people, though, chief, your the highest rank here, you know who the academy teacher is?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Inuzuka, Mosai(The police chief-VantetheGreat) OOCs: (Speed gang )

<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (i team up with someone close range)
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Nice to meet you, Kaito.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (and were gonna go far
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) found himself answeing the question instinctively.

<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m looking for him, too. Oh! My name is Takeshi of the Geto clan.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Ahhh. My mistake.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only shrug his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Havent met anyone by the name of Kami, Kaito yet Takeshi Geto, names Himotachi, Sora...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Sora, huh? Like that name, nice to meet you
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) looks over to the silver-haired boy and nods his head.

<font color = white>&#34;No worry, what&#39;s your name man?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Mine is Gosame. Gosame Hoshigaki.
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Likewise, Takeshi is a great name as well
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Gosame, nice to meet you! We should battle together sometime, shark-people are badass
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) says: I am simply...  Aoi.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would turn towards Aoi. <font color = white>&#34;Well Aoi, it is a pleasure regardless.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) looks to the young lady, his head bowing sharply.

<font color = white>&#34;Hai, pleasure to meet you Aoi. Anyone else? Might as well get to know each other before spars and stuff start! Sure the HM will make us do that at some point&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Kotsuki, Damuri.
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Damuri, nice - very unique
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I'm Yoru, prey!
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Prey?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: Prey?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) looks over to the smelly boy, trying not to wince at the odor.

<font color = white>&#34;Yoru, hai. Nice to meet you&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: Prey?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) yells: Yoru! Dont call friends prey, we call enemies prey!
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) says: I thought he said his name was Yoru Prey...
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's how I took it
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: That'd be a weird last name.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looks confused at everyone repeating prey. Were they not understanding the word?

He nodded at the muscle head.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Everyone else is prey! We just protect these prey.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Hey uh...I dont like being called prey.
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Geto, Takeshi - for anyone who didn't catch it
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I"m noones prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: You are someone's prey.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Maybe not mine but prey!
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Maaaan....
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: You're not all the way there are you>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) asks: ?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would shrug his shoulders. <font color = white>&#34;Right sure....I suppose.&#34;</font> honestly alot of them were quite interesting, but quite a bit out there as well as he would move towards the building sitting down on the sidewalk, leaning against it, as he opened up a bag and took out a book to read.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hm....I mean if you think like that, it could help you fight like you were prey....adrenaline shortcut maybe
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) asks: I am not an illusion? Is prey confused?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) sighs and shakes his head, ignoring the further comments of Yoru. This certainly was an interesting group of people, but he had no time for games. He would head to the front of the academy and wait for an instructor to arrive.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where did everyone go?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) was confused a little bit by the arrival of Yoru. He did not know how to teach his kin about the conversation and proper etiquette of other Shinobi in the village that they protect.

<font color = white>&#34;Uhh...well....prey is something we hunt down and play with or hunt down and eat....but I am sure that Yoru doesnt mean it on a bad side.&#34;</font>

Gosame has begun to explain, he was wondering just why is Yoru constantly calling people prey. Was he not taught how to talk properly in public? Regardless, he didnt want to be a smartass and call him out.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) would cough a few times Yoru&#39;s smell was crazy bad <font color = white>&#34;Hey.. This has to be a crime.&#34;</font> he says his eyes watering a bit.

His hound Kane would Bark at the Smelly teen.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only chuckle. <font color = white>&#34;Why do you think that I am all the way over here chief?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) looks to Gosame with a nod

<font color = white>&#34;Ah I get it...that&#39;s okay, if he treats his enemies as prey, he&#39;ll get along with me just fine!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: If he does not, big boss will put him in place.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would only nod to them before turning to the chief. <font color = white>&#34;So, chief whats one gotta do to join the police force anyways, figured I would ask and see what happens?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: That's a good question
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Bad side? Prey is prey. No good or bad.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) stretched her arms over her hea, <font color = white>&#34;Huh.. where did everyone go?&#34;</font> She&#39;d wonder.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Everyone is here, few people left but thats about it.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) asks: Whats your name?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) looked at the hound, tilting his head.

<font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s wrong, prey? Hungry? I&#39;m not prey!&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) looks over to sora. <font color = white>&#34;To join the force.. The minimum requirement would to be a genin.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders.

<font color = white>&#34;We have a long path ahead of us, especially to become Genin. That one is really important.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read his book as he listened to the chief, when his question was answered. <font color = white>&#34;Well that is good to know chief, I might have to join when I am able to then...I think that with my skills I might be a great addition, but of course that also remains to be seen.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: My name?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Yep.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ffcc99>Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) tilted her head to the side as she eyed the sharp-toothed kid.
     <font color = white>&#34;My name&#39;s Reimi..&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Inuzuka, Mosai (The police chief-VantetheGreat) gives Sora a heads up <font color = white>&#34;I&#39;ll be looking forward to it.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) nods in understanding.

<font color = white>&#34;I am Hoshigaki Gosame. Its nice to meet you Reimi.&#34;</font>

He says with wide and happy smile, he came here to meet new people and sign up to attend the academy and become Genin to begin with.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I knew she lied.
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Reimi makes more sense.
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Obviously did you really think Nunya was their name?
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: Do I look stupid to you
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Yes
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Never said you did
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: Nunya sounds like a prey name.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: fits well.
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: You probably prey on boys
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: I do not have a preference on gender.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Damn...
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: A question though. Did anyone sign up at all? Because if not....we can just camp the academy.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue reading as he flipped to another page. <font color = white>&#34;I believe that is exactly what we are doing currently Gosame.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: I signed up!
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: Same.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: I think I signed up?
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) asks: Oh? With who?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: Thats awesome! I cant wait to sign up as well.
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) asks: Yeah, who with?
<br><font color=green>*Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) says: Shion Shiromu.
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: Yeah, let's go to the academy!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) asks: Where is it?
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: With the instructor, prey.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would point to the big building everyone is infront of.. <font color = white>&#34;This is the accademy, but it was empty when I was inside just a bit ago, still it is good to know a name of someone to look for.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) points to the building next to them with his index finger.

<font color = white>&#34;Apparently, according to the people that have been signed up already that is the academy.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: I'm on my way then!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) yells: Thanks!
<br><font color=green>*Munashi, Reimi (The charcoal haired girl-VanillaSugar) says: Here I am again
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: But there is....nobody inside I think.
<br><font color=green>*Aoi (The young lady-RinTonsaka) asks: Where is the instructor?
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) looks to the academy and back then blinks.

<font color = white>&#34;What in the...&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Least no one was Gosame when I was in there last, and no one seemed to come in and out that I have seen, I can easily go look again
<br><font color=green>*Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) says: Indeed it is still empty
<br><font color=green>*Kotsuki, Damuri (The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) says: I need to start my training.
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) says: We all have to train hard in and out of the academy.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (im sorry but uh Allies within 3 tiles of a Sarutobi are bolstered by their leadership, gaining +5 to strength, speed and stamina. At Chuunin levels this boosts the range to 6 tiles and at Jounin it peaks at 10 tiles.  the fuck? this ss seems broken as hell)
<br><font color=green>*Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) says: Hai we will.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hattori, Kichou(The bundle of clothing.-HattoriHanzu) OOCs: (Thats crazy.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (aye )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Hoshigaki, Yoru(The smelly boy-Firebird496) OOCs: (Uhm... what? That's crazy)
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) says: So many preys around now.
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (yeah, was looking at trees and bam stumbled on that gem)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Kotsuki, Damuri(The silver-haired boy-RashanTNS) OOCs: (kaguya looks broken)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Geto, Takeshi(The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) OOCs: (Even in their last moments , the greatest leaders can find a way to inspire. When taking Critical damage, the Sarutobi gains +1 Grade to speed when moving to defend an attack for an ally with the intention of taking damage. Should the member of the Sarutobi clan die from this, their allies will gain a second wind of the Will of Fire , recieving B chakra and recovering Light to their current health.)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (kaguya might seem good but sarutobi seems straight gorked)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) shrugs his shoulders while wondering about what Yoru was talking to them about. Calling people <font color = white>&#34;prey&#34;</font> is not something that should be done in public but Gosame had no say in it.

<font color = white>&#34;Yoru...one day you will call someone prey and they will beat you up. Be careful.&#34;</font>

Gosame would say with worried tone, thinking that Yoru might have some sort of brain damage.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would continue to read as he would look at the others, he had studdied about various applications and so fourth just basic information on different techniques.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me, do you guys have any interests, plan to specialize in anything?&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Inuzuka, Mosai(The police chief-VantetheGreat) OOCs: (its okay guys i got an inside man planning the Sarutobi massacare)
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#6666ff>Hoshigaki, Gosame (The sharp toothed kid-Ocnjak20) thinks about it for a moment.

<font color = white>&#34;That is a good question, I will have to talk to big boss in what we excell in and all that. Probably suiton? We are sharks afterall.&#34;</font>

Gosame would say while moving his left hand to his chin in order to think.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#00cc00>Geto, Takeshi (The muscle-head male-ChainsOfMadness) quickly nods his head,

<font color = white>&#34;I want to study taijutsu further than the readings I&#39;ve seen have. I want to go as far as my body possibly can&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yasuke(The gaped boy-Tet. Jr) OOCs: ( yo someone click my profile real quick )
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Himotachi, Sora(The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) OOCs: (your profile is empty...)
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Yasuke(The gaped boy-Tet. Jr) OOCs: ( say goodbye to ur internet )
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#0066cc>Yokai, Tajin (The undisturbed boy-Sennsa) turns his head to Sora to contribute to the conversation as best as he can as it was kinda hard for the lad to pay attention at the moment.

<font color = white>&#34;Fuuinjutsu, I&#39;ve heard it was a pretty neat thing that high level ninjas have.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Hoshigaki, Yoru (The smelly boy-Firebird496) yells: Then I shall fight the prey and it shall be fun!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff00ff>Himotachi, Sora (The strong minded teenager-RiddleEnigma) would nod to the others, he had heard what they wished to specialize in, as hee would continue to read. <font color = white>&#34;I plan to master the blade, as well as use my formidiable mind to enforce my will on others.&#34;</font> he would say this casually.</font></font></font>
