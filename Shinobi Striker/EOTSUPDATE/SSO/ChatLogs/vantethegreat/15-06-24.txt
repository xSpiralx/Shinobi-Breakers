<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) stares over across the watery platform to an explicitly recognizable face. He moves out from behind the two larger figures&#39; bodies so that his target could match his gaze.
He extends a hand, albeit returns it to his person quickly, not wanting to call the wrong attention. He really should simply just--call out her name.

<font color = white>&#34;....!!!&#34;</font> He waves meekly, nothing more.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: mm..also no problem at all... healing you is our duty even if its a paper cut Chobina
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Hehe, thank you~ I know im in good hands~
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) the young man walk up doing was looked like a jog although it was only a fast walk. He&#39;d place his hands upon his knees and exhale heavily a few times. He&#39;d look up and spot his sister.

<font color = white>&#34;Ah there you &#34;</font> Takes a deep breath <font color = white>&#34;Are What&#39;chu doin&#39;&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: a-also as long as you train hard enough Shuye!....you will become a great medical shi-...or not...not that you cant...just its..complicated...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) says: to rush out of your comfortzone...to heal someone in the heat of battle...is...not for eveyone mm..
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) felt like she was already friends with her family. So her kinship with Ume was closed rather quicktly. <font color = white>&#34;I know I can count on you Ume,  and I will help out where I can to!&#34;</font> The girl leaned on Ume affectionatly but was concerned about her size. Maybe they needed to eat more. 

Her eyes then dart to Chonamu. <font color = white>&#34;Im talking to a family member! They are drawing a flyer! Then, uh, Ms. Shuye came in becase of their medical interest! So far its been a fun night!&#34;</font> 

She snickers a bit.<font color = white>&#34; But I think I can make it more fun! I want to be an artist myself.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) caught sight of the teal-haired boy in the background. Her red eyes flicked on him, made contact-- then looked away, as if trying to ignore him for the moment. You wouldn&#39;t know it by looking at her, but she was wrestling with whether to acknowledge him or not without forcing him to speak up. It was her job as the eldest to simultaneously protect and push him, after all. She wasn&#39;t sure which needed to be done today.

Her eyes turned toward the other girl having a conversation with Cho-ko. An Akimichi, both by introduction and obvious physical traits. She didn&#39;t even need to turn around to know the one opposite her was also one. They were large, which-- Shuye could never encourage.

But then, that was important for their clan, right? It had to be. Surely they were not all gluttons without reason. Without realizing it, Shuye had begun scowling at the chubby, black girl rather intensely, and opted not to acknowledge her meek brother. Her following words pretty clearly suggested that Shuye had done a lot of growing up far, far too quickly. She turned her eyes back toward Chokoume.

<font color = white>&#34;I think I can handle that. I just hope no idiots abuse that and get themselves hurt for no good reason. Once you break a pot, it&#39;ll never be the same.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-4><font color=teal>*Zhu, Shuye(The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) OOCs: [her own meek brother* just to clarify that wasn't directed at HBK]
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) <i>'Now would be the time to get annoyed.... Right?'</i>

Nah, the girl's scowl gave a clear indicator on where exactly she held him in this interaction. Besides, there's no emergency, he gets to see her consistently anyway--it's not like she's gonna just... Up and disappear anyway.

So, the boy pats his trousers, settles down on the dusted edge of the poolside--little feet dangling off the edge. And, he waits, patiently. Though the patience subsides rather quickly, his stare exudes ferocity, unbeknownst to himself of course. Glaring daggers into the masses while he sits and waits.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b07943>Akimichi, Koume (The shadow feather-ZenchuZaaRachu) would feel a bit taken a back at the notion...though...

<font color = white>&#34;mhm..trama is definately a thing....we dont really have a...area for checking the mental state of our people.....mm..&#34;</font>

She found herself to be a bit at a loss...as she pondered on it...but soon felt the intense s-...scowl...that just registered within her brain a momento later. THough by the time she looked up to them...she noticed them staring back at her. 

<font color = white>&#34;but that would be just spreading our forces too thin...so maybe..once we have people to fill that area..&#34;</font> SHe paused...<font color = white>&#34; Then theres..division specific...&#34;</font>

She heard the kicking against the solid pavement that the razer-lashed boy was making.. <font color = white>&#34;specific....&#34;</font> It was then she felt the glaring daggers from behind her...<font color = white>&#34; s-specfic missions..?...&#34;</font> Her eyes closed as she then after sweatdropped. 

Her pen rested on her clippboard as she spoke. <font color = white>&#34;um..are you sure you dont have anything...important to take care of?&#34;</font> She asked a bit curiously..her eyes opening to give them a reassuring smile.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would rub shoulders with her family. She would speak up to the ocean haired girl. <font color = white>&#34;Why are you staring at me like that? Are you ok? Am I ok?&#34;</font>

She looked down at herself. She wasnt hurt or anything.

<font color = white>&#34;A medical lisence? Maybe... It depends on what we need!&#34;</font> She got distracted. <font color = white>&#34;Maybe I can make games that will cheer up the patients! I know its boring moping in hospitals all day. I dont know what I want to do yet, but I will help the hospital anyway I can!&#34;</font></font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) 's eyelashes rose revealing a terryfing array of melted gold laid aggressively amongst his irises. With it, his eyes shrunk, further fueling any sense of discomfort one may have had with his brief antics.

The slimmer Akimichi's smile definitely confirmed that she was speaking to him--which, kind of sort of dissolved any semblance he had of remaining patient and obtuse.

Stumbling to his feet, the boy bowed furiously, seemingly attempting to display some sense of apolgy, though after he was finished bowing....
His eyes continued to burn hellfire within the group, definitely seems like something he can't discourage on his own.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned. Mental states...? What the hell was she talking about? Shuye was interested in mending bones, not moods. Her attentioned turned next to Chobina--

<font color = white>&#34;Like what?&#34;</font> She asked, confused. There&#39;s no apology, which might have been odd-- or at least a little confrontational. <font color = white>&#34;You look okay to me.&#34;</font> She would then, finally, turn her attention on the boy between them since it had been pointed out by the other girl.

She would move away from the Akimichi, then. As a nearly-fully-fledged-rookie-ninja, jumping the distance of the arena&#39;s edges was no trouble at all! She landed next to him softly. Her eyes leveled on him, searching to meet with his own. Then she smiled disarmingly, for the first time since she&#39;d shown up.

<font color = white>&#34;Thank you for being patient.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) says: Oh good.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#ff6600>Akimichi, Chobina (The chubby black girl-LionHunter) would relax and look over to Ume as the conversation finished. <font color = white>&#34;Are you ok?&#34;</font> She seemed rather concerned.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) silently side eyes the people discussing things to her left, but alas she wold not make any movements to join the discussions.</font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;..pol....lad...ght? C...do....m....ead?&#34;</font> His voice was practically nonexistent, which didn&#39;t help with the fact that it &lt;i&gt;sounded&lt;/i&gt; like he spouts venom with every utterance.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) kept locking eyes with her little brother. He almost sounded feral, the way he talked. Dripping with emotion, but trying to claw it back. Screaming, but barely above a whisper. Nothing new. An everyday struggle. A jade was a jade, no matter how much settled upon it&#39;s surface. It could always be cut to a finer edge. A brilliant luster. What it was meant to be. Shuye is left to decide whether an aplogy is even necessary, as she doubted others around here would be able to translate him.

When she noticed the heavy breathing boy behind him, Shuye&#39;s reaction is subtle but intentional. She reached out to her younger brother and grasped his hand firmly; almost maternally, rather than sisterly. She pulled him gently toward her, lest he turn around and notice how close the other boy was now.

<font color = white>&#34;Of course, dìdì.&#34;</font> She finally answered. <font color = white>&#34;Choko, my brother didn&#39;t mean to stare.

She halted before him, surprised to find someone actually her height, and age amongst the crowd of young teens.

<br><font color=green>*Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) says: Ishii, Iroha. Ee-shee, ai-roh-hah.

It didn&#39;t sound like a request, but it wasn&#39;t spoken particularly forcefully either.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) held a hand up, waving the Buritos off. <font color = white>&#34;No thanks. I&#39;m not much of a fan of salty snacks. I like sweet snacks.&#34;</font> she explained.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) nods in understanding, grabbing another fistful of chips to snack on. </font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) Huh.
<font color = white>&#34;How.. to aim?&#34;</font>

Aiming. Aiming. Err. Exactly how would someone place words to an explanation like that? Internal questionings surfaced in the wrinkle of brow while he pondered. Uh... 

<font color = white>&#34;It&#39;s nothing special. It&#39;s not something someone can really teach as much as it is something your body learns. You just have to throw a lot. I&#39;ve been throwing things ever since I learned how to close my fingers around objects, so..&#34;</font>

He paused to pluck up a flat stone. A whip of arm sent it spiraling like shuriken for the moat water. It skips a grand total of seven times before hitting the distant northeastern moat-wall with a solid clack!

<font color = white>&#34;.. practice makes perfect?&#34;</font>
He shrugs.</font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) says: In short? I throw by feel. That sounds about right. Instinct.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) rummages in his bag pulling out a package of Pocky. He takes two sticks out and places them in his mouth half of the sticks stick out of his mouth.</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: You need minerals and stuff in your diet.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: See-- wait?!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Why would you do that?!
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: That Hideo guy gets it!
<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: So you can learn how bad it is to eat rocks.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Yeah, that Hideo guy gets it!
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) yells: Everyone should always listen to me!

<br><font color=green>*Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) says: Would you like to eat rocks? I'll help you. It can be hard to swallow, but with a good friend we'll make sure you eat as many as you can fit.
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: I-I can eat rocks all by myself, thank you!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: I'm startin' to learn,

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: You shouuldn't eat rocks..
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) asks: I'll keep you updated, ya hear?
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) yells: Thanks, Hideo!
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Guess it'd be cool to see how you do baking.

<font color = white>&#34;A decent way of looking at it. So. Did you get held back a year or two? Or.. did you get a late start?&#34;</font>

A moment&#39;s spent gazing across the moat, at all their peers, before refocusing on the tall one. 
<font color = white>&#34;I&#39;m the latter. I gave up on learning my family&#39;s... <i>primary business</i> to do this. Never too late to start learning how to do violence for profit. Right?&#34;</font> </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) says: Huh, not too sure what I like doin' for fun.

<font color = white>&#34;Likewise fer me. Couldn&#39; walk fer a year. That didn&#39; help. But ah got better.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) takes a deep breath and and exhales.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) blinked a few times before looking the boy up and down. She blinked a few times before responding, <font color = white>&#34;What&#39;s in it for me?&#34;</font> she asked.</font></font></font>

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#3366ff>Zhu, Shuye (The scowling red-eyed girl-Bonga) frowned at Venturo. Then she turned to her brothjer.

<font color = white>&#34;Don&#39;t let me catch you eating rocks.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Eat as many rocks as you want...
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#666633>Hiren, Kunigami (The dark skinned teen-Sennsa) takes a step back and stands next to Meixun and nudges his awake.
<font color = white>&#34;You can&#39;t be fallin&#39; asleep out here, dude. You might get eaten.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#99cc00>Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) eyes her up and down returning the energy.

<font color = white>&#34;Ill give you an allowance and you&#39;ll get to make me sandwhiches. That sound good?&#34;</font> He asks with a grin.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#e0a972>Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) ||
While Shuye is temporarily keeping her attention off of him, he gives a few 'knowing' winks over toward the other kid's way. He has NO idea who he even is, but he's convinced himself... He will show the fellow kid the way before too long.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) covers his mouth, holding in a snicker</font></font></font>

<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: Hey i could go for a sandwhich.
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: I wish I had an allowance...
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) says: I want a sandwich.
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) says: I know a sandwich sounds good..Hmm..
<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Reilin!  I will adopt you for sandwiches!
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#938a6e>Fuma, Katora (The blond lad-Iodized Salt) tilted his head. Err. Couldn&#39;t walk for a year-- 
Yeah, that sounds like the kind of personal matters anyone with basic common decency shouldn&#39;t ask about. So he didn&#39;t!

<font color = white>&#34;I see. Well. Best of luck to you, in your future laden with dodging rocks for the rest of the year. I won&#39;t go easy on you, if the legal opportunity finds me again,&#34;</font> he told them, wearing an unseen grin. </font></font></font>
<br><font color=green>*Kaido (The troubleaker-EllDante) yells: My new wife is making us all sandwiches..Just put your order in!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Gosu (The plump youth-ZeroAnarchyV3) says: Get me three.

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: Gonna eat like an Akimichi tonight!  YAHOOO!

<br><font color=green>*Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) yells: I can at times.  Six arms gives a gal quite an appetite!
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: Hmm Since its Lunch....
<br><font color=green>*Shingen, Venturo (The two-tone headed boy-Felix Wind) says: ... Now I -really- wish I had six arms...
<br><font color=green>*Utsuwa, Hideo (The red-haired boy-Den Falne Kognen) says: Six arms would be kinda cool...
<br><font color=green>*Akimichi, Chonamu (The heavy breathing kid-VantetheGreat) says: I'll take 22 of the previous order please and thank you.
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#969696>Tsuchigomo, Tsuneko (The six armed albino-RinTonsaka) moves to FLEX her six arms!  She was still growing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#9999ff>Ishii, Iroha (The scuffed girl-Cook44ed) moved on as briskly as that, offering no explanation for her extended spot of immobility.

<font color = white>&#34;Best o&#39; luck fer ye, too. Ah ain&#39; intendin&#39; t&#39;get hit &#39;gain.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#a6de8b>Zhu, Meixun (The razor-lashed boy-Senin Akoihoro) was in a different state of mind when he's.... Focusing. He didn't even acknowledge his new acquaintances' remark, his body simply reacting to the forces with no reply.

Everyone's chakra felt the same, regardless of si--well, no.... Some people's chakra felt, subdued. Though the child still wasn't able to pinpoint exactly who was causing the... Discrepancy within his memory.
He could continue deeper if he'd wish, though it'd more than likely lead him to some unnecessary detailing.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#be0000>Uchiha, Reilin (The somber-looking girl-Spongehero72) &#39;s listened to the offer given before taking a short breath. Just as she exhaled, her once somber demeanour had changed. Her eyes were piercing as she looked toward the boy.

<font color = white>&#34;Oi, oi, oi.. Who tha&#39; heck do ya&#39; take me for? Some kinda&#39; bum? Only one here who&#39;s gonna be makin&#39; sandwiches fer&#39; you is yer&#39; mum. Now buzz off &#39;fore I throw ya&#39; in the water!&#34;</font> she retorted. Her tone was vulgar and riddled with slang. Her once prim-and-proper way of speaking had vanished at the drop of a hat and she&#39;d tilted her nose up, even if she were shorter she found a way to still look down her nose at the boy. She almost seemed like a bit of a delinquent in the moment.</font></font></font>
