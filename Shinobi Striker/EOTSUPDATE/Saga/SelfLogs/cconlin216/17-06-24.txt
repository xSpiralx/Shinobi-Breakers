<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure would slowly turn around as he heard an extra set of footsteps that wasn&#39;t his. The man was covered in all black, looked like he had multiple layers on. When he turned, his entire face was covered by a Red and White Mask. The figure would tilt his head towards the side, before pulling out a book, and what seemed to look like a very fancy pen. Probably the fanciest pen they&#39;ve ever laid eyes on.

The figure would begin to write:

<font color = white>&#34;Is there something you need?&#34;</font> Turning the question, towards them.</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966><a href=?src=[0x300002e];action=name;character=6c45b554595b38848e92e2ca108f26de16f03dadc6cefb69eafb7a3516d9ec26 style = "text-decoration: none; color: #009966;">The cold child</a> would stare up at the man before them. Their cold black eyes observing the black garmants and odd mask that covered his face. It would be noted by the individual that this child was quite small and innocent looking. They would probably also struggle to determine whether it was a male or female.

<font color = white>&#34;I was just curious about your mask.&#34;</font>, they said with child-like glee, their small child like hand extruding from their kimono sleeve which was clearly a bit too long. 

<font color = white>&#34;Where did you get it? Are you like an assassin or something?&#34;</font>, they inquired</font></font></font>
<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure would straighten his head, rather than have it tilt to the side. Through the mask, he would study the rather small child...they looked frail...they looked cold. The individual would remain silent, never speaking even one word. Even while breathing, it didn&#39;t seem like he was exhaling or inhaling through his mouth. However, he would take back to his book and pen, writing things down once again.

<font color = white>&#34;I recieved this mask many many years ago. It was given to me at first due to the kill orders I was beginning to recieve. Let&#39;s just say...I&#39;ve put too many people in the ground, to where I no longer can show my face for my safety, or for this villages.&#34;</font> After which, the masked man would take for a moment, to look at the sky. Even under the mask, would be another black face-mask, wrapped around his neck, and lower face.

Afterwards, he would take attention back towards the cold child. Writing once more.

<font color = white>&#34;And...what of your jacket? Does it not keep you warm? You look like you&#39;re skin is going to freeze ten times over..&#34;</font></font></font></font>

Oddly, they would seemingly be unmoved by the mention of the figure before them, in fact being some sort of assassin. A gentle breeze would blow, causing their hair to lightly flutter in the wind.

<font color = white>&#34;This scarf isn&#39;t really meant for keeping me warm...It&#39;s a momento..&#34;</font>, they said, the child-like innocent slightly cracking to reveal a sort of pain beneath. They would exhale slowly, their eyes looking in the direction of the masked figure, but his stare almost seeming as if he was looking through them.

<font color = white>&#34;It must be hard...Not being able to show your face.&#34;</font>, they said, solemnly.</font></font></font>

Studying their body behavior, before listening to them for a moment. The masked figure would then take to his book and pen once more, before continuing to write.

<font color = white>&#34;At first, it was very hard, but I have grown accustom to this mask. It&#39;s like your scarf, that&#39;s your momento, whereas this is mine. I&#39;ve been wearing this for about Fifteen Years now, and I have never once thought of wanting to show my face.&#34;</font>

He would write, before taking a step closer, in fact, he would bend down to meet with the child&#39;s own height, getting onto one knee. But...even though he was this close, the child still wouldn&#39;t be able to see through the eye slits.

<font color = white>&#34;Tell me....what is the momento for? You lose a loved one or something?&#34;</font></font></font></font>

The slits of the eye mask now level with their own eyes. He would continue to observe the mask, taking mental notes of its intricasies and design.

<font color = white>&#34;Hasn&#39;t everyone lost someone..&#34;</font>, they would say solemnly. His small child-like hand would reach out attempting to touch the mask, if allowed he would simply rest his hand where the cheek would be and speak.

<font color = white>&#34;It has to be awfully lonely. Knowing that when you&#39;re time comes, noone will remember your face. That&#39;s so sad.&#34;</font>, they said, continuing to stare into the masked individuals eye slits.</font></font></font>

In fact...he&#39;d tilt his head towards the child, before slowly raising to his feet.

Moving to the side, and straightening his head once again, he would remain looking through the eye-slits of his mask. Writing down on a seperate piece of paper.

In the next instant, he would feel his hand being squeezed almost to the point of being crushed by the older man though just as quickly as the pressure was applied, it would softly released.

<font color = white>&#34;Ow!&#34;</font>, he yelled out, holding his hand with his other non-squeezed hand, examining it, as a purple and bluish bruise appeared. It did not take much, as he was clearly quite frail.

<font color = white>&#34;Well...That wasn&#39;t very nice.&#34;</font>, he said, as he continued rubbing his bruised hand. <font color = white>&#34;You must not have any friends if that is how you act.

However, he thought it was pretty childish and naive to approach such a towering figure un-armed, especially in the blood-thirsty ninja world. 

Thought: <b>Maybe this is the perfect time to ask</b>

<font color = white>&#34;If you are indeed a shinobi of the village, would you be willing to take me on as a student? I would vow never to speak of your existance nor pesture you for your mentorship.&#34;</font> 

Afro intent was truly to learn the way of the shinobi. 

<font color = white>&#34;As a token of our arrangement would you willing to gift me a single kunai with your engraving?&#34;</font>

Should the figure accept, Afro&#39;s journey as a shinobi would begin. Creating a storyline far different from those in the limelight. </font></font></font>

<font color = white>&#34;I will not apologize for the bruise that has formed on your arm. You would be the same, if you have lived the life I have been through.

<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#b2b2b2>Masked Figure would hear some rather newer voices, one&#39;s he hasn&#39;t even seen or met yet. It had seemed the village was bursting with energy, but...he didnt care for the commotion in which was going on. He didn&#39;t turn his visage towards anyone, in fact, he was focused on one thing and one thing only. The destroyed village that was currently needing to be Reconstructed. So, the masked figure would push his way through the younger generation, giving them no time of day.

He had decided, to be done with conversing for now, especially while there was work to be done. The book and pen, would be placed within his equipment. Before he would finally speak, a low and dark voice would come out of his mask.

<font color = white>&#34;If you wish to fight each other over some trivial matter...then proceed.

But, if you wish to show me your value and worth to the village...then it&#39;s time to put your actions where your mouth is. In but a few moments, I am going to begin Reconstructing our Bridge that was blown up by those damn Dakuteika heathens.

So, either help...or get out of my sight.&#34;</font></font></font></font>
