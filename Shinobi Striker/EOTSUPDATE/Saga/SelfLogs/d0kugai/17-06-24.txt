<br><font size=-3><font color = white><font color=#009966>Tenmu watched the package recipient come down over the hillside. Holding the package in his arms, Tenmu waited until they approached him. He stayed wary. These deliveries usually went smoothly, but there was always the odd chance that the man became hostile. 

Truthfully however, Tenmu was just glad to see a face at all. More often than not the recipient didn't show up or became lost themselves sticking him with a useless package he'd have to dump. And no ryo to show for his time or effort.

When the man greeted him, Tenmu nodded, then passed the delivery off. As quickly as he came the man took off. No goodbye, no thank you, simply gone. Strange as it was, it wasn't Tenmu's place to question. So he let it go and turned to his brother. It was time to head back and wait until another shipment pulled through to complete the process all over again.

It was tedious. Often uneventful even. But, it was better than loitering on the village gates. It gave his mind some day to day direction and that was all anyone could really ask for.

In a couple hours they'd be back to there village. Then again, he wasn't sure he wanted to head back so soon. There was nothing to do there, but wait around, they may as well walk around a bit, scout the area, see if any nukenin were unfortunate enough to cross their path.

This was a much better idea, atleast he thought so. Walking about he wandered, stumbling onto no one yet in particular, but eyes peeled he perhaps would with enough effort. Minutes turn to hours and still no one had crossed their path. But that was fine. This was more for the excuse to walk more than anything else. A walk around the world, as he use to do often.</font></font></font>

As she closes her eyes, she peacefully blends into her environment, allowing her music notes to convey her emotions.

Quickly looking toward Kitsumi he shout,

Getting involved might result in their scandalous activities being directed towards him after all.

As crystals crept up Hideo's frame, the reticent young boy confirmed their insanity, taking solace in the natural concealment offered by the bark of the rather large tree.</font></font></font>
