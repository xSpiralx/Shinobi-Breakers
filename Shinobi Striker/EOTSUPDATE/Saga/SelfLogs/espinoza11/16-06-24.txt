Organs in the wrong places, a chakra system that would make no sense and bursted with activity. Reserves massive in size, with a strange aura that couldn’t be placed correctly with what knowledge lay in hand.

What could she do? The higher ups were present, she had no weapons..

Instead she just focused her self on what she could do.. Scrutinizing the indivudal from top to bottom, her eagle eyes keenly locking onto any unsual properties or hidden gimicks.</font></font></font>

As his eyes scanned the blonde girl, he got a very uneasy feeling. He decided to take a defensive stance, just in case.

<font color = white>&#34;What the hell?&#34;</font> he muttered under his breath.</font></font></font>

The strange scientist with his unsettling presence and the scattered headbands spoke of a dangerous situation. His mind raced, assessing the potential threat and calculating his next move. Despite the scientist's eerie demeanor and the implied threat, Sogeki's stance remained firm and his expression unreadable, masking any fear or concern beneath a veneer of cold resolve.

He knew that action would be required, but for now, Sogeki chose to observe, gathering crucial information and waiting for the right moment to strike. His hand subtly moved towards a concealed weapon, prepared for any sudden developments. In the face of uncertainty and danger, Sogeki's instincts honed in, ready to protect himself and his comrades from whatever this mysterious threat might bring.</font></font></font>

There was a disturbing aura about him, a level of psychosis that was palpable and chilling.



     As a nervous tick, she ran her fingers through her golden locks while her gaze never wavered  as she regarded the bizarre individual who had just issued a dire warning.



<font color = white>&#34;So, let me get this straight,&#34;</font> she began, her tone laced with sarcasm and a hint of defiance. <font color = white>&#34;If we venture into the wilderness, you&#39;re planning to abduct us and transform us into some sort of grotesque and depraved creature such as yourself? Is that what you&#39;re saying?&#34;</font>

She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping to a near whisper,  ashs he  mockingly stated. <font color = white>&#34;Because if that&#39;s your idea of a threat, you might want to reconsider your approach.&#34;</font></font></font></font>

What seemed to be skin and bone was flipping and turning, to reveal a number of mechanisms. His back and arms twist and fold, and his body launches to the side with a number of mechanical creaks.

His head twists around in a three-hundred and sixty degree spiral before it swivels to face the two true Jonin. The body pieces separate and folding, allowing him to immediately slip out of the grasp of the incoming tackle.

<font color = white>&#34;We seek information, but not at the cost of warning. I’ve not come to attack, today, I’m nothing more than an embassy for words today&#34;</font>

The water off to the side begins to ripple, only noticeable by those with attuned senses or abilities such as a Byakugan. While another presence couldn’t be seen though, it could be felt. A chakra system very vaguely seen, almost as if invisible but not.

<font color = white>&#34;Power doesn’t lie in your village, it lies with us. Keep this...&#34;</font> he glances to the two Jonin, <font color = white>&#34;in mind, kids.&#34;</font> He begins to pull off, backing up from the bridge

<font color = white>&#34;I bring your missing headbands as a gesture. Now, assuming you want to keep them and your lives, I think I’ll be going...&#34;</font> his beady, glass eyes, looking back and forth between the shinobi. <font color = white>&#34;And if not, then we could all just...<b><i>go</b></i>&#34;</font> he begins to launch manically as he cast his eyes down to the bridge.

A bridge lined up with hundreds of explosive tags. <font color = white>&#34;If you catch my drift&#34;</font> one of the eyes winks. <font color = white>&#34;But you won’t have time to battle me and save them&#34;</font> A hand begins to form into a symbol, priming the tags but not setting them off.with only a matter of seconds at hand, would the perpetrator find battle?

His instincts kick in sharply. With a quick assessment of the surroundings and the looming danger, he darts to the side, his movements swift and agile as he attempts to evade the potential blast radius.

<font color = white>&#34;Damn it!&#34;</font> Sogeki mutters under his breath, adrenaline coursing through him. He doesn&#39;t engage with the scientist directly, realizing the immediate need to prioritize the safety of himself and the others. His mind races with thoughts of escape routes and strategies to mitigate the imminent threat without escalating the situation further.

As he moves swiftly away from the danger zone, Sogeki&#39;s gaze flickers back towards the scientist and the assembled Jonin. His expression is a mix of frustration and determination, knowing that the situation has escalated beyond a mere confrontation. With a resolve to regroup and strategize further, he gestures urgently for the others to follow suit, seeking cover and safety from the unfolding chaos.</font></font></font>

The Hyuuga was a proud man, believing himself to be the strongest- but he was not foolhardy enough to assume he could both protect and attack at the same time.

In times like this, Matsu knew he could rely on the blessed vessel of the tailed beast. He relinquished all thought of defence and went on an immediate offence. He landing with a heavy thud, poised to attack.

A fraction of a second passed.

A large circle seemed to appear below him and the soon-to-be corpse. Before that very same second ended, Matsu had began a flurry of blows.

<font color = white>&#34;Juukenho!&#34;</font> He shouted, as he delivered two blows. Immediately he delivered 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64 blows! <font color = white>&#34;Hakka Hyaku Bijuhanaho!&#34;</font>

The very ground everyone is standing on begins to cave and quake, leaving nothing but rough terrain not easily crossed to scamper away from. The attacker would rock the puppet’s pieces, only to find the deformed body of a young child inside - his fists now digging into a thin young sternum and lifeless corpse.

The body itself, blowing up once it had been breached. Leaving the attacking Hyuuga with moderate injuries from the resulting explosion.

Papers reign down from above after smoke clears - with a singular message <b><i>we are already here.</b></i> Each of the students just barely scraping by with nothing more than minor injuries as they’re protected from the resulting explosions by their commanders. 
After all that’s left - nothing but splinters and chunks of a young boy’s body remain. The hyuuga’s palms soaked in the child’s blood. A child of Amegakure - a Genin, no less.

The expert use of the water jutsu saved the students from most of the despair, with nothing but be try minor injuries as a result
